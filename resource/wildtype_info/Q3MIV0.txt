UniprotID	Q3MIV0
Accession	Q3MIV0
EntryName	KR221_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 22-1
GeneName	KRTAP22-1 KAP22.1
Length	48
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
