Accession	O75368;Q3SYL1;Q5JT50;Q6FIE8;Q9H0N8
EntryName	SH3L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adapter SH3BGRL (SH3 domain-binding glutamic acid-rich-like protein 1)
GeneName	SH3BGRL
Length	114
Function	Appears to function as an adapter protein that bridges proteins together or proteins with mRNAs (PubMed:34331014). May function as a ubiquitin ligase-substrate adapter (PubMed:34331014, PubMed:34870550). Additionally, associates with translating cytoplasmic ribosomes and may promote the expression of specific mRNAs (PubMed:34331014, PubMed:34870550).
