UniprotID	E5RG62
Accession	E5RG62
EntryName	E5RG62_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deoxyribonuclease TATDN1
GeneName	TATDN1
Length	93
Function	Deoxyribonuclease which catalyzes (in vitro) the decatenation of kinetoplast DNA, which are circular DNA catenated to each other, producing linear DNA molecules. Plays an important role in chromosomal segregation and cell cycle progression during eye development probably via its DNA decatenation activity.
