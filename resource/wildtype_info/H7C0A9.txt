UniprotID	H7C0A9
Accession	H7C0A9
EntryName	H7C0A9_HUMAN
ProteinName	MMS19 nucleotide excision repair protein
GeneName	MMS19
Length	98
Function	Key component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates the incorporation of iron-sulfur cluster into apoproteins specifically involved in DNA metabolism and genomic integrity. In the CIA complex, MMS19 acts as an adapter between early-acting CIA components and a subset of cellular target iron-sulfur proteins.
