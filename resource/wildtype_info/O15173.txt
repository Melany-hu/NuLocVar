UniprotID	O15173
Accession	O15173;Q569H1
EntryName	PGRC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Membrane-associated progesterone receptor component 2 (Progesterone membrane-binding protein) (Steroid receptor protein DG6)
GeneName	PGRMC2 DG6 PMBP
Length	223
Function	Required for the maintenance of uterine histoarchitecture and normal female reproductive lifespan (By similarity). May serve as a universal non-classical progesterone receptor in the uterus (Probable). Intracellular heme chaperone required for delivery of labile, or signaling heme, to the nucleus (By similarity). Plays a role in adipocyte function and systemic glucose homeostasis (PubMed:28111073). In brown fat, which has a high demand for heme, delivery of labile heme in the nucleus regulates the activity of heme-responsive transcriptional repressors such as NR1D1 and BACH1 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Nucleus envelope; Endoplasmic reticulum; Secreted
