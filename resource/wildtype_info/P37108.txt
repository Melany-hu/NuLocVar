UniprotID	P37108
Accession	P37108;B5BUF5;Q6B0K5;Q96Q14
EntryName	SRP14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal recognition particle 14 kDa protein (SRP14) (18 kDa Alu RNA-binding protein)
GeneName	SRP14
Length	136
Function	Component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex, a ribonucleoprotein complex that mediates the cotranslational targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (PubMed:11089964). SRP9 together with SRP14 and the Alu portion of the SRP RNA, constitutes the elongation arrest domain of SRP (PubMed:11089964). The complex of SRP9 and SRP14 is required for SRP RNA binding (PubMed:11089964).
