UniprotID	O15431
Accession	O15431;A8K8Z6;Q53GR5;Q5T1M4
EntryName	COPT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	High affinity copper uptake protein 1 (Copper transporter 1) (hCTR1) (Solute carrier family 31 member 1) [Cleaved into: Truncated CTR1 form]
GeneName	SLC31A1 COPT1 CTR1
Length	190
Function	Uniporter that mediates the transport of copper(1+) from the extracellular space to the cytoplasm, across the plasma membrane (PubMed:11734551, PubMed:16135512, PubMed:17525160, PubMed:19740744, PubMed:20451502, PubMed:20569931, PubMed:23658018) and delivers directly copper(1+) to specific chaperone such as ATOX1, via a copper(1+)- mediated transient interaction between the C-terminal domain and a copper(1+) chaperone, thus controlling intracellular copper(1+) levels (PubMed:11734551, PubMed:16135512, PubMed:17525160, PubMed:19740744, PubMed:20451502, PubMed:20569931, PubMed:23658018, PubMed:26745413). May function in copper(1+) import from the apical membrane thus may drive intestinal copper absorption (By similarity). The copper(1+) transport mechanism is sodium-independent, saturable and of high-affinity (PubMed:11734551). Also mediates the uptake of silver(1+) (PubMed:20569931). May function in the influx of the platinum-containing chemotherapeutic agents (PubMed:20451502, PubMed:20569931). The platinum-containing chemotherapeutic agents uptake is saturable (By similarity). In vitro, mediates the transport of cadmium(2+) into cells (PubMed:33294387). Also participates in the first step of copper(2+) acquisition by cells through a direct transfer of copper(2+) from copper(2+) carriers in blood, such as ALB to the N-terminal domain of SLC31A1, leading to copper(2+) reduction and probably followed by copper(1+) stabilization (PubMed:30489586). In addition, functions as a redox sensor to promote angiogenesis in endothelial cells, in a copper(1+) transport independent manner, by transmitting the VEGF-induced ROS signal through a sulfenylation at Cys-189 leadin g to a subsequent disulfide bond formation between SLC31A1 and KDR (PubMed:35027734). The SLC31A1-KDR complex is then co-internalized to early endosomes, driving a sustained VEGFR2 signaling (PubMed:35027734).
