UniprotID	Q16778
Accession	Q16778;A3KMC7;A8K110;Q4KMY1;Q5QNX0;Q9UE88
EntryName	H2B2E_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type 2-E (H2B-clustered histone 21) (Histone H2B-GL105) (Histone H2B.q) (H2B/q)
GeneName	H2BC21 H2BFQ HIST2H2BE
Length	126
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
