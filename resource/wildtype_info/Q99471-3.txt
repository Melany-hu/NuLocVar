UniprotID	Q99471-3
Accession	Q99471;A8K9A8;Q54AA8;Q9C083;Q9C084
EntryName	PFD5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prefoldin subunit 5 (Myc modulator 1) (c-Myc-binding protein Mm-1)
GeneName	PFDN5 MM1 PFD5
Length	109
Function	Binds specifically to cytosolic chaperonin (c-CPN) and transfers target proteins to it. Binds to nascent polypeptide chain and promotes folding in an environment in which there are many competing pathways for nonnative proteins. Represses the transcriptional activity of MYC.
