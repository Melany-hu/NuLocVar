UniprotID	P16104
Accession	P16104;Q4ZGJ7;Q6IAS5
EntryName	H2AX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2AX (H2a/x) (Histone H2A.X)
GeneName	H2AX H2AFX
Length	143
Function	Variant histone H2A which replaces conventional H2A in a subset of nucleosomes. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling. Required for checkpoint-mediated arrest of cell cycle progression in response to low doses of ionizing radiation and for efficient repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) specifically when modified by C-terminal phosphorylation.
