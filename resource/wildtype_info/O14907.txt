UniprotID	O14907
Accession	O14907;B2RD53;D3DTJ6;Q7LCQ4
EntryName	TX1B3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tax1-binding protein 3 (Glutaminase-interacting protein 3) (Tax interaction protein 1) (TIP-1) (Tax-interacting protein 1)
GeneName	TAX1BP3 TIP1
Length	124
Function	May regulate a number of protein-protein interactions by competing for PDZ domain binding sites. Binds CTNNB1 and may thereby act as an inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway. Competes with LIN7A for KCNJ4 binding, and thereby promotes KCNJ4 internalization. May play a role in the Rho signaling pathway. May play a role in activation of CDC42 by the viral protein HPV16 E6.
