EntryName	SRS10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 10 (40 kDa SR-repressor protein) (SRrp40) (FUS-interacting serine-arginine-rich protein 1) (Splicing factor SRp38) (Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 13A) (TLS-associated protein with Ser-Arg repeats) (TASR) (TLS-associated protein with SR repeats) (TLS-associated serine-arginine protein) (TLS-associated SR protein)
GeneName	SRSF10 FUSIP1 FUSIP2 SFRS13A TASR
Length	173
Function	Splicing factor that in its dephosphorylated form acts as a general repressor of pre-mRNA splicing (PubMed:11684676, PubMed:12419250, PubMed:14765198). Seems to interfere with the U1 snRNP 5'-splice recognition of SNRNP70 (PubMed:14765198). Required for splicing repression in M-phase cells and after heat shock (PubMed:14765198). Also acts as a splicing factor that specifically promotes exon skipping during alternative splicing (PubMed:26876937). Interaction with YTHDC1, a RNA-binding protein that recognizes and binds N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing RNAs, prevents SRSF10 from binding to its mRNA-binding sites close to m6A-containing regions, leading to inhibit exon skipping during alternative splicing (PubMed:26876937). May be involved in regulation of alternative splicing in neurons, with isoform 1 acting as a positive and isoform 3 as a negative regulator (PubMed:12419250).
