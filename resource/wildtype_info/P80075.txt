UniprotID	P80075
Accession	P80075;A0AV77;P78388
EntryName	CCL8_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 8 (HC14) (Monocyte chemoattractant protein 2) (Monocyte chemotactic protein 2) (MCP-2) (Small-inducible cytokine A8) [Cleaved into: MCP-2(6-76)]
GeneName	CCL8 MCP2 SCYA10 SCYA8
Length	99
Function	Chemotactic factor that attracts monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils and eosinophils. May play a role in neoplasia and inflammatory host responses. This protein can bind heparin. The processed form MCP-2(6-76) does not show monocyte chemotactic activity, but inhibits the chemotactic effect most predominantly of CCL7, and also of CCL2 and CCL5 and CCL8.
