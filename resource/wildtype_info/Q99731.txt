UniprotID	Q99731
Accession	Q99731;O00697;O00736
EntryName	CCL19_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 19 (Beta-chemokine exodus-3) (CK beta-11) (Epstein-Barr virus-induced molecule 1 ligand chemokine) (EBI1 ligand chemokine) (ELC) (Macrophage inflammatory protein 3 beta) (MIP-3-beta) (Small-inducible cytokine A19)
GeneName	CCL19 ELC MIP3B SCYA19
Length	98
Function	May play a role not only in inflammatory and immunological responses but also in normal lymphocyte recirculation and homing. May play an important role in trafficking of T-cells in thymus, and T-cell and B-cell migration to secondary lymphoid organs. Binds to chemokine receptor CCR7. Recombinant CCL19 shows potent chemotactic activity for T-cells and B-cells but not for granulocytes and monocytes. Binds to atypical chemokine receptor ACKR4 and mediates the recruitment of beta-arrestin (ARRB1/2) to ACKR4.
