UniprotID	A0A087WZX2
Accession	A0A087WZX2
EntryName	A0A087WZX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 6 (Complex I-B17) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B17 subunit)
GeneName	NDUFB6
Length	97
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
