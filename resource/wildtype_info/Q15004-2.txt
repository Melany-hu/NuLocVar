UniprotID	Q15004-2
Accession	Q15004;A6NNU5;A8K3Y3;G9G694;G9G696
EntryName	PAF15_HUMAN
ProteinName	PCNA-associated factor (Hepatitis C virus NS5A-transactivated protein 9) (HCV NS5A-transactivated protein 9) (Overexpressed in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma 1) (OEATC-1) (PCNA-associated factor of 15 kDa) (PAF15) (p15PAF) (PCNA-clamp-associated factor)
GeneName	PCLAF KIAA0101 NS5ATP9 PAF L5
Length	65
Function	PCNA-binding protein that acts as a regulator of DNA repair during DNA replication. Following DNA damage, the interaction with PCNA is disrupted, facilitating the interaction between monoubiquitinated PCNA and the translesion DNA synthesis DNA polymerase eta (POLH) at stalled replisomes, facilitating the bypass of replication-fork-blocking lesions. Also acts as a regulator of centrosome number.
