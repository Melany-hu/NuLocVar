UniprotID	O75715-2
Accession	O75715;A1A4Y0
EntryName	GPX5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Epididymal secretory glutathione peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.9) (Epididymis-specific glutathione peroxidase-like protein) (EGLP) (Glutathione peroxidase 5) (GPx-5) (GSHPx-5)
GeneName	GPX5
Length	100
Function	Protects cells and enzymes from oxidative damage, by catalyzing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxides and organic hydroperoxide, by glutathione. May constitute a glutathione peroxidase-like protective system against peroxide damage in sperm membrane lipids.
