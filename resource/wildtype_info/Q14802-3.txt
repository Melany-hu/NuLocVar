EntryName	FXYD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 3 (Chloride conductance inducer protein Mat-8) (Mammary tumor 8 kDa protein) (Phospholemman-like) (Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit FXYD3)
GeneName	FXYD3 MAT8 PLML
Length	144
Function	Associates with and regulates the activity of the sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase (NKA) which transports Na(+) out of the cell and K(+) into the cell (PubMed:17077088). Reduces glutathionylation of the NKA beta-1 subunit ATP1B1, thus reversing glutathionylation-mediated inhibition of ATP1B1 (PubMed:21454534). Induces a hyperpolarization-activated chloride current when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (PubMed:7836447).
