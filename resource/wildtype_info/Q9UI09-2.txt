UniprotID	Q9UI09-2
Accession	Q9UI09;F8VQS7;Q53XX0;Q9BRV6
EntryName	NDUAC_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 12 (13 kDa differentiation-associated protein) (Complex I-B17.2) (CI-B17.2) (CIB17.2) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B17.2)
GeneName	NDUFA12 DAP13
Length	63
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
