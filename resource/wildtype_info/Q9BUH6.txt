EntryName	PAXX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein PAXX (Paralog of XRCC4 and XLF) (XRCC4-like small protein)
GeneName	PAXX C9orf142 XLS
Length	204
Function	Non-essential DNA repair protein involved in DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ); participates in double-strand break (DSB) repair and V(D)J recombination (PubMed:25574025, PubMed:25670504, PubMed:25941166, PubMed:27705800). May act as a scaffold required for accumulation of the Ku heterodimer, composed of XRCC5/Ku80 and XRCC6/Ku70, at double-strand break sites and promote the assembly and/or stability of the NHEJ machinery (PubMed:25574025, PubMed:25670504, PubMed:25941166). Involved in NHEJ by promoting the ligation of blunt-ended DNA ends (PubMed:27703001). Together with NHEJ1/XLF, collaborates with DNA polymerase lambda (POLL) to promote joining of non-cohesive DNA ends (PubMed:25670504, PubMed:30250067). Constitutes a non-essential component of classical NHEJ: has a complementary but distinct function with NHEJ1/XLF in DNA repair (PubMed:27705800). Able to restrict infection by herpesvirus 1 (HSV-1) via an unknown mechanism (PubMed:29144403).
