Accession	O14810;A6NI80;B2R4R5;D3DVN3;F1T0G1
EntryName	CPLX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complexin-1 (Complexin I) (CPX I) (Synaphin-2)
GeneName	CPLX1
Length	134
Function	Positively regulates a late step in exocytosis of various cytoplasmic vesicles, such as synaptic vesicles and other secretory vesicles (PubMed:21785414). Organizes the SNAREs into a cross-linked zigzag topology that, when interposed between the vesicle and plasma membranes, is incompatible with fusion, thereby preventing SNAREs from releasing neurotransmitters until an action potential arrives at the synapse (PubMed:21785414). Also involved in glucose-induced secretion of insulin by pancreatic beta-cells. Essential for motor behavior.
