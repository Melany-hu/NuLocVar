EntryName	EDA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ectodysplasin-A (Ectodermal dysplasia protein) (EDA protein) [Cleaved into: Ectodysplasin-A, membrane form; Ectodysplasin-A, secreted form]
GeneName	EDA ED1 EDA2
Length	148
Function	Cytokine which is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal signaling during morphogenesis of ectodermal organs. Functions as a ligand activating the DEATH-domain containing receptors EDAR and EDA2R (PubMed:11039935, PubMed:27144394, PubMed:34582123, PubMed:8696334). May also play a role in cell adhesion (By similarity).
