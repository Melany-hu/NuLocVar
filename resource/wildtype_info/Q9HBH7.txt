UniprotID	Q9HBH7
Accession	Q9HBH7;A0AVN1;A8K4J3;Q9NZ33
EntryName	BEX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein BEX1 (Brain-expressed X-linked protein 1)
GeneName	BEX1
Length	125
Function	Signaling adapter molecule involved in p75NTR/NGFR signaling. Plays a role in cell cycle progression and neuronal differentiation. Inhibits neuronal differentiation in response to nerve growth factor (NGF). May act as a link between the cell cycle and neurotrophic factor signaling, possibly by functioning as an upstream modulator of receptor signaling, coordinating biological responses to external signals with internal cellular states (By similarity). In absence of reductive stress, acts as a pseudosubstrate for the CRL2(FEM1B) complex: associates with FEM1B via zinc, thereby preventing association between FEM1B and its substrates (By similarity).
