UniprotID	P67809
Accession	P67809;P16990;P16991;Q14972;Q15325;Q5FVF0
EntryName	YBOX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1) (CCAAT-binding transcription factor I subunit A) (CBF-A) (DNA-binding protein B) (DBPB) (Enhancer factor I subunit A) (EFI-A) (Nuclease-sensitive element-binding protein 1) (Y-box transcription factor)
GeneName	YBX1 NSEP1 YB1
Length	324
Function	DNA- and RNA-binding protein involved in various processes, such as translational repression, RNA stabilization, mRNA splicing, DNA repair and transcription regulation (PubMed:10817758, PubMed:11698476, PubMed:14718551, PubMed:18809583, PubMed:31358969, PubMed:8188694). Predominantly acts as a RNA-binding protein: binds preferentially to the 5'-CUGCG-3' RNA motif and specifically recognizes mRNA transcripts modified by C5-methylcytosine (m5C) (PubMed:19561594, PubMed:31358969). Promotes mRNA stabilization: acts by binding to m5C-containing mRNAs and recruiting the mRNA stability maintainer ELAVL1, thereby preventing mRNA decay (PubMed:10817758, PubMed:11698476, PubMed:31358969). Component of the CRD-mediated complex that promotes MYC mRNA stability (PubMed:19029303). Contributes to the regulation of translation by modulating the interaction between the mRNA and eukaryotic initiation factors (By similarity). Plays a key role in RNA composition of extracellular exosomes by defining the sorting of small non-coding RNAs, such as tRNAs, Y RNAs, Vault RNAs and miRNAs (PubMed:27559612, PubMed:29073095). Probably sorts RNAs in exosomes by recognizing and binding C5-methylcytosine (m5C)-containing RNAs (PubMed:28341602, PubMed:29073095). Acts as a key effector of epidermal progenitors by preventing epidermal progenitor senescence: acts by regulating the translation of a senescence-associated subset of cytokine mRNAs, possibly by binding to m5C-containing mRNAs (PubMed:29712925). Also involved in pre-mRNA alternative splicing regulation: binds to splice sites in pre-mRNA and regulates splice site selection (PubMed:12604611). Binds to TSC22D1 transcripts, thereby inhibiting their translation and negatively regulating TGF-beta-mediated transcription of COL1A2 (By similarity). Also able to bind DNA: regulates transcription of the multidrug resistance gene MDR1 is enhanced in presence of the APEX1 acetylated form at 'Lys-6' and 'Lys-7' (PubMed:18809583). Binds to promoters that contain a Y-box (5'-CTGATTGGCCAA-3'), such as MDR1 and HLA class II genes (PubMed:18809583, PubMed:8188694). Promotes separation of DNA strands that contain mismatches or are modified by cisplatin (PubMed:14718551). Has endonucleolytic activity and can introduce nicks or breaks into double-stranded DNA, suggesting a role in DNA repair (PubMed:14718551). The secreted form acts as an extracellular mitogen and stimulates cell migration and proliferation (PubMed:19483673).
