EntryName	CD81_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD81 antigen (26 kDa cell surface protein TAPA-1) (Target of the antiproliferative antibody 1) (Tetraspanin-28) (Tspan-28) (CD antigen CD81)
GeneName	CD81 TAPA1 TSPAN28
Length	236
Function	Structural component of specialized membrane microdomains known as tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TERMs), which act as platforms for receptor clustering and signaling. Essential for trafficking and compartmentalization of CD19 receptor on the surface of activated B cells (PubMed:16449649, PubMed:20237408, PubMed:27881302). Upon initial encounter with microbial pathogens, enables the assembly of CD19-CR2/CD21 and B cell receptor (BCR) complexes at signaling TERMs, lowering the threshold dose of antigen required to trigger B cell clonal expansion and antibody production (PubMed:15161911, PubMed:20237408). In T cells, facilitates the localization of CD247/CD3 zeta at antigen-induced synapses with B cells, providing for costimulation and polarization toward T helper type 2 phenotype (PubMed:22307619, PubMed:23858057, PubMed:8766544). Present in MHC class II compartments, may also play a role in antigen presentation (PubMed:8409388, PubMed:8766544). Can act both as positive and negative regulator of homotypic or heterotypic cell-cell fusion processes. Positively regulates sperm-egg fusion and may be involved in acrosome reaction (By similarity). In myoblasts, associates with CD9 and PTGFRN and inhibits myotube fusion during muscle regeneration (By similarity). In macrophages, associates with CD9 and beta-1 and beta-2 integrins, and prevents macrophage fusion into multinucleated giant cells specialized in ingesting complement-opsonized large particles (PubMed:12796480). Also prevents the fusion of mononuclear cell progenitors into osteoclasts in charge of bone resorption (By similarity). May regulate the compartmentalization of enzymatic activities. In T cells, defines the subcellular localization of dNTPase SAMHD1 and permits its degradation by the proteasome, thereby controlling intracellular dNTP levels (PubMed:28871089). Also involved in cell adhesion and motility. Positively regulates integrin-mediated adhesion of macrophages, particularly relevant for the inflammatory response in the lung (By similarity).
