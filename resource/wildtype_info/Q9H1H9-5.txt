Accession	Q9H1H9;A0JP21;A0JP22;F2Z382;Q5THQ2;Q5THQ3;Q9H193;Q9H194;Q9H1H8
EntryName	KI13A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kinesin-like protein KIF13A (Kinesin-like protein RBKIN)
GeneName	KIF13A RBKIN
Length	70
Function	Plus end-directed microtubule-dependent motor protein involved in intracellular transport and regulating various processes such as mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) transport to the plasma membrane, endosomal sorting during melanosome biogenesis and cytokinesis. Mediates the transport of M6PR-containing vesicles from trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane via direct interaction with the AP-1 complex. During melanosome maturation, required for delivering melanogenic enzymes from recycling endosomes to nascent melanosomes by creating peripheral recycling endosomal subdomains in melanocytes. Also required for the abscission step in cytokinesis: mediates translocation of ZFYVE26, and possibly TTC19, to the midbody during cytokinesis.
