UniprotID	E9PQ53
Accession	E9PQ53
EntryName	NDUCR_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 subunit C2, isoform 2 (NDUFC2-KCTD14 readthrough transcript protein)
GeneName	NDUFC2-KCTD14
Length	114
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
