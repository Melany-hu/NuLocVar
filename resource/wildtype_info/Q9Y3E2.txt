UniprotID	Q9Y3E2
Accession	Q9Y3E2;B2R7K2;D3DUZ4;Q5QNY0
EntryName	BOLA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	BolA-like protein 1 (hBolA)
GeneName	BOLA1 CGI-143
Length	137
Function	Acts as a mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly factor that facilitates (Fe-S) cluster insertion into a subset of mitochondrial proteins (By similarity). Probably acts together with the monothiol glutaredoxin GLRX5 (PubMed:27532772). May protect cells against oxidative stress (PubMed:22746225).
