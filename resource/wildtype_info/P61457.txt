UniprotID	P61457
Accession	P61457;P70519;P80095;Q9D930
EntryName	PHS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase (PHS) (EC 4.2.1.96) (4-alpha-hydroxy-tetrahydropterin dehydratase) (Dimerization cofactor of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha) (DCoH) (Dimerization cofactor of HNF1) (Phenylalanine hydroxylase-stimulating protein) (Pterin carbinolamine dehydratase) (PCD)
GeneName	PCBD1 DCOH PCBD
Length	104
Function	Involved in tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis (By similarity). Seems to both prevent the formation of 7-pterins and accelerate the formation of quinonoid-BH2. Coactivator for HNF1A-dependent transcription (By similarity). Regulates the dimerization of homeodomain protein HNF1A and enhances its transcriptional activity (By similarity). Also acts as a coactivator for HNF1B-dependent transcription (PubMed:24204001).
