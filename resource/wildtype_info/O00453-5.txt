EntryName	LST1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leukocyte-specific transcript 1 protein (Protein B144)
GeneName	LST1 B144
Length	59
Function	Possible role in modulating immune responses. Induces morphological changes including production of filopodia and microspikes when overexpressed in a variety of cell types and may be involved in dendritic cell maturation. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 have an inhibitory effect on lymphocyte proliferation.
