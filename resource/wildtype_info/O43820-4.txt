UniprotID	O43820-4
Accession	O43820;O60540;Q8NFK2;Q8NFK3;Q8NFK4;Q96E56;Q9BRW9
EntryName	HYAL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hyaluronidase-3 (Hyal-3) (EC 3.2.1.35) (Hyaluronoglucosaminidase-3) (Lung carcinoma protein 3) (LuCa-3)
GeneName	HYAL3 LUCA3
Length	138
Function	Facilitates sperm penetration into the layer of cumulus cells surrounding the egg by digesting hyaluronic acid. Involved in induction of the acrosome reaction in the sperm. Involved in follicular atresia, the breakdown of immature ovarian follicles that are not selected to ovulate. Induces ovarian granulosa cell apoptosis, possibly via apoptotic signaling pathway involving CASP8 and CASP3 activation, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Has no hyaluronidase activity in embryonic fibroblasts in vitro. Has no hyaluronidase activity in granulosa cells in vitro.
