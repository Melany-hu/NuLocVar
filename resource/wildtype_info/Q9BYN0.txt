EntryName	SRXN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sulfiredoxin-1 (EC 1.8.98.2)
GeneName	SRXN1 C20orf139 SRX SRX1
Length	137
Function	Contributes to oxidative stress resistance by reducing cysteine-sulfinic acid formed under exposure to oxidants in the peroxiredoxins PRDX1, PRDX2, PRDX3 and PRDX4 (PubMed:15448164, PubMed:15590625). Does not act on PRDX5 or PRDX6 (PubMed:15448164, PubMed:15590625). May catalyze the reduction in a multi-step process by acting both as a specific phosphotransferase and a thioltransferase (PubMed:15448164, PubMed:15590625).
