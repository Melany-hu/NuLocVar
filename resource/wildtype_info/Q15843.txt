UniprotID	Q15843
Accession	Q15843;Q3SXN8;Q6LES6
EntryName	NEDD8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 (Neddylin) (Neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 8) (NEDD-8)
GeneName	NEDD8
Length	81
Function	Ubiquitin-like protein which plays an important role in cell cycle control and embryogenesis via its conjugation to a limited number of cellular proteins, such as cullins or p53/TP53 (PubMed:10318914, PubMed:10597293, PubMed:11953428, PubMed:14690597, PubMed:15242646, PubMed:9694792, PubMed:38605244, PubMed:38316879). Attachment of NEDD8 to cullins is critical for the recruitment of E2 to the cullin-RING-based E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, thus facilitating polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of cyclins and other regulatory proteins (PubMed:10318914, PubMed:10597293, PubMed:11953428, PubMed:20688984, PubMed:9694792, PubMed:38605244, PubMed:38316879). Attachment of NEDD8 to p53/TP53 inhibits p53/TP53 transcriptional activity (PubMed:15242646). Covalent attachment to its substrates requires prior activation by the E1 complex UBE1C-APPBP1 and linkage to the E2 enzyme UBE2M (PubMed:14690597).
