UniprotID	Q5U5X0
Accession	Q5U5X0;A8MPQ9;Q86Y68
EntryName	LYRM7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complex III assembly factor LYRM7 (LYR motif-containing protein 7)
GeneName	LYRM7 C5orf31 MZM1L
Length	104
Function	Assembly factor required for Rieske Fe-S protein UQCRFS1 incorporation into the cytochrome b-c1 (CIII) complex. Functions as a chaperone, binding to this subunit within the mitochondrial matrix and stabilizing it prior to its translocation and insertion into the late CIII dimeric intermediate within the mitochondrial inner membrane.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
