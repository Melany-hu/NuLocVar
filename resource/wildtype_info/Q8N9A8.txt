UniprotID	Q8N9A8
Accession	Q8N9A8;Q4G1A9;Q5H9V0;Q8NE06
EntryName	NEPR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear envelope phosphatase-regulatory subunit 1 (NEP1-R1) (Transmembrane protein 188)
GeneName	CNEP1R1 C16orf69 TMEM188
Length	125
Function	Forms with the serine/threonine protein phosphatase CTDNEP1 an active complex which dephosphorylates and may activate LPIN1 and LPIN2. LPIN1 and LPIN2 are phosphatidate phosphatases that catalyze the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol and control the metabolism of fatty acids at different levels. May indirectly modulate the lipid composition of nuclear and/or endoplasmic reticulum membranes and be required for proper nuclear membrane morphology and/or dynamics. May also indirectly regulate the production of lipid droplets and triacylglycerol.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus membrane; Cytoplasm
