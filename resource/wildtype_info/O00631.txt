UniprotID	O00631
Accession	O00631;Q6ICV3
EntryName	SARCO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sarcolipin
GeneName	SLN
Length	31
Function	Reversibly inhibits the activity of ATP2A1/SERCA1 and ATP2A2/SERCA2 in sarcoplasmic reticulum by decreasing the apparent affinity of the ATPase for Ca(2+) (PubMed:11781085, PubMed:9575189). Also inhibits the activity of ATP2A3/SERCA3 (By similarity). Modulates calcium re-uptake during muscle relaxation and plays an important role in calcium homeostasis in muscle. Required for muscle-based, non-shivering thermogenesis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
