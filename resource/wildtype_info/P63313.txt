UniprotID	P63313
Accession	P63313;P13472;Q596K9
EntryName	TYB10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thymosin beta-10
GeneName	TMSB10 PTMB10 THYB10
Length	44
Function	Plays an important role in the organization of the cytoskeleton. Binds to and sequesters actin monomers (G actin) and therefore inhibits actin polymerization (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
