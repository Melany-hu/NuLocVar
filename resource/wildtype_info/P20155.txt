UniprotID	P20155
Accession	P20155;Q6FGH2
EntryName	ISK2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 2 (Acrosin-trypsin inhibitor) (Epididymis tissue protein Li 172) (HUSI-II)
GeneName	SPINK2
Length	84
Function	As a strong inhibitor of acrosin, it is required for normal spermiogenesis. It probably hinders premature activation of proacrosin and other proteases, thus preventing the cascade of events leading to spermiogenesis defects (PubMed:28554943). May be involved in the regulation of serine protease-dependent germ cell apoptosis (By similarity). It also inhibits trypsin.
