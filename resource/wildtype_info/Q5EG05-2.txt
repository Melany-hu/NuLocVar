UniprotID	Q5EG05-2
Accession	Q5EG05;Q96RJ9
EntryName	CAR16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 16 (Caspase recruitment domain-only protein 1) (CARD-only protein 1) (Caspase-1 inhibitor COP) (Pseudo interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme) (Pseudo-ICE) (Pseudo-IL1B-converting enzyme)
GeneName	CARD16 COP COP1
Length	97
Function	Caspase inhibitor. Acts as a regulator of procaspase-1/CASP1 activation implicated in the regulation of the proteolytic maturation of pro-interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) and its release during inflammation. Inhibits the release of IL1B in response to LPS in monocytes. Also induces NF-kappa-B activation during the pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Also able to inhibit CASP1-mediated neuronal cell death, TNF-alpha, hypoxia-, UV-, and staurosporine-mediated cell death but not ER stress-mediated cell death. Acts by preventing activation of caspases CASP1 and CASP4, possibly by preventing the interaction between CASP1 and RIPK2.
