UniprotID	Q02363
Accession	Q02363
EntryName	ID2_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-binding protein inhibitor ID-2 (Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 26) (bHLHb26) (Inhibitor of DNA binding 2) (Inhibitor of differentiation 2)
GeneName	ID2 BHLHB26
Length	134
Function	Transcriptional regulator (lacking a basic DNA binding domain) which negatively regulates the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors by forming heterodimers and inhibiting their DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Implicated in regulating a variety of cellular processes, including cellular growth, senescence, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and neoplastic transformation. Inhibits skeletal muscle and cardiac myocyte differentiation. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer. Restricts the CLOCK and BMAL1 localization to the cytoplasm. Plays a role in both the input and output pathways of the circadian clock: in the input component, is involved in modulating the magnitude of photic entrainment and in the output component, contributes to the regulation of a variety of liver clock-controlled genes involved in lipid metabolism.
