UniprotID	P04921-3
Accession	P04921;B2R522;Q53SV9;Q92642
EntryName	GLPC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycophorin-C (Glycoconnectin) (Glycophorin-D) (GPD) (Glycoprotein beta) (PAS-2') (Sialoglycoprotein D) (CD antigen CD236)
GeneName	GYPC GLPC GPC
Length	109
Function	This protein is a minor sialoglycoprotein in human erythrocyte membranes. The blood group Gerbich antigens and receptors for Plasmodium falciparum merozoites are most likely located within the extracellular domain. Glycophorin-C plays an important role in regulating the stability of red cells.
