UniprotID	Q5HYL7-2
Accession	Q5HYL7;Q8N6I6
EntryName	TM196_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 196
GeneName	TMEM196
Length	104
Function	Acts as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer (PubMed:26056045, PubMed:36355209). Inhibits tumor cell growth by inhibiting cell proliferation and migration and promoting cell apoptosis (PubMed:26056045, PubMed:36355209). Inhibits metastasis of lung cancer by suppressing beta-catenin expression in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (By similarity).
