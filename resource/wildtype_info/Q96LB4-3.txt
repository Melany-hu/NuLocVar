UniprotID	Q96LB4-3
Accession	Q96LB4;Q495K2;Q495K4;Q5T9L6
EntryName	VATG3_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit G 3 (V-ATPase subunit G 3) (V-ATPase 13 kDa subunit 3) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit G 3)
GeneName	ATP6V1G3 ATP6G3
Length	59
Function	Subunit of the V1 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons. V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment.
