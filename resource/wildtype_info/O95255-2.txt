Accession	O95255;A2RRN8;A8KIG6;A8Y988;E7ESW8;P78420;Q8TCY8;Q9UMZ7
EntryName	MRP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 6 (EC 7.6.2.-) (EC 7.6.2.3) (Anthracycline resistance-associated protein) (Multi-specific organic anion transporter E) (MOAT-E) (Multidrug resistance-associated protein 6)
GeneName	ABCC6 ARA MRP6
Length	99
Function	ATP-dependent transporter of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family that actively extrudes physiological compounds, and xenobiotics from cells. Mediates ATP-dependent transport of glutathione conjugates such as leukotriene-c4 (LTC4) and N-ethylmaleimide S-glutathione (NEM-GS) (in vitro), and an anionic cyclopentapeptide endothelin antagonist, BQ-123 (PubMed:11880368, PubMed:12414644). May contribute to regulate the transport of organic compounds in testes across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable). Does not appear to actively transport drugs outside the cell. Confers low levels of cellular resistance to etoposide, teniposide, anthracyclines and cisplatin (PubMed:12414644).
