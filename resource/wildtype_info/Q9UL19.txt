UniprotID	Q9UL19
Accession	Q9UL19;B2R599;B4DDW2;E7ENZ7;O95200
EntryName	PLAT4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholipase A and acyltransferase 4 (EC 2.3.1.-) (EC 3.1.1.32) (EC 3.1.1.4) (HRAS-like suppressor 4) (HRSL4) (RAR-responsive protein TIG3) (Retinoic acid receptor responder protein 3) (Retinoid-inducible gene 1 protein) (Tazarotene-induced gene 3 protein)
GeneName	PLAAT4 RARRES3 RIG1 TIG3
Length	164
Function	Exhibits both phospholipase A1/2 and acyltransferase activities (PubMed:19615464, PubMed:22605381, PubMed:22825852, PubMed:26503625). Shows phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and A2 (PLA2), catalyzing the calcium-independent release of fatty acids from the sn-1 or sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids (PubMed:19615464, PubMed:22605381, PubMed:22825852). For most substrates, PLA1 activity is much higher than PLA2 activity (PubMed:19615464). Shows O-acyltransferase activity, catalyzing the transfer of a fatty acyl group from glycerophospholipid to the hydroxyl group of lysophospholipid (PubMed:19615464). Shows N-acyltransferase activity, catalyzing the calcium-independent transfer of a fatty acyl group at the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and other glycerophospholipids to the primary amine of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), forming N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), which serves as precursor for N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) (PubMed:19615464, PubMed:22605381, PubMed:22825852). Promotes keratinocyte differentiation via activation of TGM1 (PubMed:17762858).
