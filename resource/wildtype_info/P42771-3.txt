UniprotID	P42771-3
Accession	P42771;A5X2G7;D3DRK1;G3XAG3;O95440;Q15191;Q5VVJ5;Q96B52;Q9NP05
EntryName	CDN2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 inhibitor A) (CDK4I) (Multiple tumor suppressor 1) (MTS-1) (p16-INK4a) (p16-INK4) (p16INK4A)
GeneName	CDKN2A CDKN2 MTS1
Length	116
Function	Acts as a negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells by interacting strongly with CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibits their ability to interact with cyclins D and to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein.
