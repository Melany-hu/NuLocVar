UniprotID	P61165
Accession	P61165;A8K6L8;Q9D953;Q9Y2Q7
EntryName	TM258_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase subunit TMEM258 (Oligosaccharyl transferase subunit TMEM258) (Transmembrane protein 258)
GeneName	TMEM258 C11orf10 HSPC005
Length	79
Function	Subunit of the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) complex that catalyzes the initial transfer of a defined glycan (Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) in eukaryotes) from the lipid carrier dolichol-pyrophosphate to an asparagine residue within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif in nascent polypeptide chains, the first step in protein N-glycosylation (PubMed:31831667). N-glycosylation occurs cotranslationally and the complex associates with the Sec61 complex at the channel-forming translocon complex that mediates protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). All subunits are required for a maximal enzyme activity (PubMed:26472760, PubMed:27974209). Involved in ER homeostasis in the colonic epithelium (By similarity).
