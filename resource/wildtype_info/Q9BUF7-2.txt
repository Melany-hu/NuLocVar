UniprotID	Q9BUF7-2
Accession	Q9BUF7;A8KA91;D6W643;Q8N0V8;Q8WVA0
EntryName	CRUM3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein crumbs homolog 3
GeneName	CRB3 UNQ588/PRO1158
Length	123
Function	Involved in the establishment of cell polarity in mammalian epithelial cells (PubMed:12771187, PubMed:14718572, PubMed:23439680). Regulates the morphogenesis of tight junctions (PubMed:12771187, PubMed:14718572). Involved in promoting phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of transcriptional coactivators YAP1 and WWTR1/TAZ which leads to suppression of TGFB1-dependent transcription of target genes such as CCN2/CTGF, SERPINE1/PAI1, SNAI1/SNAIL1 and SMAD7 (By similarity).
