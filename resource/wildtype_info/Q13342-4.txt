EntryName	SP140_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear body protein SP140 (Lymphoid-restricted homolog of Sp100) (LYSp100) (Nuclear autoantigen Sp-140) (Speckled 140 kDa)
GeneName	SP140 LYSP100
Length	172
Function	Component of the nuclear body, also known as nuclear domain 10, PML oncogenic domain, and KR body (PubMed:8910577). May be involved in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia and viral infection (PubMed:8910577). May play a role in chromatin-mediated regulation of gene expression although it does not bind to histone H3 tails (PubMed:24267382).
