UniprotID	Q9BW72
Accession	Q9BW72
EntryName	HIG2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	HIG1 domain family member 2A, mitochondrial (RCF1 homolog B) (RCF1b)
GeneName	HIGD2A
Length	106
Function	Proposed subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX, complex IV), which is the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. May be involved in cytochrome c oxidase activity. May play a role in the assembly of respiratory supercomplexes.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion membrane; Mitochondrion inner membrane
