EntryName	HYPK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Huntingtin-interacting protein K (Huntingtin yeast partner K)
GeneName	HYPK C15orf63 HSPC136
Length	121
Function	Component of several N-terminal acetyltransferase complexes (PubMed:20154145, PubMed:29754825, PubMed:32042062). Inhibits the N-terminal acetylation activity of the N-terminal acetyltransferase NAA10-NAA15 complex (also called the NatA complex) (PubMed:29754825, PubMed:32042062). Has chaperone-like activity preventing polyglutamine (polyQ) aggregation of HTT in neuronal cells probably while associated with the NatA complex (PubMed:17947297, PubMed:20154145). May play a role in the NatA complex-mediated N-terminal acetylation of PCNP (PubMed:20154145).
