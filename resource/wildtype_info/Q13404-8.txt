EntryName	UB2V1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 1 (UEV-1) (CROC-1) (TRAF6-regulated IKK activator 1 beta Uev1A)
GeneName	UBE2V1 CROC1 UBE2V UEV1 P/OKcl.19
Length	105
Function	Has no ubiquitin ligase activity on its own. The UBE2V1-UBE2N heterodimer catalyzes the synthesis of non-canonical poly-ubiquitin chains that are linked through Lys-63. This type of poly-ubiquitination activates IKK and does not seem to involve protein degradation by the proteasome. Plays a role in the activation of NF-kappa-B mediated by IL1B, TNF, TRAF6 and TRAF2. Mediates transcriptional activation of target genes. Plays a role in the control of progress through the cell cycle and differentiation. Plays a role in the error-free DNA repair pathway and contributes to the survival of cells after DNA damage. Promotes TRIM5 capsid-specific restriction activity and the UBE2V1-UBE2N heterodimer acts in concert with TRIM5 to generate 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains which activate the MAP3K7/TAK1 complex which in turn results in the induction and expression of NF-kappa-B and MAPK-responsive inflammatory genes. Together with RNF135 and UBE2N, catalyzes the viral RNA-dependent 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIGI to activate the downstream signaling pathway that leads to interferon beta production (PubMed:31006531). UBE2V1-UBE2N together with TRAF3IP2 E3 ubiquitin ligase mediate 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF6, a component of IL17A-mediated signaling pathway.
