UniprotID	Q8TAD4-4
Accession	Q8TAD4;B7ZM89;Q6UX54;Q7L4M4;Q8TDG3;Q9BVY8;Q9H9H1
EntryName	ZNT5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proton-coupled zinc antiporter SLC30A5 (Solute carrier family 30 member 5) (Zinc transporter 5) (ZnT-5) (ZnT-like transporter 1) (hZTL1)
GeneName	SLC30A5 ZNT5 ZNTL1 ZTL1 UNQ863/PRO1879
Length	77
Function	Together with SLC30A6 forms a functional proton-coupled zinc ion antiporter mediating zinc entry into the lumen of organelles along the secretory pathway (PubMed:11904301, PubMed:15525635, PubMed:15994300, PubMed:19366695, PubMed:22529353). By contributing to zinc ion homeostasis within the early secretory pathway, regulates the activation and folding of enzymes like alkaline phosphatases and enzymes involved in phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis (PubMed:15525635, PubMed:15994300, PubMed:16636052, PubMed:35525268). Through the transport of zinc into secretory granules of pancreatic beta-cells, plays an important role in the storage and secretion of insulin (PubMed:11904301).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; COPII-coated vesicle membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle membrane; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Cell membrane; Apical cell membrane
