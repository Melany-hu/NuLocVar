UniprotID	Q8WXC6
Accession	Q8WXC6;Q8N110
EntryName	CSN9_HUMAN
ProteinName	COP9 signalosome complex subunit 9 (CSN acidic protein) (CSNAP) (Myeloma-overexpressed gene 2 protein)
GeneName	COPS9 MYEOV2
Length	57
Function	Component of the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN), a complex involved in various cellular and developmental processes. The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF-type complexes such as SCF, CSA or DDB2. The complex is also involved in phosphorylation of p53/TP53, c-jun/JUN, IkappaBalpha/NFKBIA, ITPK1 and IRF8/ICSBP, possibly via its association with CK2 and PKD kinases. CSN-dependent phosphorylation of TP53 and JUN promotes and protects degradation by the Ubl system, respectively. Plays a role in cell proliferation.
