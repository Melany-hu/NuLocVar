EntryName	CALM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calmodulin-1
GeneName	CALM1 CALM CAM CAM1
Length	149
Function	Calmodulin acts as part of a calcium signal transduction pathway by mediating the control of a large number of enzymes, ion channels, aquaporins and other proteins through calcium-binding (PubMed:16760425, PubMed:23893133, PubMed:26969752, PubMed:27165696, PubMed:28890335, PubMed:31454269, PubMed:35568036). Calcium-binding is required for the activation of calmodulin (PubMed:16760425, PubMed:23893133, PubMed:26969752, PubMed:27165696, PubMed:28890335, PubMed:31454269, PubMed:35568036). Among the enzymes to be stimulated by the calmodulin-calcium complex are a number of protein kinases, such as myosin light-chain kinases and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMK2), and phosphatases (PubMed:16760425, PubMed:23893133, PubMed:26969752, PubMed:27165696, PubMed:28890335, PubMed:31454269, PubMed:35568036). Together with CCP110 and centrin, is involved in a genetic pathway that regulates the centrosome cycle and progression through cytokinesis (PubMed:16760425). Is a regulator of voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels (PubMed:31454269). Mediates calcium-dependent inactivation of CACNA1C (PubMed:26969752). Positively regulates calcium-activated potassium channel activity of KCNN2 (PubMed:27165696). Forms a potassium channel complex with KCNQ1 and regulates electrophysiological activity of the channel via calcium-binding (PubMed:25441029). Acts as a sensor to modulate the endoplasmic reticulum contacts with other organelles mediated by VMP1:ATP2A2 (PubMed:28890335).
