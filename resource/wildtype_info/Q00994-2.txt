UniprotID	Q00994-2
Accession	Q00994;B2RD17;D3DXA3;Q5JQT4;Q5JQT5
EntryName	BEX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein BEX3 (Brain-expressed X-linked protein 3) (Nerve growth factor receptor-associated protein 1) (Ovarian granulosa cell 13.0 kDa protein HGR74) (p75NTR-associated cell death executor)
GeneName	BEX3 DXS6984E NADE NGFRAP1
Length	101
Function	May be a signaling adapter molecule involved in NGFR/p75NTR-mediated apoptosis induced by NGF. Plays a role in zinc-triggered neuronal death. In absence of reductive stress, acts as a pseudosubstrate for the CRL2(FEM1B) complex: associates with FEM1B via zinc, thereby preventing association between FEM1B and its substrates.
