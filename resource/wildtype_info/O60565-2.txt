UniprotID	O60565-2
Accession	O60565;Q52LV3;Q8N914;Q8N936
EntryName	GREM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gremlin-1 (Cell proliferation-inducing gene 2 protein) (Cysteine knot superfamily 1, BMP antagonist 1) (DAN domain family member 2) (Down-regulated in Mos-transformed cells protein) (Increased in high glucose protein 2) (IHG-2)
GeneName	GREM1 CKTSF1B1 DAND2 DRM PIG2
Length	143
Function	Cytokine that may play an important role during carcinogenesis and metanephric kidney organogenesis, as a BMP antagonist required for early limb outgrowth and patterning in maintaining the FGF4-SHH feedback loop. Down-regulates the BMP4 signaling in a dose-dependent manner (By similarity). Antagonist of BMP2; inhibits BMP2-mediated differentiation of osteoblasts (in vitro) (PubMed:27036124). Acts as inhibitor of monocyte chemotaxis. Can inhibit the growth or viability of normal cells but not transformed cells when is overexpressed (By similarity).
