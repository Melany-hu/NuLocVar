Accession	Q9UBF6;A8K1H9;A8MTB5;C9JYL3;D3DNF7;D3DNF8;Q9BXN8;Q9Y5M7
EntryName	RBX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	RING-box protein 2 (Rbx2) (EC 2.3.2.27) (EC 2.3.2.32) (CKII beta-binding protein 1) (CKBBP1) (RING finger protein 7) (Regulator of cullins 2) (Sensitive to apoptosis gene protein)
GeneName	RNF7 RBX2 ROC2 SAG
Length	97
Function	Catalytic component of multiple cullin-5-RING E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes (ECS complexes), which mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:21980433, PubMed:33268465, PubMed:38418882, PubMed:38574733). It is thereby involved in various biological processes, such as cell cycle progression, signal transduction and transcription (PubMed:21980433, PubMed:33268465, PubMed:38418882, PubMed:38574733). The functional specificity of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ECS complexes depend on the variable SOCS box-containing substrate recognition component (PubMed:21980433, PubMed:33268465). Within ECS complexes, RNF7/RBX2 recruits the E2 ubiquitination enzyme to the complex via its RING-type and brings it into close proximity to the substrate (PubMed:34518685). Catalytic subunit of various SOCS-containing ECS complexes, such as the ECS(SOCS7) complex, that regulate reelin signaling by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of DAB1 (By similarity). The ECS(SOCS2) complex mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of phosphorylated EPOR and GHR (PubMed:21980433, PubMed:25505247). Promotes ubiquitination and degradation of NF1, thereby regulating Ras protein signal transduction (By similarity). As part of the ECS(ASB9) complex, catalyzes ubiquitination and degradation of CKB (PubMed:33268465). The ECS(SPSB3) complex catalyzes ubiquitination of nuclear CGAS (PubMed:38418882). As part of some ECS complex, catalyzes 'Lys-11'-linked ubiquitination and degradation of BTRC (PubMed:27910872). ECS complexes and ARIH2 collaborate in tandem to mediate ubiquitination of target proteins; ARIH2 mediating addition of the first ubiquitin on CRLs targets (PubMed:34518685, PubMed:38418882). Specifically catalyzes the neddylation of CUL5 via its interaction with UBE2F (PubMed:19250909). Does not catalyze neddylation of other cullins (CUL1, CUL2, CUL3, CUL4A or CUL4B) (PubMed:19250909). May play a role in protecting cells from apoptosis induced by redox agents (PubMed:10082581).
