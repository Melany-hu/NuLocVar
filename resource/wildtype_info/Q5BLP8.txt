UniprotID	Q5BLP8
Accession	Q5BLP8;B6ZDN0;B7ZBI7;B7ZBI8;X6RBU3
EntryName	NICOL_HUMAN
ProteinName	NELL2-interacting cell ontogeny regulator 1 (NELL2-interacting cofactor for lumicrine signaling) (NICOL)
GeneName	NICOL1 C4orf48
Length	95
Function	mRNA-binding protein which interacts with a range of target mRNAs including SERPINE1, ACTA2, CCN2 and COL4A1 and may promote extracellular matrix production. Binds to the 3'-UTR of SERPINE1 mRNA and stabilizes the mRNA, possibly by competing for binding with SERBP1 and preventing SERBP1-mediated mRNA degradation. Also binds to the 3'-UTR of ACTA2. Testis-derived lumicrine factor that triggers epididymal differentiation and sperm maturation.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region
