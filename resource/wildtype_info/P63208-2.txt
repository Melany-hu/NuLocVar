UniprotID	P63208-2
Accession	P63208;D3DQ97;D3DQ98;P34991;Q8TAY2
EntryName	SKP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Cyclin-A/CDK2-associated protein p19) (p19A) (Organ of Corti protein 2) (OCP-2) (Organ of Corti protein II) (OCP-II) (RNA polymerase II elongation factor-like protein) (SIII) (Transcription elongation factor B polypeptide 1-like) (p19skp1)
GeneName	SKP1 EMC19 OCP2 SKP1A TCEB1L
Length	160
Function	Essential component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination of proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction and transcription. In the SCF complex, serves as an adapter that links the F-box protein to CUL1. The functional specificity of the SCF complex depends on the F-box protein as substrate recognition component. SCF(BTRC) and SCF(FBXW11) direct ubiquitination of CTNNB1 and participate in Wnt signaling. SCF(FBXW11) directs ubiquitination of phosphorylated NFKBIA. SCF(BTRC) directs ubiquitination of NFKBIB, NFKBIE, ATF4, SMAD3, SMAD4, CDC25A, FBXO5, CEP68 and probably NFKB2 (PubMed:25704143). SCF(SKP2) directs ubiquitination of phosphorylated CDKN1B/p27kip and is involved in regulation of G1/S transition. SCF(SKP2) directs ubiquitination of ORC1, CDT1, RBL2, ELF4, CDKN1A, RAG2, FOXO1A, and probably MYC and TAL1. SCF(FBXW7) directs ubiquitination of cyclin E, NOTCH1 released notch intracellular domain (NICD), and probably PSEN1. SCF(FBXW2) directs ubiquitination of GCM1. SCF(FBXO32) directs ubiquitination of MYOD1. SCF(FBXO7) directs ubiquitination of BIRC2 and DLGAP5. SCF(FBXO33) directs ubiquitination of YBX1. SCF(FBXO11) directs ubiquitination of BCL6 and DTL but does not seem to direct ubiquitination of TP53. SCF(BTRC) mediates the ubiquitination of NFKBIA at 'Lys-21' and 'Lys-22'; the degradation frees the associated NFKB1-RELA dimer to translocate into the nucleus and to activate transcription. SCF(CCNF) directs ubiquitination of CCP110. SCF(FBXL3) and SCF(FBXL21) direct ubiquitination of CRY1 and CRY2. SCF(FBXO9) directs ubiquitination of TTI1 and TELO2. SCF(FBXO10) directs ubiquitination of BCL2. Core component of the Cul7-RING(FBXW8) ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:35982156). Also acts as a core component of the Cul1-RING(FBXL4) ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of BNIP3 and BNI3L (PubMed:36896912).
