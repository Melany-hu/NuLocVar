UniprotID	P62081
Accession	P62081;P23821;P24818;Q57Z92;Q6IPH1
EntryName	RS7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein eS7 (40S ribosomal protein S7)
GeneName	RPS7
Length	194
Function	Component of the small ribosomal subunit (PubMed:23636399). The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:23636399). Required for rRNA maturation (PubMed:19061985). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
