UniprotID	Q9NPJ3-2
Accession	Q9NPJ3;F5H2L4;O95549
EntryName	ACO13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 13 (Acyl-CoA thioesterase 13) (EC 3.1.2.-) (Hotdog-fold thioesterase superfamily member 2) (Palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase) (EC 3.1.2.2) (Thioesterase superfamily member 2) (THEM2) [Cleaved into: Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 13, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	ACOT13 THEM2 HT012 PNAS-27
Length	117
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoASH), regulating their respective intracellular levels (PubMed:16934754, PubMed:19170545). Has acyl-CoA thioesterase activity towards medium (C12) and long-chain (C18) fatty acyl-CoA substrates (By similarity) (PubMed:16934754, PubMed:19170545). Can also hydrolyze 3-hydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA (in vitro) (By similarity) (PubMed:16934754, PubMed:19170545). May play a role in controlling adaptive thermogenesis (By similarity).
