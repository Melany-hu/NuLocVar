UniprotID	P60002
Accession	P60002;Q8R1J7;Q96II4
EntryName	ELOF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription elongation factor 1 homolog
GeneName	ELOF1
Length	83
Function	Factor involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), a mechanism that rapidly removes RNA polymerase II-blocking lesions from the transcribed strand of active genes (PubMed:34108662, PubMed:34108663, PubMed:38316879). Acts as a key adapter required to anchor TC-NER factors to RNA polymerase II: stably positions UVSSA and the DCX(ERCC8) complex (also named CSA complex) on arrested RNA polymerase II, leading to neddylation and activation of the DCX(ERCC8) complex and ubiquitination of RNA polymerase II (PubMed:38316879).
