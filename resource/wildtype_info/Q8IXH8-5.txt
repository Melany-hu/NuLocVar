Accession	Q8IXH8;A2A2M5;B3KNX3;Q6P5Y6;Q8TCH3;Q9BQN4;Q9NRU1
EntryName	CAD26_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cadherin-like protein 26 (Cadherin-like protein VR20)
GeneName	CDH26
Length	124
Function	Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell adhesion proteins. They preferentially interact with themselves in a homophilic manner in connecting cells; cadherins may thus contribute to the sorting of heterogeneous cell types. Ligand for integrins alpha-E/beta-7, ITGAE:ITGAB7, alpha-4/beta-7, ITGA4:ITGAB7 and alpha-4/beta-1, ITGA4:ITGAB1 through which modulates CD4(+) T cells activation (PubMed:28051089).
