EntryName	CD86_HUMAN
ProteinName	T-lymphocyte activation antigen CD86 (Activation B7-2 antigen) (B70) (BU63) (CTLA-4 counter-receptor B7.2) (FUN-1) (CD antigen CD86)
GeneName	CD86 CD28LG2
Length	110
Function	Receptor involved in the costimulatory signal essential for T-lymphocyte proliferation and interleukin-2 production, by binding CD28 or CTLA-4 (PubMed:12196291). May play a critical role in the early events of T-cell activation and costimulation of naive T-cells, such as deciding between immunity and anergy that is made by T-cells within 24 hours after activation (PubMed:7527824). Also involved in the regulation of B cells function, plays a role in regulating the level of IgG(1) produced. Upon CD40 engagement, activates NF-kappa-B signaling pathway via phospholipase C and protein kinase C activation (By similarity).
