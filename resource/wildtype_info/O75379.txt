UniprotID	O75379
Accession	O75379;A2IDD8;Q96IY9;Q96J20;Q9UEL7
EntryName	VAMP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vesicle-associated membrane protein 4 (VAMP-4)
GeneName	VAMP4
Length	141
Function	Involved in the pathway that functions to remove an inhibitor (probably synaptotagmin-4) of calcium-triggered exocytosis during the maturation of secretory granules. May be a marker for this sorting pathway that is critical for remodeling the secretory response of granule.
