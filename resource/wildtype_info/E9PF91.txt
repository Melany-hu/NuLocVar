UniprotID	E9PF91
Accession	E9PF91
EntryName	E9PF91_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sperm acrosome membrane-associated protein 3
GeneName	SPACA3
Length	112
Function	Sperm surface membrane protein that may be involved in sperm-egg plasma membrane adhesion and fusion during fertilization. It could be a potential receptor for the egg oligosaccharide residue N-acetylglucosamine, which is present in the extracellular matrix over the egg plasma membrane. The processed form has no detectable bacteriolytic activity in vitro.
