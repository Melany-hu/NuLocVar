UniprotID	O00168
Accession	O00168;A8K196
EntryName	PLM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholemman (FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 1) (Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit FXYD1)
GeneName	FXYD1 PLM
Length	92
Function	Associates with and regulates the activity of the sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase (NKA) which transports Na(+) out of the cell and K(+) into the cell. Inhibits NKA activity in its unphosphorylated state and stimulates activity when phosphorylated. Reduces glutathionylation of the NKA beta-1 subunit ATP1B1, thus reversing glutathionylation-mediated inhibition of ATP1B1. Contributes to female sexual development by maintaining the excitability of neurons which secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
