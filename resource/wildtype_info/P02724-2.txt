UniprotID	P02724-2
Accession	P02724;A0A0C4DFT7;A8K3E6;B8Q182;B8Q185;Q9BS51
EntryName	GLPA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycophorin-A (MN sialoglycoprotein) (PAS-2) (Sialoglycoprotein alpha) (CD antigen CD235a)
GeneName	GYPA GPA MNS
Length	124
Function	Component of the ankyrin-1 complex, a multiprotein complex involved in the stability and shape of the erythrocyte membrane (PubMed:35835865). Glycophorin A is the major intrinsic membrane protein of the erythrocyte. The N-terminal glycosylated segment, which lies outside the erythrocyte membrane, has MN blood group receptors. Appears to be important for the function of SLC4A1 and is required for high activity of SLC4A1. May be involved in translocation of SLC4A1 to the plasma membrane.
