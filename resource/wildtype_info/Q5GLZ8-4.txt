UniprotID	Q5GLZ8-4
Accession	Q5GLZ8;Q5GC98;Q5GC99;Q5GCA0;Q8IXP9;Q9HCH9
EntryName	HERC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase HERC4 (EC 2.3.2.26) (HECT domain and RCC1-like domain-containing protein 4) (HECT-type E3 ubiquitin transferase HERC4)
GeneName	HERC4 KIAA1593
Length	110
Function	Probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase involved in either protein trafficking or in the distribution of cellular structures. Required for spermatozoon maturation and fertility, and for the removal of the cytoplasmic droplet of the spermatozoon. E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases accept ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester and then directly transfer it to targeted substrates.
