UniprotID	O43920
Accession	O43920
EntryName	NDUS5_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 5 (Complex I-15 kDa) (CI-15 kDa) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 15 kDa subunit)
GeneName	NDUFS5
Length	106
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Mitochondrion intermembrane space
