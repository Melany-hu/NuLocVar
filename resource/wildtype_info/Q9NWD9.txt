UniprotID	Q9NWD9
Accession	Q9NWD9
EntryName	BEX4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein BEX4 (BEX1-like protein 1) (Brain-expressed X-linked protein 4) (Nerve growth factor receptor-associated protein 3)
GeneName	BEX4 BEXL1 NADE3
Length	120
Function	May play a role in microtubule deacetylation by negatively regulating the SIRT2 deacetylase activity toward alpha-tubulin and thereby participate in the control of cell cycle progression and genomic stability (PubMed:27512957). In absence of reductive stress, acts as a pseudosubstrate for the CRL2(FEM1B) complex: associates with FEM1B via zinc, thereby preventing association between FEM1B and its substrates (By similarity).
