UniprotID	Q9NVJ2
Accession	Q9NVJ2;B4DI85
EntryName	ARL8B_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 8B (EC 3.6.5.2) (ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 10C) (Novel small G protein indispensable for equal chromosome segregation 1)
GeneName	ARL8B ARL10C GIE1
Length	186
Function	Small GTPase which cycles between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states (PubMed:15331635, PubMed:16537643). In its active state, binds to a variety of effector proteins playing a key role in the regulation of lysosomal positioning which is important for nutrient sensing, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antigen presentation. Along with its effectors, orchestrates lysosomal transport and fusion (PubMed:16537643, PubMed:16650381, PubMed:25898167, PubMed:27808481, PubMed:28325809). Localizes specifically to lysosomal membranes and mediates anterograde lysosomal motility by recruiting PLEKHM2, which in turn recruits the motor protein kinesin-1 on lysosomes. Required for lysosomal and cytolytic granule exocytosis (PubMed:22172677, PubMed:24088571, PubMed:29592961). Critical factor involved in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Drives the polarization of cytolytic granules and microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) toward the immune synapse between effector NK lymphocytes and target cells (PubMed:24088571). In neurons, mediates the anterograde axonal long-range transport of presynaptic lysosome-related vesicles required for presynaptic biogenesis and synaptic function (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of endosome to lysosome trafficking pathways of special significance for host defense (PubMed:21802320). Recruits RUFY1 onto early endosomes regulating endosomes to trans-Golgi network proteins retrieval (PubMed:36282215). Regulates cargo trafficking to lysosomes by binding to PLEKHM1 and recruiting the HOPS subunit VPS41, resulting in functional assembly of the HOPS complex on lysosomal membranes (PubMed:16537643, PubMed:25908847). Plays an important role in cargo delivery to lysosomes for antigen presentation and microbial killing. Directs the intersection of CD1d with lipid antigens in lysosomes, and plays a role in intersecting phagosomes with lysosomes to generate phagolysosomes that kill microbes (PubMed:21802320, PubMed:25908847). Involved in the process of MHC II presentation. Regulates the delivery of antigens to lysosomes and the formation of MHC II-peptide complexes through the recruitment of the HOPS complex to lysosomes allowing the fusion of late endosomes to lysosomes (By similarity). May play a role in chromosome segregation (PubMed:15331635).
