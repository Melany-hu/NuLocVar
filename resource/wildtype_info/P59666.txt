UniprotID	P59666
Accession	P59666;P11479;Q14125
EntryName	DEF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neutrophil defensin 3 (Defensin, alpha 3) (HNP-3) (HP-3) (HP3) [Cleaved into: HP 3-56; Neutrophil defensin 2 (HNP-2) (HP-2) (HP2)]
GeneName	DEFA3 DEF3
Length	94
Function	Effector molecule of the innate immune system that acts via antibiotic-like properties against a broad array of infectious agents including bacteria, fungi, and viruses (PubMed:15616305, PubMed:15772169, PubMed:17142766). Possesses the ability to neutralize bacterial toxins such as B.anthracis lethal factor, Clostridium difficile cytotoxin B as well as leukocidin produced by Staphylococcus aureus (PubMed:15772169, PubMed:18435932, PubMed:25963798). Also blocks herpes simplex virus infection by interacting with envelope glycoprotein B and thus preventing its binding to heparan sulfate, the receptor for attachment (PubMed:17142766).
