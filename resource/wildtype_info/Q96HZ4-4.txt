UniprotID	Q96HZ4-4
Accession	Q96HZ4;A8KAP6;B8ZZA9;Q53SN9;Q8N2J2;Q96T93;Q9P2S3
EntryName	HES6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription cofactor HES-6 (C-HAIRY1) (Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 41) (bHLHb41) (Hairy and enhancer of split 6)
GeneName	HES6 BHLHB41
Length	112
Function	Does not bind DNA itself but suppresses both HES1-mediated N box-dependent transcriptional repression and binding of HES1 to E box sequences. Also suppresses HES1-mediated inhibition of the heterodimer formed by ASCL1/MASH1 and TCF3/E47, allowing ASCL1 and TCF3 to up-regulate transcription in its presence. Promotes cell differentiation (By similarity).
