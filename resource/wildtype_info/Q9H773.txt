UniprotID	Q9H773
Accession	Q9H773
EntryName	DCTP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	dCTP pyrophosphatase 1 (EC 3.6.1.12) (Deoxycytidine-triphosphatase 1) (dCTPase 1) (RS21C6) (XTP3-transactivated gene A protein)
GeneName	DCTPP1 XTP3TPA CDA03
Length	170
Function	Hydrolyzes deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates. Has a strong preference for dCTP and its analogs including 5-iodo-dCTP and 5-methyl-dCTP for which it may even have a higher efficiency. May protect DNA or RNA against the incorporation of these genotoxic nucleotide analogs through their catabolism.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cytosol
