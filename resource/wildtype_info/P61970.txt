UniprotID	P61970
Accession	P61970;B2R4G7;P13662;Q6IB67
EntryName	NTF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF-2) (Placental protein 15) (PP15)
GeneName	NUTF2 NTF2
Length	127
Function	Mediates the import of GDP-bound RAN from the cytoplasm into the nucleus which is essential for the function of RAN in cargo receptor-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport. Thereby, plays indirectly a more general role in cargo receptor-mediated nucleocytoplasmic transport. Interacts with GDP-bound RAN in the cytosol, recruits it to the nuclear pore complex via its interaction with nucleoporins and promotes its nuclear import.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Nucleus outer membrane; Nucleus; Nuclear pore complex; Nucleus inner membrane; Nucleus; Nucleoplasm
