EntryName	BAX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Apoptosis regulator BAX (Bcl-2-like protein 4) (Bcl2-L-4)
GeneName	BAX BCL2L4
Length	114
Function	Plays a role in the mitochondrial apoptotic process (PubMed:10772918, PubMed:11060313, PubMed:16113678, PubMed:16199525, PubMed:18948948, PubMed:21199865, PubMed:21458670, PubMed:25609812, PubMed:36361894, PubMed:8358790, PubMed:8521816). Under normal conditions, BAX is largely cytosolic via constant retrotranslocation from mitochondria to the cytosol mediated by BCL2L1/Bcl-xL, which avoids accumulation of toxic BAX levels at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) (PubMed:21458670). Under stress conditions, undergoes a conformation change that causes translocation to the mitochondrion membrane, leading to the release of cytochrome c that then triggers apoptosis (PubMed:10772918, PubMed:11060313, PubMed:16113678, PubMed:16199525, PubMed:18948948, PubMed:21199865, PubMed:21458670, PubMed:25609812, PubMed:8358790, PubMed:8521816). Promotes activation of CASP3, and thereby apoptosis (PubMed:10772918, PubMed:11060313, PubMed:16113678, PubMed:16199525, PubMed:18948948, PubMed:21199865, PubMed:21458670, PubMed:25609812, PubMed:8358790, PubMed:8521816).
