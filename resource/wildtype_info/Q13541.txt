UniprotID	Q13541
Accession	Q13541;B2R502;D3DSW8;Q6IBN3
EntryName	4EBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (eIF4E-binding protein 1) (Phosphorylated heat- and acid-stable protein regulated by insulin 1) (PHAS-I)
GeneName	EIF4EBP1
Length	118
Function	Repressor of translation initiation that regulates EIF4E activity by preventing its assembly into the eIF4F complex: hypophosphorylated form competes with EIF4G1/EIF4G3 and strongly binds to EIF4E, leading to repress translation. In contrast, hyperphosphorylated form dissociates from EIF4E, allowing interaction between EIF4G1/EIF4G3 and EIF4E, leading to initiation of translation. Mediates the regulation of protein translation by hormones, growth factors and other stimuli that signal through the MAP kinase and mTORC1 pathways.
