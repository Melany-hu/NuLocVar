EntryName	THMS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein THEMIS2 (Induced by contact to basement membrane 1 protein) (Protein ICB-1) (Thymocyte-expressed molecule involved in selection protein 2)
GeneName	THEMIS2 C1orf38 ICB1
Length	123
Function	May constitute a control point in macrophage inflammatory response, promoting LPS-induced TLR4-mediated TNF production (PubMed:20644716). Determines the threshold for activation of B cells by low-affinity and low-avidity ligands via PLCG2 activation and its downstream pathways (By similarity).
