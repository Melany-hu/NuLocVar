UniprotID	Q16514
Accession	Q16514;D3DPM5;Q15775;Q5T077
EntryName	TAF12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 12 (Transcription initiation factor TFIID 20/15 kDa subunits) (TAFII-20/TAFII-15) (TAFII20/TAFII15)
GeneName	TAF12 TAF15 TAF2J TAFII20
Length	161
Function	The TFIID basal transcription factor complex plays a major role in the initiation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription (PubMed:33795473). TFIID recognizes and binds promoters with or without a TATA box via its subunit TBP, a TATA-box-binding protein, and promotes assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (PubMed:33795473). The TFIID complex consists of TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), including TAF1, TAF2, TAF3, TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF7, TAF8, TAF9, TAF10, TAF11, TAF12 and TAF13 (PubMed:33795473). Component of the TATA-binding protein-free TAF complex (TFTC), the PCAF histone acetylase complex and the STAGA transcription coactivator-HAT complex (PubMed:10373431, PubMed:7729427, PubMed:8598932, PubMed:8663456, PubMed:9674425, PubMed:9885574).
