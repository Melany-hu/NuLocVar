UniprotID	O15347
Accession	O15347;O95556;Q6NS40
EntryName	HMGB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	High mobility group protein B3 (High mobility group protein 2a) (HMG-2a) (High mobility group protein 4) (HMG-4)
GeneName	HMGB3 HMG2A HMG4
Length	200
Function	Multifunctional protein with various roles in different cellular compartments. May act in a redox sensitive manner. Associates with chromatin and binds DNA with a preference for non-canonical DNA structures such as single-stranded DNA. Can bend DNA and enhance DNA flexibility by looping thus providing a mechanism to promote activities on various gene promoters (By similarity). Proposed to be involved in the innate immune response to nucleic acids by acting as a cytoplasmic promiscuous immunogenic DNA/RNA sensor (By similarity). Negatively regulates B-cell and myeloid cell differentiation. In hematopoietic stem cells may regulate the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Involved in negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling (By similarity).
