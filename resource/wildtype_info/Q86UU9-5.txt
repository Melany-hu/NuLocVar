UniprotID	Q86UU9-5
Accession	Q86UU9;Q2M2P1;Q6ECK8;Q86UU6;Q86UU7;Q86UU8;Q8IWZ7
EntryName	TKN4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tachykinin-4 (Preprotachykinin-C) (PPT-C) [Cleaved into: Endokinin-A (EKA); Endokinin-A/B (EKA/B); Endokinin-C (EKC)]
GeneName	TAC4
Length	107
Function	Tachykinins are active peptides which excite neurons, evoke behavioral responses, are potent vasodilators and secretagogues, and contract (directly or indirectly) many smooth muscles. Endokinin-A induces thermal hyperalgesia and pain-related behavior such as scratching following intrathecal administration in rats. These effects are suppressed by treatment with endokinin-C. Endokinin-A/B reduces arterial blood pressure and increases sperm motility.
