UniprotID	C9JJT5
Accession	C9JJT5
EntryName	C9JJT5_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP synthase subunit f, mitochondrial (ATP synthase membrane subunit f)
GeneName	ATP5MF-PTCD1
Length	54
Function	Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. Part of the complex F(0) domain. Minor subunit located with subunit a in the membrane.
