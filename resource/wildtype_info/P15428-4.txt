Accession	P15428;B4DTA4;B4DU74;B4DV57;D3DP43;E7EV11;O00749;Q06F08;Q12998
EntryName	PGDH_HUMAN
ProteinName	15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase [NAD(+)] (15-PGDH) (EC 1.1.1.141) (Eicosanoid/docosanoid dehydrogenase [NAD(+)]) (EC 1.1.1.-, EC 1.1.1.232) (Prostaglandin dehydrogenase 1) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 36C member 1)
GeneName	HPGD PGDH1 SDR36C1
Length	143
Function	Catalyzes the NAD-dependent dehydrogenation (oxidation) of a broad array of hydroxylated polyunsaturated fatty acids (mainly eicosanoids and docosanoids, including prostaglandins, lipoxins and resolvins), yielding their corresponding keto (oxo) metabolites (PubMed:10837478, PubMed:16757471, PubMed:16828555, PubMed:21916491, PubMed:25586183, PubMed:8086429). Decreases the levels of the pro-proliferative prostaglandins such as prostaglandin E2 (whose activity is increased in cancer because of an increase in the expression of cyclooxygenase 2) and generates oxo-fatty acid products that can profoundly influence cell function by abrogating pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (PubMed:15574495, PubMed:25586183). Converts resolvins E1, D1 and D2 to their oxo products, which represents a mode of resolvin inactivation. Resolvin E1 plays important roles during the resolution phase of acute inflammation, while resolvins D1 and D2 have a unique role in obesity-induced adipose inflammation (PubMed:16757471, PubMed:22844113).
