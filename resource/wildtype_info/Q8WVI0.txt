UniprotID	Q8WVI0
Accession	Q8WVI0
EntryName	UQCC5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor 5 (Small integral membrane protein 4)
GeneName	UQCC5 C3orf78 SMIM4
Length	70
Function	Required for the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (complex III (CIII) or cytochrome b-c1 complex), a multisubunit transmembrane complex that is part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) which drives oxidative phosphorylation (By similarity). Mediates early complex III biogenesis (By similarity). Participates in regulating the levels of electron transport chain proteins, and therefore energy supply, in response to changes in energy demand (By similarity). Also involved in the first steps of cytochrome c oxidase complex (complex IV) assembly (PubMed:34969438).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
