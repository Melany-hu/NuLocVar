Accession	Q15714;A0A087X0H8;B3KRL7;B9EGI0;O00666;Q6AHX5;Q6IBU1;Q8NCN1;Q96JS5
EntryName	T22D1_HUMAN
ProteinName	TSC22 domain family protein 1 (Cerebral protein 2) (HUCEP-2) (Regulatory protein TSC-22) (TGFB-stimulated clone 22 homolog) (Transforming growth factor beta-1-induced transcript 4 protein)
GeneName	TSC22D1 KIAA1994 TGFB1I4 TSC22 hucep-2
Length	86
Function	Transcriptional repressor (PubMed:10488076). Acts on the C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) promoter (PubMed:9022669). Acts to promote CASP3-mediated apoptosis (PubMed:18325344). Positively regulates TGF-beta signaling by interacting with SMAD7 which inhibits binding of SMAD7 to TGFBR1, preventing recruitment of SMURF ubiquitin ligases to TGFBR1 and inhibiting SMURF-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of TGFBR1 (PubMed:21791611). Contributes to enhancement of TGF-beta signaling by binding to and modulating the transcription activator activity of SMAD4 (PubMed:15881652). Promotes TGF-beta-induced transcription of COL1A2; via its interaction with TFE3 at E-boxes in the gene proximal promoter (By similarity). Plays a role in the repression of hematopoietic precursor cell growth (By similarity). Promotes IL2 deprivation-induced apoptosis in T-lymphocytes, via repression of TSC22D3/GILZ transcription and activation of the caspase cascade (PubMed:26752201).
