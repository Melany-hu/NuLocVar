UniprotID	A0A3B3IU63
Accession	A0A3B3IU63
EntryName	H2AL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A-like 3 (H2A.L.3)
GeneName	H2AL3 H2AL1RP
Length	148
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
