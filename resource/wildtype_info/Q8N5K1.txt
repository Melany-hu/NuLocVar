UniprotID	Q8N5K1
Accession	Q8N5K1;Q7Z3D5
EntryName	CISD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	CDGSH iron-sulfur domain-containing protein 2 (Endoplasmic reticulum intermembrane small protein) (MitoNEET-related 1 protein) (Miner1) (Nutrient-deprivation autophagy factor-1) (NAF-1)
GeneName	CISD2 CDGSH2 ERIS ZCD2
Length	135
Function	Regulator of autophagy that contributes to antagonize BECN1-mediated cellular autophagy at the endoplasmic reticulum. Participates in the interaction of BCL2 with BECN1 and is required for BCL2-mediated depression of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores during autophagy. Contributes to BIK-initiated autophagy, while it is not involved in BIK-dependent activation of caspases. Involved in life span control, probably via its function as regulator of autophagy.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Mitochondrion outer membrane
