UniprotID	Q13367-2
Accession	Q13367;A4Z4T7;B7ZKR7;B7ZKS0;O14808;Q52LY8
EntryName	AP3B2_HUMAN
ProteinName	AP-3 complex subunit beta-2 (Adaptor protein complex AP-3 subunit beta-2) (Adaptor-related protein complex 3 subunit beta-2) (Beta-3B-adaptin) (Clathrin assembly protein complex 3 beta-2 large chain) (Neuron-specific vesicle coat protein beta-NAP)
GeneName	AP3B2
Length	145
Function	Subunit of non-clathrin- and clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) that plays a role in protein sorting in the late-Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN) and/or endosomes. The AP complexes mediate both the recruitment of clathrin to membranes and the recognition of sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-3 appears to be involved in the sorting of a subset of transmembrane proteins targeted to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles. In concert with the BLOC-1 complex, AP-3 is required to target cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane; Golgi apparatus
