UniprotID	Q16661
Accession	Q16661;Q52LV0
EntryName	GUC2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanylate cyclase activator 2B [Cleaved into: Guanylate cyclase C-activating peptide 2 (Guanylate cyclase C-activating peptide II) (GCAP-II); Uroguanylin (UGN)]
GeneName	GUCA2B
Length	112
Function	Endogenous activator of intestinal guanylate cyclase. It stimulates this enzyme through the same receptor binding region as the heat-stable enterotoxins. May be a potent physiological regulator of intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport. May be an autocrine/paracrine regulator of intestinal salt and water transport.
