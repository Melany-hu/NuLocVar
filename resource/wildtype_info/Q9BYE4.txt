UniprotID	Q9BYE4
Accession	Q9BYE4
EntryName	SPR2G_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small proline-rich protein 2G (SPR-2G)
GeneName	SPRR2G
Length	73
Function	Cross-linked envelope protein of keratinocytes. It is a keratinocyte protein that first appears in the cell cytosol, but ultimately becomes cross-linked to membrane proteins by transglutaminase. All that results in the formation of an insoluble envelope beneath the plasma membrane (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
