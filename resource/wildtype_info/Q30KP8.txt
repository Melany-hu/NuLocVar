UniprotID	Q30KP8
Accession	Q30KP8;Q4QY36
EntryName	DB136_HUMAN
ProteinName	Defensin beta 136 (Beta-defensin 136) (DEFB137)
GeneName	DEFB136
Length	78
Function	Host defense peptide that exhibits antibacterial and antifungal activity (PubMed:34481960). Exhibits antimicrobial activity against E.coli, S.aureus and C.albicans (in vitro) (PubMed:34481960). Has high lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding affinity, and may thereby be involved in immunoregulation through LPS neutralization (PubMed:34481960).
