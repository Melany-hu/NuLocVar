UniprotID	Q7L1S5-2
Accession	Q7L1S5;Q6UX69;Q9BXH3;Q9BXH4;Q9BZW9
EntryName	CHST9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 9 (EC 2.8.2.-) (GalNAc-4-O-sulfotransferase 2) (GalNAc-4-ST2) (GalNAc4ST-2) (N-acetylgalactosamine-4-O-sulfotransferase 2)
GeneName	CHST9 UNQ2549/PRO6175
Length	74
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of sulfate to position 4 of non-reducing N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues in both N-glycans and O-glycans. Participates in biosynthesis of glycoprotein hormones lutropin and thyrotropin, by mediating sulfation of their carbohydrate structures. Has a higher activity toward carbonic anhydrase VI than toward lutropin. Only active against terminal GalNAcbeta1,GalNAcbeta. Isoform 2, but not isoform 1, is active toward chondroitin.
