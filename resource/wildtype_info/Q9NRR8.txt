UniprotID	Q9NRR8
Accession	Q9NRR8;D3DV12;Q9HB17;Q9NQR2
EntryName	C42S1_HUMAN
ProteinName	CDC42 small effector protein 1 (CDC42-binding protein SCIP1) (Small effector of CDC42 protein 1)
GeneName	CDC42SE1 SPEC1
Length	79
Function	Probably involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton by acting downstream of CDC42, inducing actin filament assembly. Alters CDC42-induced cell shape changes. In activated T-cells, may play a role in CDC42-mediated F-actin accumulation at the immunological synapse. May play a role in early contractile events in phagocytosis in macrophages.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cell membrane
