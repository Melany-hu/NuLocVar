UniprotID	A6NHK2
Accession	A6NHK2
EntryName	A6NHK2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein E (snRNP-E) (Sm protein E)
GeneName	SNRPE
Length	52
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing as a core component of the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome. Component of both the pre-catalytic spliceosome B complex and activated spliceosome C complexes. As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs. As part of the U7 snRNP it is involved in histone 3'-end processing.
