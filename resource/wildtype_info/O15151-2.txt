UniprotID	O15151-2
Accession	O15151;Q2M2Y2;Q32SL2;Q6GS18;Q8IV83
EntryName	MDM4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Mdm4 (Double minute 4 protein) (Mdm2-like p53-binding protein) (Protein Mdmx) (p53-binding protein Mdm4)
GeneName	MDM4 MDMX
Length	127
Function	Along with MDM2, contributes to TP53 regulation (PubMed:32300648). Inhibits p53/TP53- and TP73/p73-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by binding its transcriptional activation domain. Inhibits degradation of MDM2. Can reverse MDM2-targeted degradation of TP53 while maintaining suppression of TP53 transactivation and apoptotic functions.
