Accession	A4FU57
EntryName	A4FU57_HUMAN
ProteinName	KRTAP19-6 protein
GeneName	KRTAP19-6
Length	76
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
