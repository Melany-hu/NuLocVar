UniprotID	P60328
Accession	P60328
EntryName	KR123_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 12-3 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 12.3) (Keratin-associated protein 12.3)
GeneName	KRTAP12-3 KAP12.3 KRTAP12.3
Length	96
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
