EntryName	UXT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein UXT (Androgen receptor trapped clone 27 protein) (ART-27) (Ubiquitously expressed transcript protein)
GeneName	UXT HSPC024
Length	157
Function	Involved in gene transcription regulation (PubMed:21730289, PubMed:28106301). Acts in concert with the corepressor URI1 to regulate androgen receptor AR-mediated transcription (PubMed:11854421, PubMed:21730289). Together with URI1, associates with chromatin to the NKX3-1 promoter region (PubMed:21730289). Negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor ESR1 by inducing its translocation into the cytoplasm (PubMed:28106301). May act as nuclear chaperone that facilitates the formation of the NF-kappa-B enhanceosome and thus positively regulates NF-kappa-B transcription activity (PubMed:17620405, PubMed:21307340). Potential component of mitochondrial-associated LRPPRC, a multidomain organizer that potentially integrates mitochondria and the microtubular cytoskeleton with chromosome remodeling (PubMed:17554592). Increasing concentrations of UXT contributes to progressive aggregation of mitochondria and cell death potentially through its association with LRPPRC (PubMed:17554592). Suppresses cell transformation and it might mediate this function by interaction and inhibition of the biological activity of cell proliferation and survival stimulatory factors like MECOM (PubMed:17635584).
