UniprotID	Q9BRA2
Accession	Q9BRA2;A8K7E8
EntryName	TXD17_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 17 (14 kDa thioredoxin-related protein) (TRP14) (Protein 42-9-9) (Thioredoxin-like protein 5)
GeneName	TXNDC17 TXNL5
Length	123
Function	Disulfide reductase. May participate in various redox reactions through the reversible oxidation of its active center dithiol to a disulfide and catalyze dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions. Modulates TNF-alpha signaling and NF-kappa-B activation. Has peroxidase activity and may contribute to the elimination of cellular hydrogen peroxide.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
