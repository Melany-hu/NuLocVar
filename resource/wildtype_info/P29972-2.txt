EntryName	AQP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) (Aquaporin-CHIP) (Channel-like integral membrane protein of 28 kDa) (Urine water channel)
GeneName	AQP1 CHIP28
Length	186
Function	Forms a water channel that facilitates the transport of water across cell membranes, playing a crucial role in water homeostasis in various tissues (PubMed:1373524, PubMed:23219802). Could also be permeable to small solutes including hydrogen peroxide, glycerol and gases such as amonnia (NH3), nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) (PubMed:16682607, PubMed:17012249, PubMed:19273840, PubMed:33028705, PubMed:8584435). Recruited to the ankyrin-1 complex, a multiprotein complex of the erythrocyte membrane, it could be part of a CO2 metabolon, linking facilitated diffusion of CO2 across the membrane, anion exchange of Cl(-)/HCO3(-) and interconversion of dissolved CO2 and carbonic acid in the cytosol (PubMed:17012249, PubMed:35835865). In vitro, it shows non-selective gated cation channel activity and may be permeable to cations like K(+) and Na(+) in vivo (PubMed:36949749, PubMed:8703053).
