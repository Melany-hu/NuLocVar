UniprotID	P12838
Accession	P12838;Q6EZF8
EntryName	DEF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Defensin alpha 4 (Corticostatin HP-4) (HNP-4) (HP-4) (Neutrophil defensin 4)
GeneName	DEFA4 DEF4
Length	97
Function	Host-defense peptide that has antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, and to a lesser extent also against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi (PubMed:15317502, PubMed:15616305, PubMed:2500436, PubMed:2501794, PubMed:30658057). Exhibits antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative E.coli and E.aerogenes and Gram-positive S.faecalis, S.aureus and B.cereus and the yeast C.albicans (in vitro) (PubMed:15317502, PubMed:15616305, PubMed:17088326, PubMed:2500436, PubMed:2501794, PubMed:30658057). Interacts with pathogenic surface proteins and toxins, such as HIV-1 surface protein gp120 and B.anthracis anthrax lethal factor lef (PubMed:15620707, PubMed:30658057). Protects blood cells against infection with HIV-1 (in vitro) (PubMed:15620707). Inhibits enzymatic activity of B.anthracis lef/anthrax lethal factor (in vitro) (PubMed:30658057). Inhibits corticotropin (ACTH)-stimulated corticosterone production (in vitro) (PubMed:2843187).
