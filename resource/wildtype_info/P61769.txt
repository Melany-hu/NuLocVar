UniprotID	P61769
Accession	P61769;P01884;Q540F8;Q6IAT8;Q9UCK0;Q9UD48;Q9UDF4
EntryName	B2MG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-2-microglobulin [Cleaved into: Beta-2-microglobulin form pI 5.3]
GeneName	B2M CDABP0092 HDCMA22P
Length	119
Function	Component of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Involved in the presentation of peptide antigens to the immune system. Exogenously applied M.tuberculosis EsxA or EsxA-EsxB (or EsxA expressed in host) binds B2M and decreases its export to the cell surface (total protein levels do not change), probably leading to defects in class I antigen presentation (PubMed:25356553).
