UniprotID	A6BM72-4
Accession	A6BM72;Q17R86;Q6UXS5;Q8ND91;Q96KG6
EntryName	MEG11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Multiple epidermal growth factor-like domains protein 11 (Multiple EGF-like domains protein 11)
GeneName	MEGF11 KIAA1781 UNQ1949/PRO4432
Length	137
Function	May regulate the mosaic spacing of specific neuron subtypes in the retina through homotypic retinal neuron repulsion. Mosaics provide a mechanism to distribute each cell type evenly across the retina, ensuring that all parts of the visual field have access to a full set of processing elements (By similarity).
