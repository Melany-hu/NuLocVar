UniprotID	Q96G61
Accession	Q96G61;Q9NVN0
EntryName	NUD11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase 3-beta (DIPP-3-beta) (DIPP3-beta) (hDIPP3beta) (EC 3.6.1.52) (Diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P6-hexaphosphate hydrolase 3-beta) (Diadenosine hexaphosphate hydrolase (AMP-forming)) (EC 3.6.1.60) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 11) (Nudix motif 11) (hAps1)
GeneName	NUDT11 APS1 DIPP3B
Length	164
Function	Cleaves a beta-phosphate from the diphosphate groups in PP-InsP5 (diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate), suggesting that it may play a role in signal transduction. Also able to catalyze the hydrolysis of dinucleoside oligophosphates, with Ap6A and Ap5A being the preferred substrates. The major reaction products are ADP and p4a from Ap6A and ADP and ATP from Ap5A. Also able to hydrolyze 5-phosphoribose 1-diphosphate.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
