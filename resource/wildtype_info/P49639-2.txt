UniprotID	P49639-2
Accession	P49639;A0A2R8Y4R9;A4D184;B2R8U7;O43363
EntryName	HXA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein Hox-A1 (Homeobox protein Hox-1F)
GeneName	HOXA1 HOX1F
Length	137
Function	Sequence-specific transcription factor (By similarity). Regulates multiple developmental processes including brainstem, inner and outer ear, abducens nerve and cardiovascular development and morphogenesis as well as cognition and behavior (PubMed:16155570). Also part of a developmental regulatory system that provides cells with specific positional identities on the anterior-posterior axis. Acts on the anterior body structures. Seems to act in the maintenance and/or generation of hindbrain segments (By similarity). Activates transcription in the presence of PBX1A and PKNOX1 (By similarity).
