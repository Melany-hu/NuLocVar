UniprotID	P62314
Accession	P62314;B5BTZ1;P13641
EntryName	SMD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein Sm D1 (Sm-D1) (Sm-D autoantigen) (snRNP core protein D1)
GeneName	SNRPD1
Length	119
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing as a core component of the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:18984161, PubMed:19325628, PubMed:23333303, PubMed:25555158, PubMed:26912367, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:28781166, PubMed:32494006). Component of both the pre-catalytic spliceosome B complex and activated spliceosome C complexes (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:26912367, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:28781166). As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (PubMed:15146077). May act as a charged protein scaffold to promote snRNP assembly or strengthen snRNP-snRNP interactions through non-specific electrostatic contacts with RNA (PubMed:23333303).
