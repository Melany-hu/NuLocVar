UniprotID	Q96A98
Accession	Q96A98;Q96DJ4
EntryName	TIP39_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tuberoinfundibular peptide of 39 residues (TIP39) (Parathyroid hormone 2)
GeneName	PTH2 TIP39 TIPF39
Length	100
Function	Plays a role as a potent and selective agonist of PTH2R resulting in adenyl cyclase activation and intracellular calcium levels elevation. Induces protein kinase C beta activation, recruitment of beta-arrestin and PTH2R internalization. May inhibit cell proliferation via its action on PTH2R activation. Neuropeptide which may also have a role in spermatogenesis. May activate nociceptors and nociceptive circuits.
