UniprotID	Q9P2P5-2
Accession	Q9P2P5;B8ZZB4;Q17RT5;Q68DF8;Q9NPS9
EntryName	HECW2_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase HECW2 (EC 2.3.2.26) (HECT, C2 and WW domain-containing protein 2) (HECT-type E3 ubiquitin transferase HECW2) (NEDD4-like E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase 2)
GeneName	HECW2 KIAA1301 NEDL2
Length	82
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates ubiquitination of TP73. Acts to stabilize TP73 and enhance activation of transcription by TP73 (PubMed:12890487). Involved in the regulation of mitotic metaphase/anaphase transition (PubMed:24163370).
