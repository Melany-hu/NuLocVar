UniprotID	A8MZB2
Accession	A8MZB2
EntryName	A8MZB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-alpha-acetyltransferase 20 (EC 2.3.1.254) (Methionine N-acetyltransferase) (N-acetyltransferase 5) (N-terminal acetyltransferase B complex catalytic subunit NAA20) (N-terminal acetyltransferase B complex catalytic subunit NAT5) (NatB catalytic subunit)
GeneName	NAA20 NAT5 hCG_21103
Length	166
Function	Catalytic subunit of the NatB complex which catalyzes acetylation of the N-terminal methionine residues of peptides beginning with Met-Asp, Met-Glu, Met-Asn and Met-Gln. Proteins with cell cycle functions are overrepresented in the pool of NatB substrates. Required for maintaining the structure and function of actomyosin fibers and for proper cellular migration.
