UniprotID	O00585
Accession	O00585;Q6ICR7
EntryName	CCL21_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 21 (6Ckine) (Beta-chemokine exodus-2) (Secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine) (SLC) (Small-inducible cytokine A21)
GeneName	CCL21 SCYA21 UNQ784/PRO1600
Length	134
Function	Inhibits hemopoiesis and stimulates chemotaxis. Chemotactic in vitro for thymocytes and activated T-cells, but not for B-cells, macrophages, or neutrophils. Shows preferential activity towards naive T-cells. May play a role in mediating homing of lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid organs. Binds to atypical chemokine receptor ACKR4 and mediates the recruitment of beta-arrestin (ARRB1/2) to ACKR4.
