UniprotID	Q6IPL9
Accession	Q6IPL9
EntryName	Q6IPL9_HUMAN
ProteinName	High mobility group protein HMG-I/HMG-Y (High mobility group AT-hook protein 1)
GeneName	HMGA1
Length	107
Function	HMG-I/Y bind preferentially to the minor groove of A+T rich regions in double-stranded DNA. It is suggested that these proteins could function in nucleosome phasing and in the 3'-end processing of mRNA transcripts. They are also involved in the transcription regulation of genes containing, or in close proximity to A+T-rich regions.
