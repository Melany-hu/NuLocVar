UniprotID	Q8WV07
Accession	Q8WV07;B2R4R2;Q8NFK0
EntryName	LTO1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein LTO1 homolog (Oral cancer-overexpressed protein 1) (Tumor-amplified and overexpressed sequence 1)
GeneName	LTO1 ORAOV1 TAOS1
Length	137
Function	The complex LTO1:YAE1 functions as a target specific adapter that probably recruits apo-ABCE1 to the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) complex machinery (PubMed:26182403). May be required for biogenesis of the large ribosomal subunit and initiation of translation (PubMed:23318452). May play a role in the regulation of proline metabolism and ROS production (PubMed:24930674).
