UniprotID	O75348
Accession	O75348;Q6IB33
EntryName	VATG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit G 1 (V-ATPase subunit G 1) (V-ATPase 13 kDa subunit 1) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit G 1) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit M16)
GeneName	ATP6V1G1 ATP6G ATP6G1 ATP6J
Length	118
Function	Subunit of the V1 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons (PubMed:32001091, PubMed:33065002). V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment (PubMed:32001091). In aerobic conditions, involved in intracellular iron homeostasis, thus triggering the activity of Fe(2+) prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes, and leading to HIF1A hydroxylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:28296633).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane
