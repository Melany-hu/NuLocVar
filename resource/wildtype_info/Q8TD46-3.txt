UniprotID	Q8TD46-3
Accession	Q8TD46;B3KWZ9;E9PCM9;Q52LJ7;Q6IS95;Q6UW94;Q6WHB8;Q8TD44;Q8TD45;Q8TD52
EntryName	MO2R1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cell surface glycoprotein CD200 receptor 1 (CD200 cell surface glycoprotein receptor) (Cell surface glycoprotein OX2 receptor 1)
GeneName	CD200R1 CD200R CRTR2 MOX2R OX2R UNQ2522/PRO6015
Length	165
Function	Inhibitory receptor for the CD200/OX2 cell surface glycoprotein. Limits inflammation by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules including TNF-alpha, interferons, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in response to selected stimuli. Also binds to HHV-8 K14 viral CD200 homolog with identical affinity and kinetics as the host CD200.
