UniprotID	P25063
Accession	P25063;A0A087WYI6;B6EC88;Q16257;Q53XS0;R4I4T5
EntryName	CD24_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal transducer CD24 (Small cell lung carcinoma cluster 4 antigen) (CD antigen CD24)
GeneName	CD24 CD24A
Length	80
Function	May have a pivotal role in cell differentiation of different cell types. Signaling could be triggered by the binding of a lectin-like ligand to the CD24 carbohydrates, and transduced by the release of second messengers derived from the GPI-anchor. Modulates B-cell activation responses. Promotes AG-dependent proliferation of B-cells, and prevents their terminal differentiation into antibody-forming cells (PubMed:11313396). In association with SIGLEC10 may be involved in the selective suppression of the immune response to danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as HMGB1, HSP70 and HSP90. Plays a role in the control of autoimmunity (By similarity).
