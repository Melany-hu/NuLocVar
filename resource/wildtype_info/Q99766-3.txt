UniprotID	Q99766-3
Accession	Q99766;A0A2R8YDJ1;A0A5K1VW60;A8K1U3;D9N156;Q8WWX3;Q96F77
EntryName	ATP5S_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP synthase subunit s, mitochondrial (ATP synthase-coupling factor B) (FB) (Distal membrane arm assembly complex 2-like protein) (Mitochondrial ATP synthase regulatory component factor B)
GeneName	DMAC2L ATP5S ATPW
Length	112
Function	Involved in regulation of mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase. Necessary for H(+) conduction of ATP synthase. Facilitates energy-driven catalysis of ATP synthesis by blocking a proton leak through an alternative proton exit pathway.
