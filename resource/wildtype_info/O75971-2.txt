UniprotID	O75971-2
Accession	O75971;A8K7N6;Q96CF3
EntryName	SNPC5_HUMAN
ProteinName	snRNA-activating protein complex subunit 5 (SNAPc subunit 5) (Small nuclear RNA-activating complex polypeptide 5) (snRNA-activating protein complex 19 kDa subunit) (SNAPc 19 kDa subunit)
GeneName	SNAPC5 SNAP19
Length	68
Function	Part of the SNAPc complex required for the transcription of both RNA polymerase II and III small-nuclear RNA genes. Binds to the proximal sequence element (PSE), a non-TATA-box basal promoter element common to these 2 types of genes. Recruits TBP and BRF2 to the U6 snRNA TATA box.
