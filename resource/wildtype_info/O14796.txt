ProteinName	SH2 domain-containing protein 1B (EWS/FLI1-activated transcript 2) (EAT-2)
GeneName	SH2D1B EAT2
Length	132
Function	Cytoplasmic adapter regulating receptors of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family such as CD84, SLAMF1, LY9 and CD244 (PubMed:11689425). In SLAM signaling seems to cooperate with SH2D1A/SAP. Plays a role in regulation of effector functions of natural killer (NK) cells by controlling signal transduction through CD244/2B4 without effecting its tyrosine phosphorylation; downstream signaling involves PLCG1 and ERK activation (PubMed:24687958). Activation of SLAMF7-mediated NK cell function does not effect receptor tyrosine phosphorylation but distal signaling (By similarity). In the context of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity does not enhance conjugate formation with target cells but stimulates polarization of the microtubule-organizing center and cytotoxic granules toward the NK cell synapse (PubMed:24687958). Negatively regulates CD40-induced cytokine production in dendritic cells downstream of SLAM family receptors probably by inducing activation of the PI3K pathway to inhibit p38 MAPK and JNK activation (By similarity).
