UniprotID	Q9UK76-3
Accession	Q9UK76;B2R6K3;Q53FG7;Q7Z2D2;Q7Z2F0
EntryName	JUPI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Jupiter microtubule associated homolog 1 (Androgen-regulated protein 2) (Hematological and neurological expressed 1 protein) [Cleaved into: Jupiter microtubule associated homolog 1, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	JPT1 ARM2 HN1
Length	108
Function	Modulates negatively AKT-mediated GSK3B signaling (PubMed:21323578, PubMed:22155408). Induces CTNNB1 'Ser-33' phosphorylation and degradation through the suppression of the inhibitory 'Ser-9' phosphorylation of GSK3B, which represses the function of the APC:CTNNB1:GSK3B complex and the interaction with CDH1/E-cadherin in adherent junctions (PubMed:25169422). Plays a role in the regulation of cell cycle and cell adhesion (PubMed:25169422, PubMed:25450365). Has an inhibitory role on AR-signaling pathway through the induction of receptor proteasomal degradation (PubMed:22155408).
