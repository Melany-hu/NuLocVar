UniprotID	P59665
Accession	P59665;P11479;Q14125;Q6EZF6
EntryName	DEF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neutrophil defensin 1 (Defensin, alpha 1) (HNP-1) (HP-1) (HP1) [Cleaved into: HP 1-56; Neutrophil defensin 2 (HNP-2) (HP-2) (HP2)]
GeneName	DEFA1 DEF1 DEFA2 MRS; DEFA1B
Length	94
Function	Effector molecule of the innate immune system that acts via antibiotic-like properties against a broad array of infectious agents including bacteria, fungi, and viruses or by promoting the activation and maturation of some APCs (PubMed:15616305, PubMed:17142766, PubMed:20220136, PubMed:24236072). Interacts with the essential precursor of cell wall synthesis lipid II to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis (PubMed:20214904). Inhibits adenovirus infection via inhibition of viral disassembly at the vertex region, thereby restricting the release of internal capsid protein pVI, which is required for endosomal membrane penetration during cell entry (PubMed:18191790). In addition, interaction with adenovirus capsid leads to the redirection of viral particles to TLR4 thereby promoting a NLRP3-mediated inflammasome response and interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta) release (PubMed:35080426). Induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines including type I interferon (IFN) in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) by triggering the degradation of NFKBIA and nuclear translocation of IRF1, both of which are required for activation of pDCs (PubMed:27031443).
