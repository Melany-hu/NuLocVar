UniprotID	Q9Y5J5
Accession	Q9Y5J5;B2R5A4;Q53HD6;Q8NBW9
EntryName	PHLA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 3 (TDAG51/Ipl homolog 1)
GeneName	PHLDA3 TIH1
Length	127
Function	p53/TP53-regulated repressor of Akt/AKT1 signaling. Represses AKT1 by preventing AKT1-binding to membrane lipids, thereby inhibiting AKT1 translocation to the cellular membrane and activation. Contributes to p53/TP53-dependent apoptosis by repressing AKT1 activity. Its direct transcription regulation by p53/TP53 may explain how p53/TP53 can negatively regulate AKT1. May act as a tumor suppressor.
