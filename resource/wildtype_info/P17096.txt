UniprotID	P17096
Accession	P17096;P10910;Q5T6U9;Q9UKB0
EntryName	HMGA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	High mobility group protein HMG-I/HMG-Y (HMG-I(Y)) (High mobility group AT-hook protein 1) (High mobility group protein A1) (High mobility group protein R)
GeneName	HMGA1 HMGIY
Length	107
Function	HMG-I/Y bind preferentially to the minor groove of A+T rich regions in double-stranded DNA. It is suggested that these proteins could function in nucleosome phasing and in the 3'-end processing of mRNA transcripts. They are also involved in the transcription regulation of genes containing, or in close proximity to A+T-rich regions.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
