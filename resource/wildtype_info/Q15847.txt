UniprotID	Q15847
Accession	Q15847
EntryName	ADIRF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adipogenesis regulatory factor (Adipogenesis factor rich in obesity) (Adipose most abundant gene transcript 2 protein) (Adipose-specific protein 2) (apM-2)
GeneName	ADIRF AFRO APM2 C10orf116
Length	76
Function	Plays a role in fat cell development; promotes adipogenic differentiation and stimulates transcription initiation of master adipogenesis factors like PPARG and CEBPA at early stages of preadipocyte differentiation. Its overexpression confers resistance to the anticancer chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin.
