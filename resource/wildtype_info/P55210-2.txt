EntryName	CASP7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caspase-7 (CASP-7) (EC 3.4.22.60) (Apoptotic protease Mch-3) (CMH-1) (ICE-like apoptotic protease 3) (ICE-LAP3) [Cleaved into: Caspase-7 subunit p20; Caspase-7 subunit p11]
GeneName	CASP7 MCH3
Length	253
Function	Thiol protease involved in different programmed cell death processes, such as apoptosis, pyroptosis or granzyme-mediated programmed cell death, by proteolytically cleaving target proteins (PubMed:11257230, PubMed:11257231, PubMed:11701129, PubMed:15314233, PubMed:16916640, PubMed:17646170, PubMed:18723680, PubMed:19581639, PubMed:8521391, PubMed:8567622, PubMed:8576161, PubMed:9070923). Has a marked preference for Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) consensus sequences, with some plasticity for alternate non-canonical sequences (PubMed:12824163, PubMed:15314233, PubMed:17697120, PubMed:19581639, PubMed:20566630, PubMed:23650375, PubMed:23897474, PubMed:27032039). Its involvement in the different programmed cell death processes is probably determined by upstream proteases that activate CASP7 (By similarity). Acts as an effector caspase involved in the execution phase of apoptosis: following cleavage and activation by initiator caspases (CASP8, CASP9 and/or CASP10), mediates execution of apoptosis by catalyzing cleavage of proteins, such as CLSPN, PARP1, PTGES3 and YY1 (PubMed:10497198, PubMed:16123041, PubMed:16374543, PubMed:16916640, PubMed:18723680, PubMed:20566630, PubMed:21555521, PubMed:22184066, PubMed:22451931, PubMed:27889207, PubMed:28863261, PubMed:31586028, PubMed:34156061, PubMed:35338844, PubMed:35446120). Compared to CASP3, acts as a minor executioner caspase and cleaves a limited set of target proteins (PubMed:18723680). Acts as a key regulator of the inflammatory response in response to bacterial infection by catalyzing cleavage and activation of the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase SMPD1 in the extracellular milieu, thereby promoting membrane repair (PubMed:21157428). Regulates pyroptosis in intestinal epithelial cells: cleaved and activated by CASP1 in response to S.typhimurium infection, promoting its secretion to the extracellular milieu, where it catalyzes activation of SMPD1, generating ceramides that repair membranes and counteract the action of gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pores (By similarity). Regulates granzyme-mediated programmed cell death in hepatocytes: cleaved and activated by granzyme B (GZMB) in response to bacterial infection, promoting its secretion to the extracellular milieu, where it catalyzes activation of SMPD1, generating ceramides that repair membranes and counteract the action of perforin (PRF1) pores (By similarity). Following cleavage by CASP1 in response to inflammasome activation, catalyzes processing and inactivation of PARP1, alleviating the transcription repressor activity of PARP1 (PubMed:22464733). Acts as an inhibitor of type I interferon production during virus-induced apoptosis by mediating cleavage of antiviral proteins CGAS, IRF3 and MAVS, thereby preventing cytokine overproduction (By similarity). Cleaves and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) (PubMed:8643593). Cleaves phospholipid scramblase proteins XKR4, XKR8 and XKR9 (By similarity). In case of infection, catalyzes cleavage of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus protein ORF57, thereby preventing expression of viral lytic genes (PubMed:20159985). Cleaves BIRC6 following inhibition of BIRC6-caspase binding by DIABLO/SMAC (PubMed:36758104, PubMed:36758106).
