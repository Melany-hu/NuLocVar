UniprotID	O00626
Accession	O00626;A0N0Q6;B2R4W2
EntryName	CCL22_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 22 (CC chemokine STCP-1) (MDC(1-69)) (Macrophage-derived chemokine) (Small-inducible cytokine A22) (Stimulated T-cell chemotactic protein 1) [Cleaved into: MDC(3-69); MDC(5-69); MDC(7-69)]
GeneName	CCL22 MDC SCYA22 A-152E5.1
Length	93
Function	May play a role in the trafficking of activated/effector T-lymphocytes to inflammatory sites and other aspects of activated T-lymphocyte physiology. Chemotactic for monocytes, dendritic cells and natural killer cells. Mild chemoattractant for primary activated T-lymphocytes and a potent chemoattractant for chronically activated T-lymphocytes but has no chemoattractant activity for neutrophils, eosinophils, and resting T-lymphocytes. Binds to CCR4. Processed forms MDC(3-69), MDC(5-69) and MDC(7-69) seem not be active.
