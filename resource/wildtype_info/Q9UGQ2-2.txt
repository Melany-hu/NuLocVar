ProteinName	Calcium channel flower homolog (Calcium channel flower domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	CACFD1 C9orf7 PSEC0107 PSEC0248 UNQ3071/PRO9903
Length	130
Function	Transmembrane protein which mediates synaptic endocytosis and fitness-based cell culling (PubMed:31341286, PubMed:37348560). In response to different stimulus strengths, controls two major modes of synaptic vesicle (SV) retrieval in hippocampal neurons; Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in response to mild stimulation and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) in response to strong stimulation (By similarity). In cytotoxic T-lymphoocytes (CTLs) facilitates calcium-dependent endocytosis of cytotoxic granules at the immuno synapse (By similarity). Different isoforms work as fitness fingerprints in 'loser' and 'winner' cells and thereby mediate win/lose decisions as part of the cell competition process (PubMed:31341286).
