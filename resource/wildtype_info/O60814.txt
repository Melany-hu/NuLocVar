UniprotID	O60814
Accession	O60814;A8K7P7;Q2VPI7
EntryName	H2B1K_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type 1-K (H2B K) (HIRA-interacting protein 1)
GeneName	H2BC12 H2BFT HIRIP1 HIST1H2BK
Length	126
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
