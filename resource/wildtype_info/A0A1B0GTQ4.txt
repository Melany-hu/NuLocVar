UniprotID	A0A1B0GTQ4
Accession	A0A1B0GTQ4;A0A223PZB9
EntryName	MYMX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein myomixer (Microprotein inducer of fusion) (Protein minion) (hMINION)
GeneName	MYMX
Length	84
Function	Myoblast-specific protein that mediates myoblast fusion, an essential step for the formation of multi-nucleated muscle fibers (PubMed:28569745, PubMed:35642635). Involved in membrane fusion downstream of the lipid mixing step mediated by MYMK (By similarity). Acts by generating membrane stresses via its extracellular C-terminus, leading to drive fusion pore formation. Acts independently of MYMK (By similarity). Involved in skeletal muscle regeneration in response to injury by mediating the fusion of satellite cells, a population of muscle stem cells, with injured myofibers (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
