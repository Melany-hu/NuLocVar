UniprotID	Q9HC16-3
Accession	Q9HC16;B2RDR9;Q45F02;Q5TF77;Q7Z2N1;Q7Z2N4;Q9H9H8
EntryName	ABC3G_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA dC->dU-editing enzyme APOBEC-3G (EC 3.5.4.38) (APOBEC-related cytidine deaminase) (APOBEC-related protein) (ARCD) (APOBEC-related protein 9) (ARP-9) (CEM-15) (CEM15) (Deoxycytidine deaminase) (A3G)
GeneName	APOBEC3G MDS019
Length	79
Function	DNA deaminase (cytidine deaminase) which acts as an inhibitor of retrovirus replication and retrotransposon mobility via deaminase-dependent and -independent mechanisms (PubMed:12808465, PubMed:16527742, PubMed:17121840, PubMed:18288108, PubMed:18849968, PubMed:19153609, PubMed:21123384, PubMed:22791714, PubMed:25542899). Exhibits potent antiviral activity against Vif-deficient HIV-1 (PubMed:12167863, PubMed:12859895, PubMed:14557625, PubMed:20219927, PubMed:21835787, PubMed:22807680, PubMed:22915799, PubMed:23097438, PubMed:23152537, PubMed:31397674). After the penetration of retroviral nucleocapsids into target cells of infection and the initiation of reverse transcription, it can induce the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the minus-sense single-strand viral DNA, leading to G-to-A hypermutations in the subsequent plus-strand viral DNA (PubMed:12808465, PubMed:12808466, PubMed:12809610, PubMed:12970355, PubMed:14528300, PubMed:22807680). The resultant detrimental levels of mutations in the proviral genome, along with a deamination-independent mechanism that works prior to the proviral integration, together exert efficient antiretroviral effects in infected target cells (PubMed:12808465, PubMed:12808466, PubMed:12809610, PubMed:12970355, PubMed:14528300). Selectively targets single-stranded DNA and does not deaminate double-stranded DNA or single- or double-stranded RNA (PubMed:12808465, PubMed:12809610, PubMed:12970355, PubMed:14528300). Exhibits antiviral activity also against simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), hepatitis B virus (HBV), equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), xenotropic MuLV-related virus (XMRV) and simian foamy virus (SFV) (PubMed:15031497, PubMed:16378963, PubMed:18448976, PubMed:19458006, PubMed:20335265). May inhibit the mobility of LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons (PubMed:16527742).
