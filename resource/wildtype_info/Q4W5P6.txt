UniprotID	Q4W5P6
Accession	Q4W5P6;A0A2R8YEN4;D3DNW9;Q96NI2
EntryName	SIM43_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small integral membrane protein 43 (Nodal enhanced mesendoderm micropeptide) (NEMEP)
GeneName	SMIM43 TMEM155
Length	63
Function	Required for mesendoderm differentiation (By similarity). Interacts with glucose transporters and promotes glucose uptake (PubMed:35810171). Probably augments the glucose uptake capacity of glucose transporter proteins to meet the energy needs of mesendoderm differentiation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
