EntryName	UB2D3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D3 (EC 2.3.2.23) ((E3-independent) E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme D3) (EC 2.3.2.24) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme D3) (Ubiquitin carrier protein D3) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2(17)KB 3) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-17 kDa 3) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase D3)
GeneName	UBE2D3 UBC5C UBCH5C
Length	149
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins (PubMed:15247280, PubMed:15496420, PubMed:18284575, PubMed:20061386, PubMed:21532592, PubMed:28322253). In vitro catalyzes 'Lys-11'-, as well as 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:15247280, PubMed:15496420, PubMed:18284575, PubMed:20061386, PubMed:21532592). Cooperates with the E2 CDC34 and the SCF(FBXW11) E3 ligase complex for the polyubiquitination of NFKBIA leading to its subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:20347421). Acts as an initiator E2, priming the phosphorylated NFKBIA target at positions 'Lys-21' and/or 'Lys-22' with a monoubiquitin (PubMed:10329681). Ubiquitin chain elongation is then performed by CDC34, building ubiquitin chains from the UBE2D3-primed NFKBIA-linked ubiquitin (PubMed:10329681). Also acts as an initiator E2, in conjunction with RNF8, for the priming of PCNA (PubMed:18948756). Monoubiquitination of PCNA, and its subsequent polyubiquitination, are essential events in the operation of the DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathway that is activated after DNA damage caused by UV or chemical agents during S-phase (PubMed:18948756). Associates with the BRCA1/BARD1 E3 ligase complex to perform ubiquitination at DNA damage sites following ionizing radiation leading to DNA repair (PubMed:16628214). Targets DAPK3 for ubiquitination which influences promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear body (PML-NB) formation in the nucleus (PubMed:18515077). In conjunction with the MDM2 and TOPORS E3 ligases, functions ubiquitination of p53/TP53 (PubMed:12646252, PubMed:15280377). In conjunction with the CBL E3 ligase, targets EGFR for polyubiquitination at the plasma membrane as well as during its internalization and transport on endosomes (PubMed:18508924). In conjunction with the STUB1 E3 quality control E3 ligase, ubiquitinates unfolded proteins to catalyze their immediate destruction (PubMed:11743028). Together with RNF135, catalyzes the viral RNA-dependent 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIGI to activate the downstream signaling pathway that leads to interferon beta production (PubMed:28469175). Together with ZNF598, catalyzes ubiquitination of 40S ribosomal proteins in response to ribosome collisions (PubMed:28685749). In cooperation with the GATOR2 complex, catalyzes 'Lys-6'-linked ubiquitination of NPRL2 (PubMed:36528027).
