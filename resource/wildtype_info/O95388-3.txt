UniprotID	O95388-3
Accession	O95388;A8KAG6;E7EMM5;Q5JBS6;Q5JBS7;Q5JBS8;Q9HCS3
EntryName	CCN4_HUMAN
ProteinName	CCN family member 4 (WNT1-inducible-signaling pathway protein 1) (WISP-1) (Wnt-1-induced secreted protein)
GeneName	CCN4 WISP1
Length	122
Function	Downstream regulator in the Wnt/Frizzled-signaling pathway. Associated with cell survival. Attenuates p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage through activation of AKT kinase. Up-regulates the anti-apoptotic Bcl-X(L) protein. Adheres to skin and melanoma fibroblasts. In vitro binding to skin fibroblasts occurs through the proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan.
