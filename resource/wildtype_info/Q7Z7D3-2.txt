UniprotID	Q7Z7D3-2
Accession	Q7Z7D3;Q0GN76;Q45VN0;Q5WPZ3;Q6P097;Q9H6B2
EntryName	VTCN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-set domain-containing T-cell activation inhibitor 1 (B7 homolog 4) (B7-H4) (B7h.5) (Immune costimulatory protein B7-H4) (Protein B7S1) (T-cell costimulatory molecule B7x)
GeneName	VTCN1 B7H4 UNQ659/PRO1291
Length	166
Function	Negatively regulates T-cell-mediated immune response by inhibiting T-cell activation, proliferation, cytokine production and development of cytotoxicity. When expressed on the cell surface of tumor macrophages, plays an important role, together with regulatory T-cells (Treg), in the suppression of tumor-associated antigen-specific T-cell immunity. Involved in promoting epithelial cell transformation.
