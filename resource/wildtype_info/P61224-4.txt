EntryName	RAP1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rap-1b (EC 3.6.5.2) (GTP-binding protein smg p21B)
GeneName	RAP1B OK/SW-cl.11
Length	142
Function	GTP-binding protein that possesses intrinsic GTPase activity. Contributes to the polarizing activity of KRIT1 and CDH5 in the establishment and maintenance of correct endothelial cell polarity and vascular lumen. Required for the localization of phosphorylated PRKCZ, PARD3 and TIAM1 to the cell junction. Plays a role in the establishment of basal endothelial barrier function.
