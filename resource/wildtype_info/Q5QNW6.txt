UniprotID	Q5QNW6
Accession	Q5QNW6;A8K0U9;B4DLA9
EntryName	H2B2F_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type 2-F (H2B-clustered histone 18)
GeneName	H2BC18 HIST2H2BF
Length	126
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
