EntryName	GHRL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Appetite-regulating hormone (Growth hormone secretagogue) (Growth hormone-releasing peptide) (Motilin-related peptide) (Protein M46) [Cleaved into: Ghrelin-27; Ghrelin-28 (Ghrelin); Obestatin]
GeneName	GHRL MTLRP UNQ524/PRO1066
Length	66
Function	Ghrelin is the ligand for growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1 (GHSR) (PubMed:10604470). Induces the release of growth hormone from the pituitary (PubMed:10604470).
