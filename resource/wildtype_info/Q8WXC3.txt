UniprotID	Q8WXC3
Accession	Q8WXC3;B2R8L4;Q8NFP8
EntryName	PYDC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pyrin domain-containing protein 1 (PAAD-only protein 1) (Pyrin-only protein 1) (cellular POP1) (cPOP1)
GeneName	PYDC1 ASC2 ASCI POP1 PYC1
Length	89
Function	Associates with PYCARD/ASC and modulates its ability to collaborate with MEFV/pyrin and NLRP3/cryopyrin in NF-kappa-B and pro-caspase-1 activation. Suppresses kinase activity of NF-kappa-B inhibitor kinase (IKK) complex, expression of NF-kappa-B inducible genes and inhibits NF-kappa-B activation by cytokines and LPS.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
