UniprotID	P55197-2
Accession	P55197;B1ANA8;Q5JT37;Q5VX90;Q66K63
EntryName	AF10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein AF-10 (ALL1-fused gene from chromosome 10 protein)
GeneName	MLLT10 AF10
Length	126
Function	Probably involved in transcriptional regulation. In vitro or as fusion protein with KMT2A/MLL1 has transactivation activity. Binds to cruciform DNA. In cells, binding to unmodified histone H3 regulates DOT1L functions including histone H3 'Lys-79' dimethylation (H3K79me2) and gene activation (PubMed:26439302).
