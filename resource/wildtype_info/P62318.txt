UniprotID	P62318
Accession	P62318;B4DJP7;B5BU13;P43331
EntryName	SMD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein Sm D3 (Sm-D3) (snRNP core protein D3)
GeneName	SNRPD3
Length	126
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing as a core component of the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:18984161, PubMed:19325628, PubMed:25555158, PubMed:26912367, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:28781166, PubMed:32494006). Component of both the pre-catalytic spliceosome B complex and activated spliceosome C complexes (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:28781166). As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (PubMed:15146077, PubMed:33509932). As part of the U7 snRNP it is involved in histone pre-mRNA 3'-end processing (By similarity).
