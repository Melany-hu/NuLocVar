UniprotID	Q9UKG9-2
Accession	Q9UKG9;A4D1D6;E7EQF2;Q86V17;Q8IUW9;Q9Y6I2
EntryName	OCTC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisomal carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (COT) (EC 2.3.1.137)
GeneName	CROT COT
Length	87
Function	Beta-oxidation of fatty acids. The highest activity concerns the C6 to C10 chain length substrate. Converts the end product of pristanic acid beta oxidation, 4,8-dimethylnonanoyl-CoA, to its corresponding carnitine ester.
