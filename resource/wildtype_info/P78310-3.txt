Accession	P78310;B2R8V8;B7WPI3;D3YHP0;O00694;Q8WWT6;Q8WWT7;Q8WWT8;Q9UKV4
EntryName	CXAR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) (hCAR) (CVB3-binding protein) (Coxsackievirus B-adenovirus receptor) (HCVADR)
GeneName	CXADR CAR
Length	89
Function	Component of the epithelial apical junction complex that may function as a homophilic cell adhesion molecule and is essential for tight junction integrity. Also involved in transepithelial migration of leukocytes through adhesive interactions with JAML a transmembrane protein of the plasma membrane of leukocytes. The interaction between both receptors also mediates the activation of gamma-delta T-cells, a subpopulation of T-cells residing in epithelia and involved in tissue homeostasis and repair. Upon epithelial CXADR-binding, JAML induces downstream cell signaling events in gamma-delta T-cells through PI3-kinase and MAP kinases. It results in proliferation and production of cytokines and growth factors by T-cells that in turn stimulate epithelial tissues repair.
