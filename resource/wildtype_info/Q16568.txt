UniprotID	Q16568
Accession	Q16568;Q6FG92
EntryName	CART_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript protein [Cleaved into: CART(1-39); CART(42-89)]
GeneName	CARTPT CART
Length	116
Function	Satiety factor closely associated with the actions of leptin and neuropeptide Y; this anorectic peptide inhibits both normal and starvation-induced feeding and completely blocks the feeding response induced by neuropeptide Y and regulated by leptin in the hypothalamus. It promotes neuronal development and survival in vitro.
