EntryName	TRPM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 1 (Long transient receptor potential channel 1) (LTrpC1) (Melastatin-1)
GeneName	TRPM1 LTRPC1 MLSN MLSN1
Length	136
Function	Constitutively open nonselective divalent cation-conducting channels which mediate the influx of Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Mn(2+), Ba(2+), and Ni(2+) into the cytoplasm, leading to membrane depolarization (PubMed:11535825, PubMed:19436059, PubMed:21278253). Impermeable to zinc ions (PubMed:21278253). In addition, forms heteromultimeric ion channels with TRPM3 which are permeable for calcium and zinc ions (PubMed:21278253). Plays an essential role for the depolarizing photoresponse of retinal ON bipolar cells (PubMed:19878917, PubMed:19896109). In the dark, tonic release of glutamate activates the G-protein coupled receptor for glutamate, GRM6, its activation induces the release of G(o) protein and the beta-gamma G protein dimer. Both subunits can interact and inactivate the TRPM1 channel. A light onset, induces decrease in glutamate release and deactivation of GRM6 leading to channel opening and membrane depolarization (By similarity). May play a role in metastasis suppression (PubMed:9537257).
