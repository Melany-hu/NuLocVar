EntryName	ABCB5_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 5 (ABCB5 P-gp) (P-glycoprotein ABCB5) (EC 7.6.2.2)
GeneName	ABCB5
Length	131
Function	Energy-dependent efflux transporter responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells (PubMed:12960149, PubMed:15205344, PubMed:15899824, PubMed:22306008). Specifically present in limbal stem cells, where it plays a key role in corneal development and repair (By similarity).
