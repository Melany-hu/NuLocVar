UniprotID	K7ERG4
Accession	K7ERG4
EntryName	K7ERG4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein Sm D2 (Sm-D2) (snRNP core protein D2)
GeneName	SNRPD2
Length	78
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing as a core component of the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome. Component of both the pre-catalytic spliceosome B complex and activated spliceosome C complexes. As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs.
