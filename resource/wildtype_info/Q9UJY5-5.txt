EntryName	GGA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor-binding protein GGA1 (Gamma-adaptin-related protein 1) (Golgi-localized, gamma ear-containing, ARF-binding protein 1)
GeneName	GGA1
Length	89
Function	Plays a role in protein sorting and trafficking between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. Mediates the ARF-dependent recruitment of clathrin to the TGN and binds ubiquitinated proteins and membrane cargo molecules with a cytosolic acidic cluster-dileucine (DXXLL) motif (PubMed:11301005, PubMed:15886016). Mediates export of the GPCR receptor ADRA2B to the cell surface (PubMed:27901063). Required for targeting PKD1:PKD2 complex from the trans-Golgi network to the cilium membrane (By similarity). Regulates retrograde transport of proteins such as phosphorylated form of BACE1 from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (PubMed:15615712, PubMed:15886016).
