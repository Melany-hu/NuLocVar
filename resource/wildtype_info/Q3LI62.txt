UniprotID	Q3LI62
Accession	Q3LI62
EntryName	KR204_HUMAN
ProteinName	Putative keratin-associated protein 20-4
GeneName	KRTAP20-4 KAP20.4
Length	44
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins (By similarity).
