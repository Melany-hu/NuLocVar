Accession	Q9NSK0;B3KNY4;B3KPI3;B3KSQ3;B4DME9;Q66K28;Q96EG6
EntryName	KLC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kinesin light chain 4 (KLC 4) (Kinesin-like protein 8)
GeneName	KLC4 KNSL8
Length	131
Function	Kinesin is a microtubule-associated force-producing protein that may play a role in organelle transport. The light chain may function in coupling of cargo to the heavy chain or in the modulation of its ATPase activity (By similarity).
