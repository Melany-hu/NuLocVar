Accession	P51878;B4DKP5;Q0QVY7;Q0QVY8;Q0QVZ0;Q0QVZ1;Q0QVZ2;Q14DD6;Q1HBJ3;Q6DJV7
EntryName	CASP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caspase-5 (CASP-5) (EC 3.4.22.58) (ICE(rel)-III) (Protease ICH-3) (Protease TY) [Cleaved into: Caspase-5 subunit p20; Caspase-5 subunit p10]
GeneName	CASP5 ICH3
Length	108
Function	Thiol protease that acts as a mediator of programmed cell death (PubMed:28314590, PubMed:29898893). Initiates pyroptosis, a programmed lytic cell death pathway through cleavage of Gasdermin-D (GSDMD): cleavage releases the N-terminal gasdermin moiety (Gasdermin-D, N-terminal) that binds to membranes and forms pores, triggering pyroptosis (PubMed:29898893). Also mediates cleavage and maturation of IL18 (PubMed:37993714). Cleavage of GSDMD and IL18 is not strictly dependent on the consensus cleavage site but depends on an exosite interface on CASP4 (PubMed:37993714). During non-canonical inflammasome activation, cuts CGAS and may play a role in the regulation of antiviral innate immune activation (PubMed:28314590).
