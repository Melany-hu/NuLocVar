UniprotID	Q9Y4F1-3
Accession	Q9Y4F1;Q5JVI9;Q6IQ29
EntryName	FARP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	FERM, ARHGEF and pleckstrin domain-containing protein 1 (Chondrocyte-derived ezrin-like protein) (FERM, RhoGEF and pleckstrin domain-containing protein 1) (Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family C member 2) (PH domain-containing family C member 2)
GeneName	FARP1 CDEP PLEKHC2
Length	129
Function	Functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAC1. May play a role in semaphorin signaling. Plays a role in the assembly and disassembly of dendritic filopodia, the formation of dendritic spines, regulation of dendrite length and ultimately the formation of synapses (By similarity).
