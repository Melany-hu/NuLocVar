EntryName	ID1_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-binding protein inhibitor ID-1 (Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 24) (bHLHb24) (Inhibitor of DNA binding 1) (Inhibitor of differentiation 1)
GeneName	ID1 BHLHB24 ID
Length	155
Function	Transcriptional regulator (lacking a basic DNA binding domain) which negatively regulates the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors by forming heterodimers and inhibiting their DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Implicated in regulating a variety of cellular processes, including cellular growth, senescence, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and neoplastic transformation. Inhibits skeletal muscle and cardiac myocyte differentiation. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer (By similarity).
