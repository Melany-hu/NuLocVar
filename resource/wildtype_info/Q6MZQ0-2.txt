UniprotID	Q6MZQ0-2
Accession	Q6MZQ0;A4QN22;E9PKY1;Q96H46;Q9H7V4
EntryName	PRR5L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proline-rich protein 5-like (Protein observed with Rictor-2) (Protor-2)
GeneName	PRR5L PROTOR2
Length	139
Function	Associates with the mTORC2 complex that regulates cellular processes including survival and organization of the cytoskeleton (PubMed:17461779). Regulates the activity of the mTORC2 complex in a substrate-specific manner preventing for instance the specific phosphorylation of PKCs and thereby controlling cell migration (PubMed:22609986). Plays a role in the stimulation of ZFP36-mediated mRNA decay of several ZFP36-associated mRNAs, such as TNF-alpha and GM-CSF, in response to stress (PubMed:21964062). Required for ZFP36 localization to cytoplasmic stress granule (SG) and P-body (PB) in response to stress (PubMed:21964062).
