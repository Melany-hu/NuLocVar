UniprotID	Q9BYR8
Accession	Q9BYR8;Q14DM4
EntryName	KRA31_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 3-1 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 3.1) (Keratin-associated protein 3.1)
GeneName	KRTAP3-1 KAP3.1 KRTAP3.1
Length	98
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
