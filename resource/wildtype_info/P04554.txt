UniprotID	P04554
Accession	P04554;Q6ZMM0
EntryName	PRM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protamine-2 (Sperm histone P2) (Sperm protamine P2) [Cleaved into: Basic nuclear protein HPI1; Basic nuclear protein HPI2; Basic nuclear protein HPS1; Basic nuclear protein HPS2; Sperm histone HP4 (Sperm protamine P4); Sperm histone HP2 (Sperm protamine P2) (P2'); Sperm histone HP3 (P2'') (Sperm protamine P3)]
GeneName	PRM2
Length	102
Function	Protamines substitute for histones in the chromatin of sperm during the haploid phase of spermatogenesis. They compact sperm DNA into a highly condensed, stable and inactive complex.
