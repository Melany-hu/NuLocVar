UniprotID	Q5VTU8
Accession	Q5VTU8
EntryName	AT5EL_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP synthase subunit epsilon-like protein, mitochondrial (ATP synthase F1 subunit epsilon pseudogene 2)
GeneName	ATP5F1EP2 ATP5EP2
Length	51
Function	Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. Part of the complex F(1) domain and of the central stalk which is part of the complex rotary element. Rotation of the central stalk against the surrounding alpha(3)beta(3) subunits leads to hydrolysis of ATP in three separate catalytic sites on the beta subunits (By similarity).
