Accession	P09455;A8K2Q0;B7Z7A0;E7EWV0;F2Z2F2;Q6FGX8
EntryName	RET1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinol-binding protein 1 (Cellular retinol-binding protein) (CRBP) (Cellular retinol-binding protein I) (CRBP-I)
GeneName	RBP1 CRBP1
Length	135
Function	Cytoplasmic retinol-binding protein (PubMed:22665496, PubMed:26900151, PubMed:28057518). Accepts retinol from the transport protein STRA6, and thereby contributes to retinol uptake, storage and retinoid homeostasis (PubMed:15632377, PubMed:22665496).
