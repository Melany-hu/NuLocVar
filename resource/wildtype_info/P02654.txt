UniprotID	P02654
Accession	P02654;B2R526;Q6IB97
EntryName	APOC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Apolipoprotein C-I (Apo-CI) (ApoC-I) (Apolipoprotein C1) [Cleaved into: Truncated apolipoprotein C-I]
GeneName	APOC1
Length	83
Function	Inhibitor of lipoprotein binding to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, LDL receptor-related protein, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor. Associates with high density lipoproteins (HDL) and the triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins in the plasma and makes up about 10% of the protein of the VLDL and 2% of that of HDL. Appears to interfere directly with fatty acid uptake and is also the major plasma inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). Binds free fatty acids and reduces their intracellular esterification. Modulates the interaction of APOE with beta-migrating VLDL and inhibits binding of beta-VLDL to the LDL receptor-related protein.
