EntryName	CD1E_HUMAN
ProteinName	T-cell surface glycoprotein CD1e, membrane-associated (hCD1e) (R2G1) (CD antigen CD1e) [Cleaved into: T-cell surface glycoprotein CD1e, soluble (sCD1e)]
GeneName	CD1E
Length	101
Function	T-cell surface glycoprotein CD1e, soluble binds diacetylated lipids, including phosphatidyl inositides and diacylated sulfoglycolipids, and is required for the presentation of glycolipid antigens on the cell surface. The membrane-associated form is not active.
