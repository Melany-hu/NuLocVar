EntryName	IL18_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Iboctadekin) (Interferon gamma-inducing factor) (IFN-gamma-inducing factor) (Interleukin-1 gamma) (IL-1 gamma)
GeneName	IL18 IGIF IL1F4
Length	193
Function	Pro-inflammatory cytokine primarily involved in epithelial barrier repair, polarized T-helper 1 (Th1) cell and natural killer (NK) cell immune responses (PubMed:10653850). Upon binding to IL18R1 and IL18RAP, forms a signaling ternary complex which activates NF-kappa-B, triggering synthesis of inflammatory mediators (PubMed:14528293, PubMed:25500532, PubMed:37993714). Synergizes with IL12/interleukin-12 to induce IFNG synthesis from T-helper 1 (Th1) cells and natural killer (NK) cells (PubMed:10653850). Involved in transduction of inflammation downstream of pyroptosis: its mature form is specifically released in the extracellular milieu by passing through the gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pore (PubMed:33883744).
