UniprotID	P02655
Accession	P02655;C0JYY4;Q9BS39;Q9UDE3;Q9UNK3
EntryName	APOC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Apolipoprotein C-II (Apo-CII) (ApoC-II) (Apolipoprotein C2) [Cleaved into: Proapolipoprotein C-II (ProapoC-II)]
GeneName	APOC2 APC2
Length	101
Function	Component of chylomicrons, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) in plasma. Plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism as an activator of lipoprotein lipase. Both proapolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein C-II can activate lipoprotein lipase. In normolipidemic individuals, it is mainly distributed in the HDL, whereas in hypertriglyceridemic individuals, predominantly found in the VLDL and LDL.
