EntryName	PHAR4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatase and actin regulator 4
GeneName	PHACTR4 PRO2963
Length	63
Function	Regulator of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) required for neural tube and optic fissure closure, and enteric neural crest cell (ENCCs) migration during development. Acts as an activator of PP1 by interacting with PPP1CA and preventing phosphorylation of PPP1CA at 'Thr-320'. During neural tube closure, localizes to the ventral neural tube and activates PP1, leading to down-regulate cell proliferation within cranial neural tissue and the neural retina. Also acts as a regulator of migration of enteric neural crest cells (ENCCs) by activating PP1, leading to dephosphorylation and subsequent activation of cofilin (COF1 or COF2) and repression of the integrin signaling through the RHO/ROCK pathway (By similarity).
