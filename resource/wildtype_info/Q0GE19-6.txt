EntryName	NTCP7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium/bile acid cotransporter 7 (Na(+)/bile acid cotransporter 7) (Solute carrier family 10 member 7)
GeneName	SLC10A7 C4orf13 P7 PSEC0051
Length	64
Function	Involved in teeth and skeletal development. Has an essential role in the biosynthesis and trafficking of glycosaminoglycans and glycoproteins, to produce a proper functioning extracellular matrix. Required for extracellular matrix mineralization (PubMed:29878199, PubMed:30082715). Also involved in the regulation of cellular calcium homeostasis (PubMed:30082715, PubMed:31191616). Does not show transport activity towards bile acids or steroid sulfates (including taurocholate, cholate, chenodeoxycholate, estrone-3-sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and pregnenolone sulfate).
