UniprotID	O76070
Accession	O76070;O15104;Q96P61
EntryName	SYUG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-synuclein (Breast cancer-specific gene 1 protein) (Persyn) (Synoretin) (SR)
GeneName	SNCG BCSG1 PERSYN PRSN
Length	127
Function	Plays a role in neurofilament network integrity. May be involved in modulating axonal architecture during development and in the adult. In vitro, increases the susceptibility of neurofilament-H to calcium-dependent proteases (By similarity). May also function in modulating the keratin network in skin. Activates the MAPK and Elk-1 signal transduction pathway (By similarity).
