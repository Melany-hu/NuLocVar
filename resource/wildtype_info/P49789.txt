Accession	P49789;A2IAS9;A2IAT0;A2IAT6;A8K1A9;Q45QG9;Q6IU12
EntryName	FHIT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bis(5'-adenosyl)-triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.29) (AP3A hydrolase) (AP3Aase) (Adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidase FHIT) (EC 3.9.1.-) (Adenylylsulfatase) (EC 3.6.2.1) (Adenylylsulfate-ammonia adenylyltransferase) (EC 2.7.7.51) (Diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P3-triphosphate hydrolase) (Dinucleosidetriphosphatase) (Fragile histidine triad protein)
GeneName	FHIT
Length	147
Function	Possesses dinucleoside triphosphate hydrolase activity (PubMed:12574506, PubMed:15182206, PubMed:8794732, PubMed:9323207, PubMed:9543008, PubMed:9576908). Cleaves P(1)-P(3)-bis(5'-adenosyl) triphosphate (Ap3A) to yield AMP and ADP (PubMed:12574506, PubMed:15182206, PubMed:8794732, PubMed:9323207, PubMed:9543008, PubMed:9576908). Can also hydrolyze P(1)-P(4)-bis(5'-adenosyl) tetraphosphate (Ap4A), but has extremely low activity with ATP (PubMed:8794732). Exhibits adenylylsulfatase activity, hydrolyzing adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to yield AMP and sulfate (PubMed:18694747). Exhibits adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidase activity, hydrolyzing purine nucleotide phosphoramidates with a single phosphate group such as adenosine 5'monophosphoramidate (AMP-NH2) to yield AMP and NH2 (PubMed:18694747). Exhibits adenylylsulfate-ammonia adenylyltransferase, catalyzing the ammonolysis of adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate resulting in the formation of adenosine 5'-phosphoramidate (PubMed:26181368). Also catalyzes the ammonolysis of adenosine 5-phosphorofluoridate and diadenosine triphosphate (PubMed:26181368). Modulates transcriptional activation by CTNNB1 and thereby contributes to regulate the expression of genes essential for cell proliferation and survival, such as CCND1 and BIRC5 (PubMed:18077326). Plays a role in the induction of apoptosis via SRC and AKT1 signaling pathways (PubMed:16407838). Inhibits MDM2-mediated proteasomal degradation of p53/TP53 and thereby plays a role in p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis (PubMed:15313915). Induction of apoptosis depends on the ability of FHIT to bind P(1)-P(3)-bis(5'-adenosyl) triphosphate or related compounds, but does not require its catalytic activity, it may in part come from the mitochondrial form, which sensitizes the low-affinity Ca(2+) transporters, enhancing mitochondrial calcium uptake (PubMed:12574506, PubMed:19622739). Functions as a tumor suppressor (By similarity).
