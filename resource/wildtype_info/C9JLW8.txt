UniprotID	C9JLW8
Accession	C9JLW8;Q6ZUL0
EntryName	MCRI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mapk-regulated corepressor-interacting protein 1 (Granulin-2) (Protein FAM195B)
GeneName	MCRIP1 FAM195B GRAN2
Length	97
Function	The phosphorylation status of MCRIP1 functions as a molecular switch to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Unphosphorylated MCRIP1 binds to and inhibits the transcriptional corepressor CTBP(s). When phosphorylated by MAPK/ERK, MCRIP1 releases CTBP(s) resulting in transcriptional silencing of the E-cadherin gene and induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (PubMed:25728771).
