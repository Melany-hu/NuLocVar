UniprotID	Q9P2W3
Accession	Q9P2W3;B2R5C8;Q52LX0;Q9UJJ3
EntryName	GBG13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(O) subunit gamma-13
GeneName	GNG13
Length	67
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
