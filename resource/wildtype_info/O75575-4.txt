Accession	O75575;A8MUZ4;A8MW23;B2R4H4;B4E198;Q3KRA3;Q5HYF1;Q8IXL4
EntryName	RPC9_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC9 (RNA polymerase III subunit C9) (Calcitonin gene-related peptide-receptor component protein) (CGRP-RCP) (CGRP-receptor component protein) (CGRPRCP) (HsC17)
GeneName	CRCP
Length	71
Function	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates (PubMed:20413673, PubMed:33558764, PubMed:34675218). Specific peripheric component of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) which synthesizes small non-coding RNAs including 5S rRNA, snRNAs, tRNAs and miRNAs from at least 500 distinct genomic loci. With POLR3H/RPC8 forms a mobile stalk that protrudes from Pol III core and functions primarily in transcription initiation (By similarity) (PubMed:20413673, PubMed:33558764, PubMed:33558766, PubMed:34675218). Pol III plays a key role in sensing and limiting infection by intracellular bacteria and DNA viruses. Acts as nuclear and cytosolic DNA sensor involved in innate immune response. Can sense non-self dsDNA that serves as template for transcription into dsRNA. The non-self RNA polymerase III transcripts, such as Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNAs (EBERs) induce type I interferon and NF-kappa-B through the RIG-I pathway (PubMed:19609254, PubMed:19631370).
