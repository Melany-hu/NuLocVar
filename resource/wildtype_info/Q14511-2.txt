EntryName	CASL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Enhancer of filamentation 1 (hEF1) (CRK-associated substrate-related protein) (CAS-L) (CasL) (Cas scaffolding protein family member 2) (CASS2) (Neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 9) (NEDD-9) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-12) (p105) [Cleaved into: Enhancer of filamentation 1 p55]
GeneName	NEDD9 CASL
Length	174
Function	Scaffolding protein which plays a central coordinating role for tyrosine-kinase-based signaling related to cell adhesion (PubMed:24574519). As a focal adhesion protein, plays a role in embryonic fibroblast migration (By similarity). May play an important role in integrin beta-1 or B cell antigen receptor (BCR) mediated signaling in B- and T-cells. Integrin beta-1 stimulation leads to recruitment of various proteins including CRKL and SHPTP2 to the tyrosine phosphorylated form (PubMed:9020138). Promotes adhesion and migration of lymphocytes; as a result required for the correct migration of lymphocytes to the spleen and other secondary lymphoid organs (PubMed:17174122). Plays a role in the organization of T-cell F-actin cortical cytoskeleton and the centralization of T-cell receptor microclusters at the immunological synapse (By similarity). Negatively regulates cilia outgrowth in polarized cysts (By similarity). Modulates cilia disassembly via activation of AURKA-mediated phosphorylation of HDAC6 and subsequent deacetylation of alpha-tubulin (PubMed:17604723). Positively regulates RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis (By similarity). Required for the maintenance of hippocampal dendritic spines in the dentate gyrus and CA1 regions, thereby involved in spatial learning and memory (By similarity).
