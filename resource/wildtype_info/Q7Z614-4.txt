UniprotID	Q7Z614-4
Accession	Q7Z614;A8K9D5;Q08E98;Q6P4H2;Q8IV59
EntryName	SNX20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sorting nexin-20 (Selectin ligand-interactor cytoplasmic 1) (SLIC-1)
GeneName	SNX20 SLIC1
Length	102
Function	May play a role in cellular vesicle trafficking. Has been proposed to function as a sorting protein that targets SELPLG into endosomes, but has no effect on SELPLG internalization from the cell surface, or on SELPLG-mediated cell-cell adhesion.
