UniprotID	Q01523
Accession	Q01523;A0JDY6;Q3KNV2
EntryName	DEF5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Defensin alpha 5 (Defensin-5) (HD5(20-94)) [Cleaved into: HD5(23-94); HD5(29-94); HD5(56-94); HD5(63-94)]
GeneName	DEFA5 DEF5
Length	94
Function	Host-defense peptide that maintains sterility in the urogenital system (PubMed:12021776, PubMed:12660734, PubMed:15616305, PubMed:19589339, PubMed:22359618, PubMed:22573326, PubMed:25354318, PubMed:25782105, PubMed:30808760). Has antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria, including Gram-negative E.coli, P.aeruginosa and S.typhimurium, and Gram-positive E.aerogenes, S.aureus, B.cereus, E.faecium and L.monocytogenes (PubMed:12021776, PubMed:15616305, PubMed:19589339, PubMed:22359618, PubMed:22573326, PubMed:25354318, PubMed:30808760). Confers resistance to intestinal infection by S.typhimurium (PubMed:12660734). Exhibits antimicrobial activity against enteric commensal bacteria such as B.adolescentis, L.acidophilus, B.breve, L.fermentum, B.longum and S.thermophilus (PubMed:25354318). Binds to bacterial membranes and causes membrane disintegration (PubMed:25782105). Induces the secretion of the chemokine IL-8 by intestinal epithelial cells (PubMed:19589339). Binds to B.antracis lef/lethal factor, a major virulence factor from B.anthracis, and neutralizes its enzymatic activity (PubMed:22573326).
