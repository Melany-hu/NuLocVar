Accession	Q8NG11;A6NHE1;B4DHY6;D3DWD7;D3DWD8;Q567U7;Q9BU34;Q9H0U1
EntryName	TSN14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tetraspanin-14 (Tspan-14) (DC-TM4F2) (Transmembrane 4 superfamily member 14)
GeneName	TSPAN14 TM4SF14
Length	147
Function	Part of TspanC8 subgroup, composed of 6 members that interact with the transmembrane metalloprotease ADAM10. This interaction is required for ADAM10 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and for enzymatic maturation and trafficking to the cell surface as well as substrate specificity. Different TspanC8/ADAM10 complexes have distinct substrates (PubMed:23035126, PubMed:26668317, PubMed:26686862, PubMed:37516108). Negatively regulates ADAM10-mediated cleavage of GP6 (By similarity). Promotes ADAM10-mediated cleavage of CDH5 (By similarity).
