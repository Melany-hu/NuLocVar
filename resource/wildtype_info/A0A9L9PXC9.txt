UniprotID	A0A9L9PXC9
Accession	A0A9L9PXC9
EntryName	A0A9L9PXC9_HUMAN
ProteinName	High mobility group nucleosome-binding domain-containing protein 3
GeneName	HMGN3
Length	124
Function	Binds to nucleosomes, regulating chromatin structure and consequently, chromatin-dependent processes such as transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair. Affects both insulin and glucagon levels and modulates the expression of pancreatic genes involved in insulin secretion. Regulates the expression of the glucose transporter SLC2A2 by binding specifically to its promoter region and recruiting PDX1 and additional transcription factors. Regulates the expression of SLC6A9, a glycine transporter which regulates the glycine concentration in synaptic junctions in the central nervous system, by binding to its transcription start site. May play a role in ocular development and astrocyte function.
