EntryName	MUC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mucin-1 (MUC-1) (Breast carcinoma-associated antigen DF3) (Cancer antigen 15-3) (CA 15-3) (Carcinoma-associated mucin) (Episialin) (H23AG) (Krebs von den Lungen-6) (KL-6) (PEMT) (Peanut-reactive urinary mucin) (PUM) (Polymorphic epithelial mucin) (PEM) (Tumor-associated epithelial membrane antigen) (EMA) (Tumor-associated mucin) (CD antigen CD227) [Cleaved into: Mucin-1 subunit alpha (MUC1-NT) (MUC1-alpha); Mucin-1 subunit beta (MUC1-beta) (MUC1-CT)]
GeneName	MUC1 PUM
Length	203
Function	The alpha subunit has cell adhesive properties. Can act both as an adhesion and an anti-adhesion protein. May provide a protective layer on epithelial cells against bacterial and enzyme attack.
