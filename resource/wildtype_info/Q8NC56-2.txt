Accession	Q8NC56;B4DVH5;E7EVT2;Q5T972;Q5T974
EntryName	LEMD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	LEM domain-containing protein 2 (hLEM2)
GeneName	LEMD2
Length	201
Function	Nuclear lamina-associated inner nuclear membrane protein that is involved in nuclear structure organization, maintenance of nuclear envelope (NE) integrity and NE reformation after mitosis (PubMed:16339967, PubMed:17097643, PubMed:28242692, PubMed:32494070). Plays a role as transmembrane adapter for the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT), and is thereby involved in ESCRT-mediated NE reformation (PubMed:28242692, PubMed:32494070). Promotes ESCRT-mediated NE closure by recruiting CHMP7 and downstream ESCRT-III proteins IST1/CHMP8 and CHMP2A to the reforming NE during anaphase (PubMed:28242692). During nuclear reassembly, condenses into a liquid-like coating around microtubule spindles and coassembles with CHMP7 to form a macromolecular O-ring seal at the confluence between membranes, chromatin, and the spindle to facilitate early nuclear sealing (PubMed:32494070). Plays a role in the organization of heterochromatin associated with the NE and in the maintenance of NE organization under mechanical stress (By similarity). Required for embryonic development and involved in regulation of several signaling pathways such as MAPK and AKT (By similarity). Required for myoblast differentiation involving regulation of ERK signaling (By similarity). Essential for cardiac homeostasis and proper heart function (By similarity).
