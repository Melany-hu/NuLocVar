UniprotID	P61952
Accession	P61952;P50152
EntryName	GBG11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(O) subunit gamma-11
GeneName	GNG11 GNGT11
Length	73
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
