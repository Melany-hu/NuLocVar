UniprotID	O14933-2
Accession	O14933;A6NDM6;A8MY53;Q8N5D8;Q9UEZ0
EntryName	UB2L6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin/ISG15-conjugating enzyme E2 L6 (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme L6) (Retinoic acid-induced gene B protein) (RIG-B) (UbcH8) (Ubiquitin carrier protein L6) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase L6)
GeneName	UBE2L6 UBCH8
Length	87
Function	Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin or ISG15 to other proteins. Functions in the E6/E6-AP-induced ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Promotes ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of FLT3.
