UniprotID	Q9NSD5-3
Accession	Q9NSD5;B4DJL1;Q8TCC2;Q8WW56
EntryName	S6A13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium- and chloride-dependent GABA transporter 2 (GAT-2) (Solute carrier family 6 member 13)
GeneName	SLC6A13 GAT2
Length	97
Function	Mediates sodium- and chloride-dependent transport of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (PubMed:17502375, PubMed:22932902). Mediates transport of beta-alanine (PubMed:17502375). Can also mediate transport of taurine and hypotaurine (By similarity).
