UniprotID	P14209-3
Accession	P14209;A6NIW1;O00518;Q6ICV7
EntryName	CD99_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD99 antigen (12E7) (E2 antigen) (Protein MIC2) (T-cell surface glycoprotein E2) (CD antigen CD99)
GeneName	CD99 MIC2 MIC2X MIC2Y
Length	169
Function	Involved in T-cell adhesion processes and in spontaneous rosette formation with erythrocytes. Plays a role in a late step of leukocyte extravasation helping leukocytes to overcome the endothelial basement membrane. Acts at the same site as, but independently of, PECAM1. Involved in T-cell adhesion processes (By similarity).
