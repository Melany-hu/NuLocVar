UniprotID	P68106-2
Accession	P68106;Q13664;Q16645;Q53TM2;Q9BQ40
EntryName	FKB1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP1B (PPIase FKBP1B) (EC 5.2.1.8) (12.6 kDa FK506-binding protein) (12.6 kDa FKBP) (FKBP-12.6) (FK506-binding protein 1B) (FKBP-1B) (Immunophilin FKBP12.6) (Rotamase) (h-FKBP-12)
GeneName	FKBP1B FKBP12.6 FKBP1L FKBP9 OTK4
Length	80
Function	Has the potential to contribute to the immunosuppressive and toxic effects of FK506 and rapamycin. PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides.
