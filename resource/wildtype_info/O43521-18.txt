EntryName	B2L11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bcl-2-like protein 11 (Bcl2-L-11) (Bcl2-interacting mediator of cell death)
GeneName	BCL2L11 BIM
Length	103
Function	Induces apoptosis and anoikis. Isoform BimL is more potent than isoform BimEL. Isoform Bim-alpha1, isoform Bim-alpha2 and isoform Bim-alpha3 induce apoptosis, although less potent than isoform BimEL, isoform BimL and isoform BimS. Isoform Bim-gamma induces apoptosis. Isoform Bim-alpha3 induces apoptosis possibly through a caspase-mediated pathway. Isoform BimAC and isoform BimABC lack the ability to induce apoptosis.
