UniprotID	P0C0S5
Accession	P0C0S5;B2RD56;P17317;Q6I9U0
EntryName	H2AZ_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A.Z (H2A/z)
GeneName	H2AZ1 H2AFZ H2AZ
Length	128
Function	Variant histone H2A which replaces conventional H2A in a subset of nucleosomes. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling. May be involved in the formation of constitutive heterochromatin. May be required for chromosome segregation during cell division.
