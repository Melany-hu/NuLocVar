EntryName	SAR1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small COPII coat GTPase SAR1A (EC 3.6.5.2) (COPII-associated small GTPase) (Secretion-associated Ras-related GTPase 1A)
GeneName	SAR1A SAR1 SARA SARA1
Length	198
Function	Small GTPase that cycles between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound state and mainly functions in vesicle-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi transport. The active GTP-bound form inserts into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane where it recruits the remainder of the coat protein complex II/COPII. The coat protein complex II assembling and polymerizing on endoplasmic reticulum membrane is responsible for both the sorting of cargos and the deformation and budding of membranes into vesicles destined to the Golgi (PubMed:23433038, PubMed:32358066, PubMed:36369712). The GTPase activity of SAR1 by controlling the timing of COPII budding regulates the size of the formed vesicles and is important for cargo selection depending on their size (PubMed:32358066). Together with SEC16A, forms the organized scaffold defining endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES), some specific domains of the endoplasmic reticulum where COPII vesicles form (PubMed:17005010). In addition to its role in vesicle trafficking, can also function as a leucine sensor regulating TORC1 signaling and more indirectly cellular metabolism, growth and survival. In absence of leucine, interacts with the GATOR2 complex via MIOS and inhibits TORC1 signaling. The binding of leucine abrogates the interaction with GATOR2 and the inhibition of the TORC1 signaling. This function is completely independent of the GTPase activity of SAR1B (PubMed:34290409).
