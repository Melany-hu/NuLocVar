UniprotID	Q9UHA4
Accession	Q9UHA4;B2R4A1;J3KMX4;Q9H364
EntryName	LTOR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ragulator complex protein LAMTOR3 (Late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor and MAPK and MTOR activator 3) (MEK-binding partner 1) (Mp1) (Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1-interacting protein 1) (Mitogen-activated protein kinase scaffold protein 1)
GeneName	LAMTOR3 MAP2K1IP1 MAPKSP1 PRO2783
Length	124
Function	As part of the Ragulator complex it is involved in amino acid sensing and activation of mTORC1, a signaling complex promoting cell growth in response to growth factors, energy levels, and amino acids (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:22980980, PubMed:28935770, PubMed:29107538, PubMed:29123114, PubMed:29158492, PubMed:30181260). Activated by amino acids through a mechanism involving the lysosomal V-ATPase, the Ragulator plays a dual role for the small GTPases Rag (RagA/RRAGA, RagB/RRAGB, RagC/RRAGC and/or RagD/RRAGD): it (1) acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), activating the small GTPases Rag and (2) mediates recruitment of Rag GTPases to the lysosome membrane (PubMed:22980980, PubMed:28935770, PubMed:29107538, PubMed:29123114, PubMed:29158492, PubMed:30181260). Activated Ragulator and Rag GTPases function as a scaffold recruiting mTORC1 to lysosomes where it is in turn activated (PubMed:22980980, PubMed:28935770, PubMed:29107538, PubMed:29123114, PubMed:29158492, PubMed:30181260). Adapter protein that enhances the efficiency of the MAP kinase cascade facilitating the activation of MAPK2 (By similarity).
