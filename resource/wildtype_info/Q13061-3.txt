EntryName	TRDN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Triadin
GeneName	TRDN
Length	167
Function	Contributes to the regulation of lumenal Ca2+ release via the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channels RYR1 and RYR2, a key step in triggering skeletal and heart muscle contraction. Required for normal organization of the triad junction, where T-tubules and the sarcoplasmic reticulum terminal cisternae are in close contact (By similarity). Required for normal skeletal muscle strength. Plays a role in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart and in regulating the rate of heart beats.
