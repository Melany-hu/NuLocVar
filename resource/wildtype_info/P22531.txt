UniprotID	P22531
Accession	P22531;Q5T9T4;Q96RM2
EntryName	SPR2E_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small proline-rich protein 2E (SPR-2E) (Small proline-rich protein II) (SPR-II)
GeneName	SPRR2E
Length	72
Function	Cross-linked envelope protein of keratinocytes. It is a keratinocyte protein that first appears in the cell cytosol, but ultimately becomes cross-linked to membrane proteins by transglutaminase. All that results in the formation of an insoluble envelope beneath the plasma membrane.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
