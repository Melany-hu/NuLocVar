UniprotID	A0A994J434
Accession	A0A994J434
EntryName	A0A994J434_HUMAN
ProteinName	High mobility group protein HMG-I/HMG-Y (High mobility group AT-hook protein 1)
GeneName	HMGA1
Length	106
Function	HMG-I/Y bind preferentially to the minor groove of A+T rich regions in double-stranded DNA. It is suggested that these proteins could function in nucleosome phasing and in the 3'-end processing of mRNA transcripts. They are also involved in the transcription regulation of genes containing, or in close proximity to A+T-rich regions.
