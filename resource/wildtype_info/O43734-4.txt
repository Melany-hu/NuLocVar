EntryName	CIKS_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3IP2 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Adapter protein CIKS) (Connection to IKK and SAPK/JNK) (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CIKS) (Nuclear factor NF-kappa-B activator 1) (ACT1) (TRAF3-interacting protein 2)
GeneName	TRAF3IP2 C6orf2 C6orf4 C6orf5 C6orf6
Length	109
Function	E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of target protein, enhancing protein-protein interaction and cell signaling (PubMed:19825828). Transfers ubiquitin from E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2V1-UBE2N to substrate protein (PubMed:19825828). Essential adapter molecule in IL17A-mediated signaling (PubMed:19825828, PubMed:24120361). Upon IL17A stimulation, interacts with IL17RA and IL17RC receptor chains through SEFIR domains and catalyzes 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF6, leading to TRAF6-mediated activation of NF-kappa-B and MAPkinase pathways (PubMed:19825828).
