EntryName	ECHD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ethylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.94) (Enoyl-CoA hydratase domain-containing protein 1) (Methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase) (MMCD)
GeneName	ECHDC1
Length	70
Function	Decarboxylates ethylmalonyl-CoA, a potentially toxic metabolite, to form butyryl-CoA, suggesting it might be involved in metabolite proofreading (PubMed:22016388). Acts preferentially on (S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA but also has some activity on the (R)-isomer (By similarity). Also has methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase activity at lower level (By similarity).
