UniprotID	O00258-2
Accession	O00258;A8KAP8;A8MQ44;D3DSH9;O60740
EntryName	GET1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guided entry of tail-anchored proteins factor 1 (Congenital heart disease 5 protein) (Tail-anchored protein insertion receptor WRB) (Tryptophan-rich basic protein)
GeneName	GET1 CHD5 WRB
Length	140
Function	Required for the post-translational delivery of tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (PubMed:21444755, PubMed:23041287, PubMed:24392163, PubMed:27226539). Together with CAMLG/GET2, acts as a membrane receptor for soluble GET3/TRC40, which recognizes and selectively binds the transmembrane domain of TA proteins in the cytosol (PubMed:21444755, PubMed:23041287, PubMed:24392163, PubMed:27226539). Required to ensure correct topology and ER insertion of CAMLG (PubMed:31417168, PubMed:32187542).
