UniprotID	Q93091
Accession	Q93091
EntryName	RNAS6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease K6 (RNase K6) (EC 3.1.27.-)
GeneName	RNASE6 RNS6
Length	150
Function	Ribonuclease which shows a preference for the pyrimidines uridine and cytosine (PubMed:27013146, PubMed:8836175). Has potent antibacterial activity against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including P.aeruginosa, A.baumanii, M.luteus, S.aureus, E.faecalis, E.faecium, S.saprophyticus and E.coli (PubMed:25075772, PubMed:27089320). Causes loss of bacterial membrane integrity, and also promotes agglutination of Gram-negative bacteria (PubMed:27089320). Probably contributes to urinary tract sterility (PubMed:25075772). Bactericidal activity is independent of RNase activity (PubMed:27089320).
