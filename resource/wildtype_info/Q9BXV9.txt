EntryName	GON7_HUMAN
ProteinName	EKC/KEOPS complex subunit GON7
GeneName	GON7 C14orf142
Length	100
Function	Component of the EKC/KEOPS complex that is required for the formation of a threonylcarbamoyl group on adenosine at position 37 (t(6)A37) in tRNAs that read codons beginning with adenine (PubMed:27903914, PubMed:31481669). The complex is probably involved in the transfer of the threonylcarbamoyl moiety of threonylcarbamoyl-AMP (TC-AMP) to the N6 group of A37 (PubMed:27903914, PubMed:31481669). GON7 plays a supporting role to the catalytic subunit OSGEP in the complex (PubMed:27903914, PubMed:31481669).
