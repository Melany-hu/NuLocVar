Accession	O94916;A2RRB4;A6H8V5;E9PHR7;O95693;Q7LA65;Q969Q8;Q96QH3;Q9UN18
EntryName	NFAT5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NF-AT5) (T-cell transcription factor NFAT5) (Tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein) (TonE-binding protein) (TonEBP)
GeneName	NFAT5 KIAA0827 TONEBP
Length	99
Function	Transcription factor involved, among others, in the transcriptional regulation of osmoprotective and inflammatory genes. Binds the DNA consensus sequence 5'-TGGAAAA-3' (PubMed:10377394). Mediates the transcriptional response to hypertonicity (PubMed:10051678). Positively regulates the transcription of LCN2 and S100A4 genes; optimal transactivation of these genes requires the presence of DDX5/DDX17 (PubMed:22266867). Also involved in the DNA damage response by preventing formation of R-loops; R-loops are composed of a DNA:RNA hybrid and the associated non-template single-stranded DNA (PubMed:34049076).
