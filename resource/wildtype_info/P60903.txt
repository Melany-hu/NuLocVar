UniprotID	P60903
Accession	P60903;A8K4V8;P08206;Q5T1C5
EntryName	S10AA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein S100-A10 (Calpactin I light chain) (Calpactin-1 light chain) (Cellular ligand of annexin II) (S100 calcium-binding protein A10) (p10 protein) (p11)
GeneName	S100A10 ANX2LG CAL1L CLP11
Length	97
Function	Because S100A10 induces the dimerization of ANXA2/p36, it may function as a regulator of protein phosphorylation in that the ANXA2 monomer is the preferred target (in vitro) of tyrosine-specific kinase.
