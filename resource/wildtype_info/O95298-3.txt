UniprotID	O95298-3
Accession	O95298;E9PNU8;E9PRB2;Q549M5;Q6FIH8;Q9UBJ9
EntryName	NDUC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 subunit C2 (Complex I-B14.5b) (CI-B14.5b) (Human lung cancer oncogene 1 protein) (HLC-1) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B14.5b)
GeneName	NDUFC2 HLC1
Length	88
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis but required for the complex assembly. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
