UniprotID	Q9NYR9
Accession	Q9NYR9;A6NCZ5;B3KNN0;B4DNM3;Q6PK52;Q96KC7;Q9NSX1
EntryName	KBRS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	NF-kappa-B inhibitor-interacting Ras-like protein 2 (I-kappa-B-interacting Ras-like protein 2) (Kappa B-Ras protein 2) (KappaB-Ras2)
GeneName	NKIRAS2 KBRAS2
Length	191
Function	Atypical Ras-like protein that acts as a potent regulator of NF-kappa-B activity by preventing the degradation of NF-kappa-B inhibitor beta (NFKBIB) by most signals, explaining why NFKBIB is more resistant to degradation. May act by blocking phosphorylation of NFKBIB and nuclear localization of p65/RELA NF-kappa-B subunit. It is unclear whether it acts as a GTPase. Both GTP- and GDP-bound forms block phosphorylation of NFKBIB (By similarity).
