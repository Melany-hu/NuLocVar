UniprotID	P13987
Accession	P13987;E9PR17
EntryName	CD59_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD59 glycoprotein (1F5 antigen) (20 kDa homologous restriction factor) (HRF-20) (HRF20) (MAC-inhibitory protein) (MAC-IP) (MEM43 antigen) (Membrane attack complex inhibition factor) (MACIF) (Membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis) (MIRL) (Protectin) (CD antigen CD59)
GeneName	CD59 MIC11 MIN1 MIN2 MIN3 MSK21
Length	128
Function	Potent inhibitor of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) action. Acts by binding to the C8 and/or C9 complements of the assembling MAC, thereby preventing incorporation of the multiple copies of C9 required for complete formation of the osmolytic pore. This inhibitor appears to be species-specific. Involved in signal transduction for T-cell activation complexed to a protein tyrosine kinase.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted
