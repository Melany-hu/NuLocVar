UniprotID	P56539
Accession	P56539;A8K777;Q3T1A4
EntryName	CAV3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caveolin-3 (M-caveolin)
GeneName	CAV3
Length	151
Function	May act as a scaffolding protein within caveolar membranes. Interacts directly with G-protein alpha subunits and can functionally regulate their activity. May also regulate voltage-gated potassium channels. Plays a role in the sarcolemma repair mechanism of both skeletal muscle and cardiomyocytes that permits rapid resealing of membranes disrupted by mechanical stress (By similarity). Mediates the recruitment of CAVIN2 and CAVIN3 proteins to the caveolae (PubMed:19262564).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Cell membrane; Membrane; Caveola; Cell membrane; Sarcolemma
