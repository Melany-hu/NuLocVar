UniprotID	O15116
Accession	O15116;B2R5E6
EntryName	LSM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	U6 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein LSm1 (Cancer-associated Sm-like) (Small nuclear ribonuclear CaSm)
GeneName	LSM1 CASM
Length	133
Function	Plays a role in the degradation of histone mRNAs, the only eukaryotic mRNAs that are not polyadenylated (PubMed:18172165). Probably also part of an LSm subunits-containing complex involved in the general process of mRNA degradation (By similarity).
