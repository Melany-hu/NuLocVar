Accession	K7ES63
EntryName	K7ES63_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tubulin beta chain
GeneName	TUBB6
Length	116
Function	Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules, a cylinder consisting of laterally associated linear protofilaments composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers. Microtubules grow by the addition of GTP-tubulin dimers to the microtubule end, where a stabilizing cap forms. Below the cap, tubulin dimers are in GDP-bound state, owing to GTPase activity of alpha-tubulin.
