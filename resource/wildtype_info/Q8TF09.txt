UniprotID	Q8TF09
Accession	Q8TF09
EntryName	DLRB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynein light chain roadblock-type 2 (Dynein light chain 2B, cytoplasmic) (Roadblock domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	DYNLRB2 DNCL2B DNLC2B ROBLD2
Length	96
Function	Acts as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex that are thought to be involved in linking dynein to cargos and to adapter proteins that regulate dynein function. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
