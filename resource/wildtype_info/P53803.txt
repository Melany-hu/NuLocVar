UniprotID	P53803
Accession	P53803;Q6IBD4
EntryName	RPAB4_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerases I, II, and III subunit RPABC4 (RNA polymerases I, II, and III subunit ABC4) (ABC10-alpha) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit K) (RNA polymerase II 7.0 kDa subunit) (RPB7.0) (RPB10alpha)
GeneName	POLR2K
Length	58
Function	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Common component of RNA polymerases I, II and III which synthesize ribosomal RNA precursors, mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs, and a small RNAs, such as 5S rRNA and tRNAs, respectively.
