UniprotID	A0A087WUN5
Accession	A0A087WUN5
EntryName	A0A087WUN5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 16 (Cyclosome subunit 16)
GeneName	ANAPC16
Length	85
Function	Component of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis and the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The APC/C complex acts by mediating ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins: it mainly mediates the formation of 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitin chains and, to a lower extent, the formation of 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains. The APC/C complex catalyzes assembly of branched 'Lys-11'-/'Lys-48'-linked branched ubiquitin chains on target proteins.
