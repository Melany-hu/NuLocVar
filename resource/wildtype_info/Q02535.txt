UniprotID	Q02535
Accession	Q02535;A8K1T8;O75641
EntryName	ID3_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-binding protein inhibitor ID-3 (Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 25) (bHLHb25) (Helix-loop-helix protein HEIR-1) (ID-like protein inhibitor HLH 1R21) (Inhibitor of DNA binding 3) (Inhibitor of differentiation 3)
GeneName	ID3 1R21 BHLHB25 HEIR1
Length	119
Function	Transcriptional regulator (lacking a basic DNA binding domain) which negatively regulates the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors by forming heterodimers and inhibiting their DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Implicated in regulating a variety of cellular processes, including cellular growth, senescence, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and neoplastic transformation. Involved in myogenesis by inhibiting skeletal muscle and cardiac myocyte differentiation and promoting muscle precursor cells proliferation. Inhibits the binding of E2A-containing protein complexes to muscle creatine kinase E-box enhancer. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
