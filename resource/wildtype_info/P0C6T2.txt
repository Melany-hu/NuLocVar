UniprotID	P0C6T2
Accession	P0C6T2
EntryName	OST4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase subunit 4
GeneName	OST4
Length	37
Function	Subunit of the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) complex that catalyzes the initial transfer of a defined glycan (Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) in eukaryotes) from the lipid carrier dolichol-pyrophosphate to an asparagine residue within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif in nascent polypeptide chains, the first step in protein N-glycosylation (PubMed:31831667). N-glycosylation occurs cotranslationally and the complex associates with the Sec61 complex at the channel-forming translocon complex that mediates protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). All subunits are required for a maximal enzyme activity. Specifically involved in maintaining stability of STT3A-containing OST complexes.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
