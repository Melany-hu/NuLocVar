EntryName	FXYD5_HUMAN
ProteinName	FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 5 (Dysadherin)
GeneName	FXYD5 DYSAD IWU1 HSPC113 UNQ2561/PRO6241
Length	107
Function	Associates with and regulates the activity of the sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase (NKA) which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of Na(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane (By similarity). May increase NKA activity by increasing the apparent affinity for Na(+) (PubMed:18263667). Involved in down-regulation of E-cadherin which results in reduced cell adhesion. Promotes metastasis (PubMed:11756660).
