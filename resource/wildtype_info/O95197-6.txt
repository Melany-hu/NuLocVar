EntryName	RTN3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Reticulon-3 (Homolog of ASY protein) (HAP) (Neuroendocrine-specific protein-like 2) (NSP-like protein 2) (Neuroendocrine-specific protein-like II) (NSP-like protein II) (NSPLII)
GeneName	RTN3 ASYIP NSPL2
Length	214
Function	May be involved in membrane trafficking in the early secretory pathway. Inhibits BACE1 activity and amyloid precursor protein processing. May induce caspase-8 cascade and apoptosis. May favor BCL2 translocation to the mitochondria upon endoplasmic reticulum stress. Induces the formation of endoplasmic reticulum tubules (PubMed:25612671). Also acts as an inflammation-resolving regulator by interacting with both TRIM25 and RIGI, subsequently impairing RIGI 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination leading to IRF3 and NF-kappa-B inhibition.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane
