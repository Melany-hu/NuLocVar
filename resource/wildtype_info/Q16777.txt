UniprotID	Q16777
Accession	Q16777;Q6DRA7;Q8IUE5
EntryName	H2A2C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A type 2-C (H2A-clustered histone 20) (Histone H2A-GL101) (Histone H2A/q)
GeneName	H2AC20 H2AFQ HIST2H2AC
Length	129
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
