UniprotID	Q9HBE4
Accession	Q9HBE4;A5J0L4
EntryName	IL21_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-21 (IL-21) (Za11)
GeneName	IL21
Length	162
Function	Cytokine with immunoregulatory activity. May promote the transition between innate and adaptive immunity. Induces the production of IgG(1) and IgG(3) in B-cells (By similarity). Implicated in the generation and maintenance of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and the formation of germinal-centers. Together with IL6, control the early generation of Tfh cells and are critical for an effective antibody response to acute viral infection (By similarity). May play a role in proliferation and maturation of natural killer (NK) cells in synergy with IL15. May regulate proliferation of mature B- and T-cells in response to activating stimuli. In synergy with IL15 and IL18 stimulates interferon gamma production in T-cells and NK cells (PubMed:11081504, PubMed:15178704). During T-cell mediated immune response may inhibit dendritic cells (DC) activation and maturation (By similarity).
