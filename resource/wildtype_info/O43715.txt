UniprotID	O43715
Accession	O43715;B2R4Z7;Q5RKS5;Q6LCA7
EntryName	TRIA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	TP53-regulated inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (Protein 15E1.1) (WF-1) (p53-inducible cell-survival factor) (p53CSV)
GeneName	TRIAP1 15E1.1 HSPC132
Length	76
Function	Involved in the modulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by ensuring the accumulation of cardiolipin (CL) in mitochondrial membranes. In vitro, the TRIAP1:PRELID1 complex mediates the transfer of phosphatidic acid (PA) between liposomes and probably functions as a PA transporter across the mitochondrion intermembrane space to provide PA for CL synthesis in the inner membrane (PubMed:23931759). Likewise, the TRIAP1:PRELID3A complex mediates the transfer of phosphatidic acid (PA) between liposomes (in vitro) and probably functions as a PA transporter across the mitochondrion intermembrane space (in vivo) (PubMed:26071602). Mediates cell survival by inhibiting activation of caspase-9 which prevents induction of apoptosis (PubMed:15735003).
