Accession	P30044;A6NC19;A6NG06;B7ZLJ4;B7ZVW3;Q14CK0;Q6IAF2;Q9UBU5;Q9UJU4;Q9UKX4
EntryName	PRDX5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxiredoxin-5, mitochondrial (EC 1.11.1.24) (Alu corepressor 1) (Antioxidant enzyme B166) (AOEB166) (Liver tissue 2D-page spot 71B) (PLP) (Peroxiredoxin V) (Prx-V) (Peroxisomal antioxidant enzyme) (TPx type VI) (Thioredoxin peroxidase PMP20) (Thioredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxin 5)
GeneName	PRDX5 ACR1 SBBI10
Length	125
Function	Thiol-specific peroxidase that catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water and alcohols, respectively. Plays a role in cell protection against oxidative stress by detoxifying peroxides and as sensor of hydrogen peroxide-mediated signaling events.
