UniprotID	O43676
Accession	O43676;Q6IB80
EntryName	NDUB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 3 (Complex I-B12) (CI-B12) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B12 subunit)
GeneName	NDUFB3
Length	98
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
