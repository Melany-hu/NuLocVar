UniprotID	P54819-4
Accession	P54819;A8K6L1;B4DHH7;B4DL64;Q16856;Q5EB54;Q5TIF7;Q8TCY2;Q8TCY3
EntryName	KAD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenylate kinase 2, mitochondrial (AK 2) (EC 2.7.4.3) (ATP-AMP transphosphorylase 2) (ATP:AMP phosphotransferase) (Adenylate monophosphate kinase) [Cleaved into: Adenylate kinase 2, mitochondrial, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	AK2 ADK2
Length	130
Function	Catalyzes the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphate group between ATP and AMP. Plays an important role in cellular energy homeostasis and in adenine nucleotide metabolism. Adenylate kinase activity is critical for regulation of the phosphate utilization and the AMP de novo biosynthesis pathways. Plays a key role in hematopoiesis.
