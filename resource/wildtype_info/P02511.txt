UniprotID	P02511
Accession	P02511;B0YIX0;O43416;Q9UC37;Q9UC38;Q9UC39;Q9UC40;Q9UC41
EntryName	CRYAB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-crystallin B chain (Alpha(B)-crystallin) (Heat shock protein beta-5) (HspB5) (Heat shock protein family B member 5) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-27) (Rosenthal fiber component)
GeneName	CRYAB CRYA2 HSPB5
Length	175
Function	May contribute to the transparency and refractive index of the lens. Has chaperone-like activity, preventing aggregation of various proteins under a wide range of stress conditions. In lens epithelial cells, stabilizes the ATP6V1A protein, preventing its degradation by the proteasome (By similarity).
