UniprotID	Q9Y5J9
Accession	Q9Y5J9;B0YJA5;Q3KQS9;Q9UN04
EntryName	TIM8B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim8 B (DDP-like protein) (Deafness dystonia protein 2)
GeneName	TIMM8B DDP2 DDPL TIM8B
Length	83
Function	Probable mitochondrial intermembrane chaperone that participates in the import and insertion of some multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Also required for the transfer of beta-barrel precursors from the TOM complex to the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) of the outer membrane. Acts as a chaperone-like protein that protects the hydrophobic precursors from aggregation and guide them through the mitochondrial intermembrane space (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
