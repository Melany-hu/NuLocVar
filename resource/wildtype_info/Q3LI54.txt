UniprotID	Q3LI54
Accession	Q3LI54
EntryName	KR198_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 19-8
GeneName	KRTAP19-8 KAP19.8
Length	63
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
