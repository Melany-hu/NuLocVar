EntryName	PIGP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit P (Down syndrome critical region protein 5) (Down syndrome critical region protein C) (Phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class P protein) (PIG-P)
GeneName	PIGP DCRC DSCR5 DSCRC NPD010
Length	108
Function	Part of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex that catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol and participates in the first step of GPI biosynthesis.
