EntryName	SRBS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sorbin and SH3 domain-containing protein 2 (Arg-binding protein 2) (ArgBP2) (Arg/Abl-interacting protein 2) (Sorbin)
GeneName	SORBS2 ARGBP2 KIAA0777
Length	156
Function	Adapter protein that plays a role in the assembling of signaling complexes, being a link between ABL kinases and actin cytoskeleton. Can form complex with ABL1 and CBL, thus promoting ubiquitination and degradation of ABL1. May play a role in the regulation of pancreatic cell adhesion, possibly by acting on WASF1 phosphorylation, enhancing phosphorylation by ABL1, as well as dephosphorylation by PTPN12 (PubMed:18559503). Isoform 6 increases water and sodium absorption in the intestine and gall-bladder.
