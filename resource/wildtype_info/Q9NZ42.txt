UniprotID	Q9NZ42
Accession	Q9NZ42;B2R5L9
EntryName	PEN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-secretase subunit PEN-2 (Presenilin enhancer protein 2)
GeneName	PSENEN PEN2 MDS033
Length	101
Function	Essential subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, an endoprotease complex that catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptors and APP (amyloid-beta precursor protein) (PubMed:12522139, PubMed:12679784, PubMed:12740439, PubMed:12763021, PubMed:24941111, PubMed:30598546, PubMed:30630874). The gamma-secretase complex plays a role in Notch and Wnt signaling cascades and regulation of downstream processes via its role in processing key regulatory proteins, and by regulating cytosolic CTNNB1 levels (Probable). PSENEN modulates both endoproteolysis of presenilin and gamma-secretase activity (PubMed:12522139, PubMed:12679784, PubMed:12740439, PubMed:12763021, PubMed:24941111).
