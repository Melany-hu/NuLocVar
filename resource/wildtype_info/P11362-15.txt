EntryName	FGFR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR-1) (EC 2.7.10.1) (Basic fibroblast growth factor receptor 1) (BFGFR) (bFGF-R-1) (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 2) (FLT-2) (N-sam) (Proto-oncogene c-Fgr) (CD antigen CD331)
GeneName	FGFR1 BFGFR CEK FGFBR FLG FLT2 HBGFR
Length	150
Function	Tyrosine-protein kinase that acts as a cell-surface receptor for fibroblast growth factors and plays an essential role in the regulation of embryonic development, cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Required for normal mesoderm patterning and correct axial organization during embryonic development, normal skeletogenesis and normal development of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal system. Phosphorylates PLCG1, FRS2, GAB1 and SHB. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. Promotes phosphorylation of SHC1, STAT1 and PTPN11/SHP2. In the nucleus, enhances RPS6KA1 and CREB1 activity and contributes to the regulation of transcription. FGFR1 signaling is down-regulated by IL17RD/SEF, and by FGFR1 ubiquitination, internalization and degradation.
