UniprotID	Q8WW35
Accession	Q8WW35;A6NCN5
EntryName	DYT2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynein light chain Tctex-type protein 2B (Tctex1 domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	DYNLT2B TCTEX1D2
Length	142
Function	Acts as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 2 complex (dynein-2 complex), a motor protein complex that drives the movement of cargos along microtubules within cilia and flagella in concert with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system. Required for proper retrograde ciliary transport.
Subcellular Location	Dynein axonemal particle
