UniprotID	Q96L50-2
Accession	Q96L50;A5D6X3;B4DDE0;Q52M24;Q86SZ1;Q8N6H9
EntryName	LLR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine-rich repeat protein 1 (4-1BB-mediated-signaling molecule) (4-1BBlrr) (LRR-repeat protein 1) (LRR-1) (Peptidylprolyl isomerase-like 5)
GeneName	LRR1 PPIL5
Length	146
Function	Substrate recognition subunit of an ECS (Elongin BC-CUL2/5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:15601820). ECS(LRR1) ubiquitinates MCM7 and promotes CMG replisome disassembly by VCP and chromatin extraction during S-phase (By similarity). May negatively regulate the 4-1BB-mediated signaling cascades which result in the activation of NK-kappaB and JNK1 (PubMed:11804328).
