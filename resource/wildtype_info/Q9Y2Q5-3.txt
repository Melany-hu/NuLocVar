UniprotID	Q9Y2Q5-3
Accession	Q9Y2Q5;Q5VY97;Q5VY98;Q5VY99
EntryName	LTOR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ragulator complex protein LAMTOR2 (Endosomal adaptor protein p14) (Late endosomal/lysosomal Mp1-interacting protein) (Late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor and MAPK and MTOR activator 2) (Mitogen-activated protein-binding protein-interacting protein) (MAPBP-interacting protein) (Roadblock domain-containing protein 3)
GeneName	LAMTOR2 MAPBPIP ROBLD3 HSPC003
Length	95
Function	As part of the Ragulator complex it is involved in amino acid sensing and activation of mTORC1, a signaling complex promoting cell growth in response to growth factors, energy levels, and amino acids (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:28935770, PubMed:29107538, PubMed:29123114, PubMed:29158492). Activated by amino acids through a mechanism involving the lysosomal V-ATPase, the Ragulator plays a dual role for the small GTPases Rag (RagA/RRAGA, RagB/RRAGB, RagC/RRAGC and/or RagD/RRAGD): it (1) acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), activating the small GTPases Rag and (2) mediates recruitment of Rag GTPases to the lysosome membrane (PubMed:22980980, PubMed:28935770, PubMed:29107538, PubMed:29123114, PubMed:29158492, PubMed:30181260). Activated Ragulator and Rag GTPases function as a scaffold recruiting mTORC1 to lysosomes where it is in turn activated (PubMed:22980980, PubMed:29107538, PubMed:29123114, PubMed:29158492). Adapter protein that enhances the efficiency of the MAP kinase cascade facilitating the activation of MAPK2 (By similarity).
