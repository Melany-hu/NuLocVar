UniprotID	O00175
Accession	O00175;B2R5K2
EntryName	CCL24_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 24 (CK-beta-6) (Eosinophil chemotactic protein 2) (Eotaxin-2) (Myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 2) (MPIF-2) (Small-inducible cytokine A24)
GeneName	CCL24 MPIF2 SCYA24
Length	119
Function	Chemotactic for resting T-lymphocytes, and eosinophils (PubMed:9104803, PubMed:9365122). Has lower chemotactic activity for neutrophils but none for monocytes and activated lymphocytes (PubMed:9104803, PubMed:9365122). Is a strong suppressor of colony formation by a multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell line (PubMed:9104803, PubMed:9365122). Binds to CCR3 (PubMed:9104803, PubMed:9365122).
