EntryName	HOP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeodomain-only protein (Lung cancer-associated Y protein) (Not expressed in choriocarcinoma protein 1) (Odd homeobox protein 1)
GeneName	HOPX HOD HOP LAGY NECC1 OB1
Length	94
Function	Atypical homeodomain protein which does not bind DNA and is required to modulate cardiac growth and development. Acts via its interaction with SRF, thereby modulating the expression of SRF-dependent cardiac-specific genes and cardiac development. Prevents SRF-dependent transcription either by inhibiting SRF binding to DNA or by recruiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins that prevent transcription by SRF. Overexpression causes cardiac hypertrophy (By similarity). May act as a tumor suppressor. Acts as a co-chaperone for HSPA1A and HSPA1B chaperone proteins and assists in chaperone-mediated protein refolding (PubMed:27708256).
