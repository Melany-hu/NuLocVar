EntryName	PRUN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Exopolyphosphatase PRUNE1 (EC 3.6.1.1) (Drosophila-related expressed sequence 17) (DRES-17) (DRES17) (HTcD37) (Protein prune homolog 1) (hPrune)
GeneName	PRUNE1 PRUNE
Length	168
Function	Phosphodiesterase (PDE) that has higher activity toward cAMP than cGMP, as substrate. Plays a role in cell proliferation, migration and differentiation, and acts as a negative regulator of NME1. Plays a role in the regulation of neurogenesis (PubMed:28334956). Involved in the regulation of microtubule polymerization (PubMed:28334956).
