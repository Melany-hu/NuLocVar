UniprotID	Q6EEV6
Accession	Q6EEV6;A1L3W5
EntryName	SUMO4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ubiquitin-related modifier 4 (SUMO-4) (Small ubiquitin-like protein 4)
GeneName	SUMO4 SMT3H4
Length	95
Function	Ubiquitin-like protein which can be covalently attached to target lysines as a monomer. Does not seem to be involved in protein degradation and may modulate protein subcellular localization, stability or activity. Upon oxidative stress, conjugates to various anti-oxidant enzymes, chaperones, and stress defense proteins. May also conjugate to NFKBIA, TFAP2A and FOS, negatively regulating their transcriptional activity, and to NR3C1, positively regulating its transcriptional activity. Covalent attachment to its substrates requires prior activation by the E1 complex SAE1-SAE2 and linkage to the E2 enzyme UBE2I.
