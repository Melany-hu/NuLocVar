UniprotID	P50539-4
Accession	P50539;B1ANN7;D3DR25;D3DRA9;Q15887;Q6FHW2;Q96E53
EntryName	MXI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Max-interacting protein 1 (Max interactor 1) (Class C basic helix-loop-helix protein 11) (bHLHc11)
GeneName	MXI1 BHLHC11
Length	182
Function	Transcriptional repressor. MXI1 binds with MAX to form a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein complex which recognizes the core sequence 5'-CACTG-3'. MXI1 thus antagonizes MYC transcriptional activity by competing for MAX.
