UniprotID	P84095
Accession	P84095;P35238;Q8NI04
EntryName	RHOG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoG
GeneName	RHOG ARHG
Length	191
Function	Plays a role in immunological synaptic F-actin density and architecture organization (PubMed:33513601). Regulates actin reorganization in lymphocytes, possibly through the modulation of Rac1 activity (PubMed:33513601). Required for the formation of membrane ruffles during macropinocytosis (PubMed:15133129). Plays a role in cell migration and is required for the formation of cup-like structures during trans-endothelial migration of leukocytes (PubMed:17875742). Binds phospholipids in an activation-dependent manner; thereby acting as an anchor for other proteins to the plasma membrane (PM) (PubMed:33513601). Plays a role in exocytosis of cytotoxic granules (CG) by lymphocytes/Component of the exocytosis machinery in natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells (PubMed:33513601). Promotes the docking of cytotoxic granules (CG) to the plasma membrane through the interaction with UNC13D (PubMed:33513601). Involved in the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes/primary CD8+ T cells (PubMed:33513601).
