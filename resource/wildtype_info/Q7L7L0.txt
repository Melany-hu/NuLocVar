UniprotID	Q7L7L0
Accession	Q7L7L0;B2R4S4
EntryName	H2A3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A type 3 (H2A-clustered histone 25)
GeneName	H2AC25 H2AW HIST3H2A
Length	130
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
