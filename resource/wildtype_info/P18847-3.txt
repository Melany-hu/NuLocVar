UniprotID	P18847-3
Accession	P18847;Q5VTZ2;Q6ICQ9;Q7Z566;Q8WYM6
EntryName	ATF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor ATF-3 (cAMP-dependent transcription factor ATF-3) (Activating transcription factor 3)
GeneName	ATF3
Length	135
Function	This protein binds the cAMP response element (CRE) (consensus: 5'-GTGACGT-3'), a sequence present in many viral and cellular promoters. Represses transcription from promoters with ATF sites. It may repress transcription by stabilizing the binding of inhibitory cofactors at the promoter.
