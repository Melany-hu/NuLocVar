EntryName	PA2GE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Group IIE secretory phospholipase A2 (GIIE sPLA2) (sPLA2-IIE) (EC 3.1.1.4) (Phosphatidylcholine 2-acylhydrolase 2E)
GeneName	PLA2G2E
Length	142
Function	Secretory calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 that primarily targets extracellular phospholipids (PubMed:10681567, PubMed:11922621, PubMed:28883454). Hydrolyzes the ester bond of the fatty acyl group attached at sn-2 position of phospholipids (phospholipase A2 activity), releasing various unsaturated fatty acids including oleoate, linoleoate, arachidonate, docosahexaenoate and lysophosphatidylethanolamines in preference to lysophosphatidylcholines (PubMed:10681567, PubMed:28883454). In response to high-fat diet, hydrolyzes minor lipoprotein phospholipids including phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidylglycerols, altering lipoprotein composition and fat storage in adipose tissue and liver (By similarity). May act in an autocrine and paracrine manner (PubMed:11922621). Contributes to lipid remodeling of cellular membranes and generation of lipid mediators involved in pathogen clearance. Cleaves sn-2 fatty acyl chains of phosphatidylglycerols and phosphatidylethanolamines, which are major components of membrane phospholipids in bacteria (PubMed:11922621). Acts as a hair follicle phospholipase A2. Selectively releases lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPE) and various unsaturated fatty acids in skin to regulate hair follicle homeostasis (By similarity). May regulate the inflammatory response by releasing arachidonate, a precursor of prostaglandins and leukotrienes (PubMed:11922621). Upon allergen exposure, may participate in allergic inflammatory response by enhancing leukotriene C4 synthesis and degranulation in mast cells (By similarity).
