UniprotID	Q9P003-2
Accession	Q9P003;A8K1Q8;B2R553;Q9H0X8
EntryName	CNIH4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein cornichon homolog 4 (CNIH-4) (Cornichon family AMPA receptor auxiliary protein 4)
GeneName	CNIH4 HSPC163
Length	92
Function	Involved in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface; it promotes the exit of GPCRs from the early secretory pathway, likely through interaction with the COPII machinery (PubMed:24405750).
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum; Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment
