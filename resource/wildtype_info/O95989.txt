EntryName	NUDT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase 1 (DIPP-1) (EC 3.6.1.52) (Diadenosine hexaphosphate hydrolase) (Ap6A hydrolase) (EC 3.6.1.61) (Endopolyphosphatase) (EC 3.6.1.10) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 3) (Nudix motif 3) (m7GpppN-mRNA hydrolase) (EC 3.6.1.62) (m7GpppX diphosphatase) (EC 3.6.1.59)
GeneName	NUDT3 DIPP DIPP1
Length	172
Function	Cleaves a beta-phosphate from the diphosphate groups in PP-InsP5 (diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate) and 2-InsP4 (bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate), suggesting that it may play a role in signal transduction (PubMed:10585413, PubMed:12370170, PubMed:9822604). InsP6 (inositol hexakisphosphate) is not a substrate (PubMed:9822604). Acts as a negative regulator of the ERK1/2 pathway (By similarity). Also able to catalyze the hydrolysis of dinucleoside oligophosphates, with diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P6-hexaphosphate (Ap6A) and diadenosine 5',5'''- P1,P5-pentaphosphate (Ap5A) being the preferred substrates (PubMed:10419486, PubMed:12370170). The major reaction products are ADP and p4a from Ap6A and ADP and ATP from Ap5A (PubMed:12370170). Also able to hydrolyze 5-phosphoribose 1-diphosphate (PubMed:12370170). Acts as a decapping enzyme that modulates the stability of a subset of mRNAs implicated in cell motility (PubMed:26932476). Hydrolyzes monomethylated capped RNA after both the alpha- and beta-phosphates generating m7GMP + ppRNA and m7GDP + pRNA (PubMed:32727897). Can hydrolyze unmethylated capped RNAs (By similarity). Divalent cations zinc, magnesium and manganese determine its substrate specificity (PubMed:34788624). Exhibits diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase in the presence of magnesium ions, diadenosine hexaphosphate hydrolase activity in the presence of manganese ions and endopolyphosphatase activity in the presence of zinc ions (PubMed:34788624). Plays an important role in limiting DNA damage and maintaining cell survival upon oxidative stress via its endopolyphosphatase activity (PubMed:34788624).
