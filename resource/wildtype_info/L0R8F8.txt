UniprotID	L0R8F8
Accession	L0R8F8
EntryName	MIDUO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial ribosome and complex I assembly factor AltMIEF1 (Alternative MIEF1 protein) (AltMIEF1) (MIEF1 microprotein) (MIEF1-MP) (alternative transcript upstream of MiD51) (AltMiD51)
GeneName	MIEF1 AltMiD51 AltMIEF1
Length	70
Function	Assembly factor involved in the biogenesis of the mitochondrial-specific ribosomes (mitoribosomes) (PubMed:28892042, PubMed:30215512, PubMed:31666358). Specifically associates with intermediates of the mitochondrial ribosome large subunit (mt-LSU) and is required for proper ribosome assembly, possibly preventing premature association of the large and small ribosomal subunits (PubMed:28892042, PubMed:30215512, PubMed:31666358). Thereby, indirectly regulates mitochondrial translation (PubMed:28892042, PubMed:30215512, PubMed:31666358). It is also required for complete assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (PubMed:31666358). May also function in DNM1L-mediated mitochondrial fission (PubMed:29083303).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
