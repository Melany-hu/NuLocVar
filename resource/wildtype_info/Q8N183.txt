UniprotID	Q8N183
Accession	Q8N183;A8K5I1
EntryName	NDUF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex assembly factor 2 (B17.2-like) (B17.2L) (Mimitin) (Myc-induced mitochondrial protein) (MMTN) (NDUFA12-like protein)
GeneName	NDUFAF2 NDUFA12L
Length	169
Function	Acts as a molecular chaperone for mitochondrial complex I assembly (PubMed:16200211, PubMed:19384974). Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone (PubMed:16200211, PubMed:27626371). Is involved in the initial steps of cilia formation, including removal of CP110 from the mother centrioles, docking of membrane vesicles to the mother centrioles, and establishment of the transition zone (PubMed:38949024).
