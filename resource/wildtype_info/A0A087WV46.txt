UniprotID	A0A087WV46
Accession	A0A087WV46
EntryName	A0A087WV46_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ragulator complex protein LAMTOR4 (Late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor and MAPK and MTOR activator 4)
GeneName	LAMTOR4
Length	82
Function	As part of the Ragulator complex it is involved in amino acid sensing and activation of mTORC1, a signaling complex promoting cell growth in response to growth factors, energy levels, and amino acids. Activated by amino acids through a mechanism involving the lysosomal V-ATPase, the Ragulator plays a dual role for the small GTPases Rag (RagA/RRAGA, RagB/RRAGB, RagC/RRAGC and/or RagD/RRAGD): it (1) acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), activating the small GTPases Rag and (2) mediates recruitment of Rag GTPases to the lysosome membrane. Activated Ragulator and Rag GTPases function as a scaffold recruiting mTORC1 to lysosomes where it is in turn activated.
