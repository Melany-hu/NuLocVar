Accession	P09132;B2R4E9;D6RCQ5;Q05D77;Q96FG6
EntryName	SRP19_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal recognition particle 19 kDa protein (SRP19)
GeneName	SRP19
Length	78
Function	Component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex, a ribonucleoprotein complex that mediates the cotranslational targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (By similarity). Binds directly to 7SL RNA (By similarity). Mediates binding of SRP54 to the SRP complex (By similarity).
