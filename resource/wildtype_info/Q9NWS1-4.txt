EntryName	PARI_HUMAN
ProteinName	PCNA-interacting partner (PARI) (PARP-1 binding protein) (PARP1-binding protein) (PARPBP)
GeneName	PARPBP C12orf48 PARI
Length	133
Function	Required to suppress inappropriate homologous recombination, thereby playing a central role DNA repair and in the maintenance of genomic stability. Antagonizes homologous recombination by interfering with the formation of the RAD51-DNA homologous recombination structure. Binds single-strand DNA and poly(A) homopolymers. Positively regulate the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity of PARP1; however such function may be indirect.
