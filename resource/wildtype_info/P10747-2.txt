EntryName	CD28_HUMAN
ProteinName	T-cell-specific surface glycoprotein CD28 (TP44) (CD antigen CD28)
GeneName	CD28
Length	101
Function	Receptor that plays a role in T-cell activation, proliferation, survival and the maintenance of immune homeostasis (PubMed:1650475, PubMed:7568038). Functions not only as an amplifier of TCR signals but delivers unique signals that control intracellular biochemical events that alter the gene expression program of T-cells (PubMed:24665965). Stimulation upon engagement of its cognate ligands CD80 or CD86 increases proliferation and expression of various cytokines in particular IL2 production in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell subsets (PubMed:1650475, PubMed:35397202). Mechanistically, ligation induces recruitment of protein kinase C-theta/PRKCQ and GRB2 leading to NF-kappa-B activation via both PI3K/Akt-dependent and -independent pathways (PubMed:21964608, PubMed:24665965, PubMed:7568038). In conjunction with TCR/CD3 ligation and CD40L costimulation, enhances the production of IL4 and IL10 in T-cells (PubMed:8617933).
