UniprotID	Q15388
Accession	Q15388;A8K195;Q498B3;Q6IBT4
EntryName	TOM20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM20 homolog (Mitochondrial 20 kDa outer membrane protein) (Outer mitochondrial membrane receptor Tom20)
GeneName	TOMM20 KIAA0016
Length	145
Function	Central component of the receptor complex responsible for the recognition and translocation of cytosolically synthesized mitochondrial preproteins. Together with TOM22 functions as the transit peptide receptor at the surface of the mitochondrion outer membrane and facilitates the movement of preproteins into the TOM40 translocation pore (By similarity). Required for the translocation across the mitochondrial outer membrane of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane
