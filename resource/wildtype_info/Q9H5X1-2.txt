Accession	Q9H5X1;A6NKS1;B2R5F8;B7Z8Z5
EntryName	CIA2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly component 2A (MIP18 family protein FAM96A)
GeneName	CIAO2A CIA2A FAM96A
Length	102
Function	Component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates the incorporation of iron-sulfur cluster into extramitochondrial Fe/S proteins (PubMed:23891004). As a CIA complex component and in collaboration with CIAO1 specifically matures ACO1 and stabilizes IREB2, connecting cytosolic iron-sulfur protein maturation with cellular iron regulation (PubMed:23891004). May play a role in chromosome segregation through establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. May induce apoptosis in collaboration with APAF1 (PubMed:25716227).
