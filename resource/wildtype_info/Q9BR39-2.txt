UniprotID	Q9BR39-2
Accession	Q9BR39;E1P5X1;O95913;Q5JY74;Q9UJN4
EntryName	JPH2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Junctophilin-2 (JP-2) (Junctophilin type 2) [Cleaved into: Junctophilin-2 N-terminal fragment (JP2NT)]
GeneName	JPH2 JP2
Length	129
Function	Membrane-binding protein that provides a structural bridge between the plasma membrane and the sarcoplasmic reticulum and is required for normal excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes (PubMed:20095964). Provides a structural foundation for functional cross-talk between the cell surface and intracellular Ca(2+) release channels by maintaining the 12-15 nm gap between the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes in the cardiac dyads (By similarity). Necessary for proper intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in cardiac myocytes via its involvement in ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium ion release (By similarity). Contributes to the construction of skeletal muscle triad junctions (By similarity).
