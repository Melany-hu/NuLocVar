EntryName	SH21A_HUMAN
ProteinName	SH2 domain-containing protein 1A (Duncan disease SH2-protein) (Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-associated protein) (SLAM-associated protein) (T-cell signal transduction molecule SAP)
GeneName	SH2D1A DSHP SAP
Length	128
Function	Cytoplasmic adapter regulating receptors of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family such as SLAMF1, CD244, LY9, CD84, SLAMF6 and SLAMF7. In SLAM signaling seems to cooperate with SH2D1B/EAT-2. Initially it has been proposed that association with SLAMF1 prevents SLAMF1 binding to inhibitory effectors including INPP5D/SHIP1 and PTPN11/SHP-2 (PubMed:11806999). However, by simultaneous interactions, recruits FYN which subsequently phosphorylates and activates SLAMF1 (PubMed:12458214). Positively regulates CD244/2B4- and CD84-mediated natural killer (NK) cell functions. Can also promote CD48-, SLAMF6 -, LY9-, and SLAMF7-mediated NK cell activation. In the context of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity enhances conjugate formation with target cells (By similarity). May also regulate the activity of the neurotrophin receptors NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3.
