UniprotID	Q9BX46-5
Accession	Q9BX46;E9PAY4;Q6QDA4;Q8N9D3;Q96NI3
EntryName	RBM24_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA-binding protein 24 (RNA-binding motif protein 24) (RNA-binding region-containing protein 6)
GeneName	RBM24 RNPC6
Length	178
Function	Multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability and mRNA translation important for cell fate decision and differentiation (PubMed:20977548, PubMed:24375645, PubMed:29104163, PubMed:29358667). Plays a major role in pre-mRNA alternative splicing regulation (PubMed:26990106, PubMed:29104163). Mediates preferentially muscle-specific exon inclusion in numerous mRNAs important for striated cardiac and skeletal muscle cell differentiation (PubMed:29104163). Binds to intronic splicing enhancer (ISE) composed of stretches of GU-rich motifs localized in flanking intron of exon that will be included by alternative splicing (By similarity). Involved in embryonic stem cell (ESC) transition to cardiac cell differentiation by promoting pre-mRNA alternative splicing events of several pluripotency and/or differentiation genes (PubMed:26990106). Plays a role in the regulation of mRNA stability (PubMed:20977548, PubMed:24356969, PubMed:24375645, PubMed:29104163). Binds to 3'-untranslated region (UTR) AU-rich elements in target transcripts, such as CDKN1A and MYOG, leading to maintain their stabilities (PubMed:20977548, PubMed:24356969). Involved in myogenic differentiation by regulating MYOG levels (PubMed:20977548). Binds to multiple regions in the mRNA 3'-UTR of TP63 isoform 2, hence inducing its destabilization (PubMed:24375645). Also promotes the destabilization of the CHRM2 mRNA via its binding to a region in the coding sequence (PubMed:29104163). Plays a role in the regulation of mRNA translation (PubMed:29358667). Mediates repression of p53/TP53 mRNA translation through its binding to U-rich element in the 3'-UTR, hence preventing EIF4E from binding to p53/TP53 mRNA and translation initiation (PubMed:29358667). Binds to a huge amount of mRNAs (PubMed:29104163). Required for embryonic heart development, sarcomer and M-band formation in striated muscles (By similarity). Together with RBM20, promotes the expression of short isoforms of PDLIM5/ENH in cardiomyocytes (By similarity).
