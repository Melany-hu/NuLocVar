UniprotID	Q6L8G9
Accession	Q6L8G9;A1L452
EntryName	KRA56_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 5-6 (Keratin-associated protein 5.6) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 5.6)
GeneName	KRTAP5-6 KAP5.6 KRTAP5.6
Length	129
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated protein (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
