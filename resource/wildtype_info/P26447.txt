UniprotID	P26447
Accession	P26447;A8K7R8;D3DV46;Q6ICP8
EntryName	S10A4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein S100-A4 (Calvasculin) (Metastasin) (Placental calcium-binding protein) (Protein Mts1) (S100 calcium-binding protein A4)
GeneName	S100A4 CAPL MTS1
Length	101
Function	Calcium-binding protein that plays a role in various cellular processes including motility, angiogenesis, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and autophagy (PubMed:16707441, PubMed:23752197, PubMed:30713770). Increases cell motility and invasiveness by interacting with non-muscle myosin heavy chain (NMMHC) IIA/MYH9 (PubMed:16707441). Mechanistically, promotes filament depolymerization and increases the amount of soluble myosin-IIA, resulting in the formation of stable protrusions facilitating chemotaxis (By similarity). Also modulates the pro-apoptotic function of TP53 by binding to its C-terminal transactivation domain within the nucleus and reducing its protein levels (PubMed:23752197). Within the extracellular space, stimulates cytokine production including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and CCL24 from T-lymphocytes (By similarity). In addition, stimulates T-lymphocyte chemotaxis by acting as a chemoattractant complex with PGLYRP1 that promotes lymphocyte migration via CCR5 and CXCR3 receptors (PubMed:26654597, PubMed:30713770).
