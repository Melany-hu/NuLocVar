UniprotID	P62942
Accession	P62942;D3DVW6;P20071;Q4VC47;Q6FGD9;Q6LEU3;Q9H103;Q9H566
EntryName	FKB1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP1A (PPIase FKBP1A) (EC 5.2.1.8) (12 kDa FK506-binding protein) (12 kDa FKBP) (FKBP-12) (Calstabin-1) (FK506-binding protein 1A) (FKBP-1A) (Immunophilin FKBP12) (Rotamase)
GeneName	FKBP1A FKBP1 FKBP12
Length	108
Function	Keeps in an inactive conformation TGFBR1, the TGF-beta type I serine/threonine kinase receptor, preventing TGF-beta receptor activation in absence of ligand. Recruits SMAD7 to ACVR1B which prevents the association of SMAD2 and SMAD3 with the activin receptor complex, thereby blocking the activin signal. May modulate the RYR1 calcium channel activity. PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane
