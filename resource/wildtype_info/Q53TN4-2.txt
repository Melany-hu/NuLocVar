Accession	Q53TN4;B2RE79;B4DWD7;Q6KC16;Q6KC17;Q6P147;Q6ZR51;Q9H0Q8;Q9H5G5
EntryName	CYBR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Plasma membrane ascorbate-dependent reductase CYBRD1 (EC 7.2.1.3) (Cytochrome b reductase 1) (Duodenal cytochrome b) (Ferric-chelate reductase 3)
GeneName	CYBRD1 DCYTB FRRS3
Length	157
Function	Plasma membrane reductase that uses cytoplasmic ascorbate as an electron donor to reduce extracellular Fe(3+) into Fe(2+) (PubMed:30272000). Probably functions in dietary iron absorption at the brush border of duodenal enterocytes by producing Fe(2+), the divalent form of iron that can be transported into enterocytes (PubMed:30272000). It is also able to reduce extracellular monodehydro-L-ascorbate and may be involved in extracellular ascorbate regeneration by erythrocytes in blood (PubMed:17068337). May also act as a ferrireductase in airway epithelial cells (Probable). May also function as a cupric transmembrane reductase (By similarity).
