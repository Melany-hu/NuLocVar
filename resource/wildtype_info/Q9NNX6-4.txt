EntryName	CD209_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD209 antigen (C-type lectin domain family 4 member L) (Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin 1) (DC-SIGN) (DC-SIGN1) (CD antigen CD209)
GeneName	CD209 CLEC4L
Length	168
Function	Pathogen-recognition receptor expressed on the surface of immature dendritic cells (DCs) and involved in initiation of primary immune response. Thought to mediate the endocytosis of pathogens which are subsequently degraded in lysosomal compartments. The receptor returns to the cell membrane surface and the pathogen-derived antigens are presented to resting T-cells via MHC class II proteins to initiate the adaptive immune response.
