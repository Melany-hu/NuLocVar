UniprotID	Q16695
Accession	Q16695;B2R5K3;Q6FGU4
EntryName	H31T_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H3.1t (H3/t) (H3t) (H3/g) (Histone H3.4)
GeneName	H3-4 H3FT HIST3H3
Length	136
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
