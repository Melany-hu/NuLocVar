UniprotID	Q9NWW9
Accession	Q9NWW9;B9A7L8
EntryName	PLAT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholipase A and acyltransferase 2 (EC 2.3.1.-) (EC 3.1.1.32) (EC 3.1.1.4) (HRAS-like suppressor 2)
GeneName	PLAAT2 HRASLS2
Length	162
Function	Exhibits both phospholipase A1/2 and acyltransferase activities (PubMed:19615464, PubMed:22605381, PubMed:22825852, PubMed:26503625). Shows phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and A2 (PLA2) activity, catalyzing the calcium-independent release of fatty acids from the sn-1 or sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids (PubMed:19615464, PubMed:22605381, PubMed:22825852). For most substrates, PLA1 activity is much higher than PLA2 activity (PubMed:19615464). Shows O-acyltransferase activity, catalyzing the transfer of a fatty acyl group from glycerophospholipid to the hydroxyl group of lysophospholipid (PubMed:19615464). Shows N-acyltransferase activity, catalyzing the calcium-independent transfer of a fatty acyl group at the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and other glycerophospholipids to the primary amine of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), forming N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), which serves as precursor for N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) (PubMed:19615464, PubMed:22605381, PubMed:22825852). Catalyzes N-acylation of PE using both sn-1 and sn-2 palmitoyl groups of PC as acyl donor (PubMed:22605381). Exhibits high phospholipase A1/2 activity and low N-acyltransferase activity (PubMed:22825852).
