UniprotID	O14625
Accession	O14625;Q53YA3;Q92840
EntryName	CXL11_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (Beta-R1) (H174) (Interferon gamma-inducible protein 9) (IP-9) (Interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant) (I-TAC) (Small-inducible cytokine B11)
GeneName	CXCL11 ITAC SCYB11 SCYB9B
Length	94
Function	Chemotactic for interleukin-activated T-cells but not unstimulated T-cells, neutrophils or monocytes. Induces calcium release in activated T-cells. Binds to CXCR3. May play an important role in CNS diseases which involve T-cell recruitment. May play a role in skin immune responses.
