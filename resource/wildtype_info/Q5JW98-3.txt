Accession	Q5JW98;B0QZ25;B0QZ27;B4DTQ0;Q96MK0
EntryName	CAHM4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium homeostasis modulator protein 4 (Protein FAM26D)
GeneName	CALHM4 C6orf78 FAM26D UNQ6481/PRO21277
Length	171
Function	May assemble to form gap junction channel-like structures involved in intercellular communication. Channel gating and ion conductance are likely regulated by membrane lipids rather than by membrane depolarization or extracellular calcium levels.
