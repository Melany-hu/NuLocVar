Function	Integral mitochondrial outer-membrane protein that mediates the formation of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) (PubMed:33972548). In turn, mediates angiogenesis and neoangiogenesis through interference with intracellular Ca(2+) communication and regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR/VEGFR2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels (PubMed:33972548). Also acts as an activator of hypoxia-induced mitophagy, an important mechanism for mitochondrial quality and homeostasis, by interacting with and recruiting LC3 protein family to mitochondria (PubMed:22267086, PubMed:24671035, PubMed:24746696, PubMed:27653272). Mechanistically, recruits DRP1 at ER-mitochondria contact sites leading to DRP1 oligomerization and GTPase activity to facilitate mitochondrial fission during hypoxia (PubMed:27145933, PubMed:33978709). Additionally, plays a role in hepatic ferroptosis by interacting directly with glutathione peroxidase/GPX4 to facilitate its recruitment into mitochondria through TOM/TIM complex where it is degraded by mitophagy (PubMed:36828120).
