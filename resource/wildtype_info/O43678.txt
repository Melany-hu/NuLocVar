UniprotID	O43678
Accession	O43678;D6RJD6;Q6IAY8
EntryName	NDUA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 2 (Complex I-B8) (CI-B8) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B8 subunit)
GeneName	NDUFA2
Length	99
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
