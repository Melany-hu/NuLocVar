UniprotID	P62952
Accession	P62952;A2A2K7;O60629;Q9D3B5
EntryName	BLCAP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Apoptosis inducing factor BLCAP (Bladder cancer 10 kDa protein) (Bc10) (Bladder cancer-associated protein)
GeneName	BLCAP BC10
Length	87
Function	Acts as a tumor suppressor; induces growth arrest at G(1)/S checkpoint and apoptosis via RB1-dependent and p53/TP53- and NF-kappa-B-independent mechanisms (PubMed:16675915, PubMed:17031575, PubMed:21844121, PubMed:26986503). Modulates expression of genes involved in the regulation of proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis (PubMed:17031575, PubMed:21844121, PubMed:26986503).
