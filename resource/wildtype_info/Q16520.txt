UniprotID	Q16520
Accession	Q16520
EntryName	BATF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor ATF-like (B-cell-activating transcription factor) (B-ATF) (SF-HT-activated gene 2 protein) (SFA-2)
GeneName	BATF
Length	125
Function	AP-1 family transcription factor that controls the differentiation of lineage-specific cells in the immune system: specifically mediates the differentiation of T-helper 17 cells (Th17), follicular T-helper cells (TfH), CD8(+) dendritic cells and class-switch recombination (CSR) in B-cells. Acts via the formation of a heterodimer with JUNB that recognizes and binds DNA sequence 5'-TGATCA-3'. The BATF-JUNB heterodimer also forms a complex with IRF4 (or IRF8) in immune cells, leading to recognition of AICE sequence (5'-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3'), an immune-specific regulatory element, followed by cooperative binding of BATF and IRF4 (or IRF8) and activation of genes. Controls differentiation of T-helper cells producing interleukin-17 (Th17 cells) by binding to Th17-associated gene promoters: regulates expression of the transcription factor RORC itself and RORC target genes such as IL17 (IL17A or IL17B). Also involved in differentiation of follicular T-helper cells (TfH) by directing expression of BCL6 and MAF. In B-cells, involved in class-switch recombination (CSR) by controlling the expression of both AICDA and of germline transcripts of the intervening heavy-chain region and constant heavy-chain region (I(H)-C(H)). Following infection, can participate in CD8(+) dendritic cell differentiation via interaction with IRF4 and IRF8 to mediate cooperative gene activation. Regulates effector CD8(+) T-cell differentiation by regulating expression of SIRT1. Following DNA damage, part of a differentiation checkpoint that limits self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs): up-regulated by STAT3, leading to differentiation of HSCs, thereby restricting self-renewal of HSCs (By similarity).
