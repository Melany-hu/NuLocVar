UniprotID	O14604
Accession	O14604;Q0VDA2
EntryName	TYB4Y_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thymosin beta-4, Y-chromosomal
GeneName	TMSB4Y TB4Y
Length	44
Function	Plays an important role in the organization of the cytoskeleton. Binds to and sequesters actin monomers (G actin) and therefore inhibits actin polymerization (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
