UniprotID	P07108-4
Accession	P07108;B8ZWD2;B8ZWD6;B8ZWD7;P08869;Q4VWZ6;Q53SQ7;Q6IB48;Q9UCI8
EntryName	ACBP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) (Diazepam-binding inhibitor) (DBI) (Endozepine) (EP)
GeneName	DBI
Length	129
Function	Binds medium- and long-chain acyl-CoA esters with very high affinity and may function as an intracellular carrier of acyl-CoA esters. It is also able to displace diazepam from the benzodiazepine (BZD) recognition site located on the GABA type A receptor. It is therefore possible that this protein also acts as a neuropeptide to modulate the action of the GABA receptor.
