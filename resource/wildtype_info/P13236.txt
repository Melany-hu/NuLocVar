UniprotID	P13236
Accession	P13236;P22617;Q13704;Q3SXL8;Q6FGI8
EntryName	CCL4_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 4 (G-26 T-lymphocyte-secreted protein) (HC21) (Lymphocyte activation gene 1 protein) (LAG-1) (MIP-1-beta(1-69)) (Macrophage inflammatory protein 1-beta) (MIP-1-beta) (PAT 744) (Protein H400) (SIS-gamma) (Small-inducible cytokine A4) (T-cell activation protein 2) (ACT-2) [Cleaved into: MIP-1-beta(3-69)]
GeneName	CCL4 LAG1 MIP1B SCYA4
Length	92
Function	Monokine with inflammatory and chemokinetic properties. Binds to CCR5. One of the major HIV-suppressive factors produced by CD8+ T-cells. Recombinant MIP-1-beta induces a dose-dependent inhibition of different strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The processed form MIP-1-beta(3-69) retains the abilities to induce down-modulation of surface expression of the chemokine receptor CCR5 and to inhibit the CCR5-mediated entry of HIV-1 in T-cells. MIP-1-beta(3-69) is also a ligand for CCR1 and CCR2 isoform B.
