UniprotID	K7EQG4
Accession	K7EQG4
EntryName	K7EQG4_HUMAN
ProteinName	FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator
GeneName	FXYD1
Length	115
Function	Associates with and regulates the activity of the sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase (NKA) which transports Na(+) out of the cell and K(+) into the cell. Inhibits NKA activity in its unphosphorylated state and stimulates activity when phosphorylated. Reduces glutathionylation of the NKA beta-1 subunit ATP1B1, thus reversing glutathionylation-mediated inhibition of ATP1B1. Contributes to female sexual development by maintaining the excitability of neurons which secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
