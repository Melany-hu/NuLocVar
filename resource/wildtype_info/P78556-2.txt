UniprotID	P78556-2
Accession	P78556;Q53S51;Q99664
EntryName	CCL20_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 20 (Beta-chemokine exodus-1) (CC chemokine LARC) (Liver and activation-regulated chemokine) (Macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha) (MIP-3-alpha) (Small-inducible cytokine A20) [Cleaved into: CCL20(1-67); CCL20(1-64); CCL20(2-70)]
GeneName	CCL20 LARC MIP3A SCYA20
Length	95
Function	Acts as a ligand for C-C chemokine receptor CCR6. Signals through binding and activation of CCR6 and induces a strong chemotactic response and mobilization of intracellular calcium ions (PubMed:11035086, PubMed:11352563, PubMed:20068036). The ligand-receptor pair CCL20-CCR6 is responsible for the chemotaxis of dendritic cells (DC), effector/memory T-cells and B-cells and plays an important role at skin and mucosal surfaces under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions, as well as in pathology, including cancer and various autoimmune diseases (PubMed:21376174). CCL20 acts as a chemotactic factor that attracts lymphocytes and, slightly, neutrophils, but not monocytes (PubMed:11352563, PubMed:9038201). Involved in the recruitment of both the pro-inflammatory IL17 producing helper T-cells (Th17) and the regulatory T-cells (Treg) to sites of inflammation. Required for optimal migration of thymic natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) and DN1 early thymocyte progenitor cells (By similarity). C-terminal processed forms have been shown to be equally chemotactically active for leukocytes (PubMed:11035086). Positively regulates sperm motility and chemotaxis via its binding to CCR6 which triggers Ca2+ mobilization in the sperm which is important for its motility (PubMed:23765988, PubMed:25122636). Inhibits proliferation of myeloid progenitors in colony formation assays (PubMed:9129037). May be involved in formation and function of the mucosal lymphoid tissues by attracting lymphocytes and dendritic cells towards epithelial cells (By similarity). Possesses antibacterial activity towards E.coli ATCC 25922 and S.aureus ATCC 29213 (PubMed:12149255).
