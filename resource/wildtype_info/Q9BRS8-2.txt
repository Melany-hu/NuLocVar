UniprotID	Q9BRS8-2
Accession	Q9BRS8;Q5XKE4;Q8N3N2;Q9NUR0
EntryName	LARP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	La-related protein 6 (Acheron) (Achn) (La ribonucleoprotein domain family member 6)
GeneName	LARP6
Length	93
Function	Regulates the coordinated translation of type I collagen alpha-1 and alpha-2 mRNAs, CO1A1 and CO1A2. Stabilizes mRNAs through high-affinity binding of a stem-loop structure in their 5' UTR. This regulation requires VIM and MYH10 filaments, and the helicase DHX9.
