UniprotID	P16619
Accession	P16619;A6NGK6;B2RUX4;Q3B7A8;Q53YA5;Q96I68
EntryName	CL3L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 3-like 1 (G0/G1 switch regulatory protein 19-2) (LD78-beta(1-70)) (PAT 464.2) (Small-inducible cytokine A3-like 1) (Tonsillar lymphocyte LD78 beta protein) [Cleaved into: LD78-beta(3-70); LD78-beta(5-70)]
GeneName	CCL3L1 D17S1718 G0S19-2 SCYA3L1; CCL3L3
Length	93
Function	Chemotactic for lymphocytes and monocytes. Is a ligand for CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5. Is an inhibitor of HIV-1-infection. The processed form LD78-beta(3-70) shows a 20-fold to 30-fold higher chemotactic activity and is a very potent inhibitor of HIV-1-infection. LD78-beta(3-70) is also a ligand for CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5.
