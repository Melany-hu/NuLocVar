EntryName	CD44_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD44 antigen (CDw44) (Epican) (Extracellular matrix receptor III) (ECMR-III) (GP90 lymphocyte homing/adhesion receptor) (HUTCH-I) (Heparan sulfate proteoglycan) (Hermes antigen) (Hyaluronate receptor) (Phagocytic glycoprotein 1) (PGP-1) (Phagocytic glycoprotein I) (PGP-I) (CD antigen CD44)
GeneName	CD44 LHR MDU2 MDU3 MIC4
Length	139
Function	Cell-surface receptor that plays a role in cell-cell interactions, cell adhesion and migration, helping them to sense and respond to changes in the tissue microenvironment (PubMed:16541107, PubMed:19703720, PubMed:22726066). Participates thereby in a wide variety of cellular functions including the activation, recirculation and homing of T-lymphocytes, hematopoiesis, inflammation and response to bacterial infection (PubMed:7528188). Engages, through its ectodomain, extracellular matrix components such as hyaluronan/HA, collagen, growth factors, cytokines or proteases and serves as a platform for signal transduction by assembling, via its cytoplasmic domain, protein complexes containing receptor kinases and membrane proteases (PubMed:18757307, PubMed:23589287). Such effectors include PKN2, the RhoGTPases RAC1 and RHOA, Rho-kinases and phospholipase C that coordinate signaling pathways promoting calcium mobilization and actin-mediated cytoskeleton reorganization essential for cell migration and adhesion (PubMed:15123640).
