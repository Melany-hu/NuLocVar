EntryName	SCP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP-2) (Acetyl-CoA C-myristoyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.155) (Non-specific lipid-transfer protein) (NSL-TP) (Propanoyl-CoA C-acyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.176) (SCP-2/3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase) (SCP-2/thiolase) (EC 2.3.1.16) (SCP-chi) (SCPX) (Sterol carrier protein X) (SCP-X)
GeneName	SCP2
Length	140
Function	Plays a crucial role in the peroxisomal oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids (PubMed:10706581). Catalyzes the last step of the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of branched chain fatty acids and the side chain of the bile acid intermediates di- and trihydroxycoprostanic acids (DHCA and THCA) (PubMed:10706581). Also active with medium and long straight chain 3-oxoacyl-CoAs. Stimulates the microsomal conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol and transfers phosphatidylcholine and 7-dehydrocholesterol between membrances, in vitro (By similarity). Isoforms SCP2 and SCPx cooperate in peroxisomal oxidation of certain naturally occurring tetramethyl-branched fatty acyl-CoAs (By similarity).
