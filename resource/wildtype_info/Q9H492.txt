UniprotID	Q9H492
Accession	Q9H492;E1P5P4;E1P5P5;Q9BXW5
EntryName	MLP3A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 alpha (Autophagy-related protein LC3 A) (Autophagy-related ubiquitin-like modifier LC3 A) (MAP1 light chain 3-like protein 1) (Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3A) (MAP1A/MAP1B LC3 A) (MAP1A/MAP1B light chain 3 A)
GeneName	MAP1LC3A
Length	121
Function	Ubiquitin-like modifier involved in formation of autophagosomal vacuoles (autophagosomes) (PubMed:20713600, PubMed:24290141). While LC3s are involved in elongation of the phagophore membrane, the GABARAP/GATE-16 subfamily is essential for a later stage in autophagosome maturation (PubMed:20713600). Through its interaction with the reticulophagy receptor TEX264, participates in the remodeling of subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum into autophagosomes upon nutrient stress, which then fuse with lysosomes for endoplasmic reticulum turnover (PubMed:31006537, PubMed:31006538).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome membrane; Endomembrane system; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
