UniprotID	Q9NWW0-2
Accession	Q9NWW0;D3DUA7;Q68EN7
EntryName	HPIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Host cell factor C1 regulator 1 (HCF-1 beta-propeller-interacting protein)
GeneName	HCFC1R1 HPIP
Length	119
Function	Regulates HCFC1 activity by modulating its subcellular localization. Overexpression of HCFC1R1 leads to accumulation of HCFC1 in the cytoplasm. HCFC1R1-mediated export may provide the pool of cytoplasmic HCFC1 required for import of virion-derived VP16 into the nucleus.
