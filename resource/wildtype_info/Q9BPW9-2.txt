EntryName	DHRS9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 9 (EC 1.1.1.209) (EC 1.1.1.53) (3-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) (3-alpha-HSD) (NADP-dependent retinol dehydrogenase/reductase) (RDH-E2) (RDHL) (Retinol dehydrogenase 15) (EC 1.1.1.105) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 4) (Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase retSDR8) (Tracheobronchial epithelial cell-specific retinol dehydrogenase) (RDH-TBE)
GeneName	DHRS9 RDH15 SDR9C4 UNQ835/PRO1773
Length	172
Function	3-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase that converts 3-alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone (allopregnanolone) to dihydroxyprogesterone and 3-alpha-androstanediol to dihydroxyprogesterone (PubMed:11294878, PubMed:29541409). Also plays a role in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid from retinaldehyde (PubMed:11304534, PubMed:12618084). Can utilize both NADH and NADPH.
