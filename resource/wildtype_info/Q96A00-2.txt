UniprotID	Q96A00-2
Accession	Q96A00;Q7Z4X7;Q96S54
EntryName	PP14A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 14A (17 kDa PKC-potentiated inhibitory protein of PP1) (Protein kinase C-potentiated inhibitor protein of 17 kDa) (CPI-17)
GeneName	PPP1R14A CPI17 PPP1INL
Length	120
Function	Inhibitor of PPP1CA. Has over 1000-fold higher inhibitory activity when phosphorylated, creating a molecular switch for regulating the phosphorylation status of PPP1CA substrates and smooth muscle contraction.
