UniprotID	P61604
Accession	P61604;O95421;Q04984;Q53X54;Q9UDH0
EntryName	CH10_HUMAN
ProteinName	10 kDa heat shock protein, mitochondrial (Hsp10) (10 kDa chaperonin) (Chaperonin 10) (CPN10) (Early-pregnancy factor) (EPF) (Heat shock protein family E member 1)
GeneName	HSPE1
Length	102
Function	Co-chaperonin implicated in mitochondrial protein import and macromolecular assembly. Together with Hsp60, facilitates the correct folding of imported proteins. May also prevent misfolding and promote the refolding and proper assembly of unfolded polypeptides generated under stress conditions in the mitochondrial matrix (PubMed:11422376, PubMed:1346131, PubMed:7912672). The functional units of these chaperonins consist of heptameric rings of the large subunit Hsp60, which function as a back-to-back double ring. In a cyclic reaction, Hsp60 ring complexes bind one unfolded substrate protein per ring, followed by the binding of ATP and association with 2 heptameric rings of the co-chaperonin Hsp10. This leads to sequestration of the substrate protein in the inner cavity of Hsp60 where, for a certain period of time, it can fold undisturbed by other cell components. Synchronous hydrolysis of ATP in all Hsp60 subunits results in the dissociation of the chaperonin rings and the release of ADP and the folded substrate protein (Probable).
