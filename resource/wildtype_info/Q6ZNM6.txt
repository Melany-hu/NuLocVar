UniprotID	Q6ZNM6
Accession	Q6ZNM6
EntryName	SMI10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sperm-associated microtubule inner protein 10 (Testis-expressed protein 43)
GeneName	SPMIP10 C5orf48 TEX43
Length	134
Function	Microtubule inner protein (MIP) part of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in flagellum axoneme, which is required for flagellum beating. May serve to reinforce and thus stabilize the microtubule structure in the sperm flagella. Involved in the regulation of sperm motility.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Flagellum axoneme
