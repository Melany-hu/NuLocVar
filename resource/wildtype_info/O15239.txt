UniprotID	O15239
Accession	O15239
EntryName	NDUA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 1 (Complex I-MWFE) (CI-MWFE) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase MWFE subunit)
GeneName	NDUFA1
Length	70
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
