EntryName	IL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-3 (IL-3) (Hematopoietic growth factor) (Mast cell growth factor) (MCGF) (Multipotential colony-stimulating factor) (P-cell-stimulating factor)
GeneName	IL3
Length	152
Function	Cytokine secreted predominantly by activated T-lymphocytes as well as mast cells and osteoblastic cells that controls the production and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into lineage-restricted cells (PubMed:2556442). Also stimulates mature basophils, eosinophils, and monocytes to become functionally activated (PubMed:10779277, PubMed:32889153). In addition, plays an important role in neural cell proliferation and survival (PubMed:23226269). Participates as well in bone homeostasis and inhibits osteoclast differentiation by preventing NF-kappa-B nuclear translocation and activation (PubMed:12816992). Mechanistically, exerts its biological effects through a receptor composed of IL3RA subunit and a signal transducing subunit IL3RB (PubMed:29374162). Receptor stimulation results in the rapid activation of JAK2 kinase activity leading to STAT5-mediated transcriptional program (By similarity). Alternatively, contributes to cell survival under oxidative stress in non-hematopoietic systems by activating pathways mediated by PI3K/AKT and ERK (PubMed:27862234).
