UniprotID	P81172
Accession	P81172;Q1HE14;Q9BY68
EntryName	HEPC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hepcidin (Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 1) (LEAP-1) (Putative liver tumor regressor) (PLTR) [Cleaved into: Hepcidin-25 (Hepc25); Hepcidin-20 (Hepc20)]
GeneName	HAMP HEPC LEAP1 UNQ487/PRO1003
Length	84
Function	Liver-produced hormone that constitutes the main circulating regulator of iron absorption and distribution across tissues. Acts by promoting endocytosis and degradation of ferroportin/SLC40A1, leading to the retention of iron in iron-exporting cells and decreased flow of iron into plasma (PubMed:22682227, PubMed:29237594, PubMed:32814342). Controls the major flows of iron into plasma: absorption of dietary iron in the intestine, recycling of iron by macrophages, which phagocytose old erythrocytes and other cells, and mobilization of stored iron from hepatocytes (PubMed:22306005).
