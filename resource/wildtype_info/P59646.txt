UniprotID	P59646
Accession	P59646;Q6UWZ1;Q7Z4M5
EntryName	FXYD4_HUMAN
ProteinName	FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 4
GeneName	FXYD4 UNQ526/PRO1069
Length	89
Function	Associates with and regulates the activity of the sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase (NKA) which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of Na(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane (By similarity). Increases the apparent affinity of the transporter for Na(+) and increases NKA activity (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Basolateral cell membrane
