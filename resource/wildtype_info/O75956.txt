UniprotID	O75956
Accession	O75956
EntryName	CDKA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-dependent kinase 2-associated protein 2 (CDK2-associated protein 2) (DOC-1-related protein) (DOC-1R)
GeneName	CDK2AP2 DOC1R
Length	126
Function	Acts as a component of the histone deacetylase NuRD complex which participates in the remodeling of chromatin (PubMed:33283408). Inhibits cell cycle G1/S phase transition by repressing CDK2 expression and activation; represses CDK2 activation by inhibiting its interaction with cyclin E and A (PubMed:23781148). Plays a role in regulating the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in maintaining cell survival during terminal differentiation of ESCs (By similarity). Regulates microtubule organization of metaphase II oocytes (By similarity).
