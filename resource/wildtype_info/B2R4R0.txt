UniprotID	B2R4R0
Accession	B2R4R0
EntryName	B2R4R0_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H4
GeneName	HIST1H4L HIST1H4J
Length	103
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
