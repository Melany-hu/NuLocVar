UniprotID	O75414-2
Accession	O75414;B4DGW7;B4DM99;Q53HM5;Q96E73;Q9BQ63
EntryName	NDK6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleoside diphosphate kinase 6 (NDK 6) (NDP kinase 6) (EC 2.7.4.6) (Inhibitor of p53-induced apoptosis-alpha) (IPIA-alpha) (nm23-H6)
GeneName	NME6
Length	119
Function	Major role in the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP. The ATP gamma phosphate is transferred to the NDP beta phosphate via a ping-pong mechanism, using a phosphorylated active-site intermediate. Inhibitor of p53-induced apoptosis.
