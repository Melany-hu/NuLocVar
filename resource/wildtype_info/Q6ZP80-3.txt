UniprotID	Q6ZP80-3
Accession	Q6ZP80;C9JML7;Q3B7B8;Q53TT9;Q6GMU0;Q8WW45;Q96NR4
EntryName	TM182_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 182
GeneName	TMEM182 UNQ6974/PRO21957
Length	110
Function	Negatively regulates myogenesis and skeletal muscle regeneration via its association with ITGB1 (By similarity). Modulates ITGB1 activation by decreasing ITGB1-LAMB1 interaction and inhibiting ITGB1-mediated intracellular signaling during myogenesis (By similarity).
