UniprotID	P25398
Accession	P25398;Q76M58
EntryName	RS12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein eS12 (40S ribosomal protein S12)
GeneName	RPS12
Length	132
Function	Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797). Subunit of the 40S ribosomal complex (By similarity).
