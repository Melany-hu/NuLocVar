UniprotID	P55000
Accession	P55000;Q53YJ6;Q6PUA6;Q92483
EntryName	SLUR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Secreted Ly-6/uPAR-related protein 1 (SLURP-1) (ARS component B) (ARS(component B)-81/S) (Anti-neoplastic urinary protein) (ANUP)
GeneName	SLURP1 ARS
Length	103
Function	Has an antitumor activity (PubMed:8742060). Was found to be a marker of late differentiation of the skin. Implicated in maintaining the physiological and structural integrity of the keratinocyte layers of the skin (PubMed:14721776, PubMed:17008884). In vitro down-regulates keratinocyte proliferation; the function may involve the proposed role as modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) activity. In vitro inhibits alpha-7-dependent nAChR currents in an allosteric manner (PubMed:14506129, PubMed:26905431). In T cells may be involved in regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling (PubMed:17286989). Seems to have an immunomodulatory function in the cornea (By similarity). The function may implicate a possible role as a scavenger receptor for PLAU thereby blocking PLAU-dependent functions of PLAUR such as in cell migration and proliferation (PubMed:25168896).
