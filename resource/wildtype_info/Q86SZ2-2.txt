UniprotID	Q86SZ2-2
Accession	Q86SZ2;B3KPS2;Q5JPD6;Q86U35;Q86X35
EntryName	TPC6B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trafficking protein particle complex subunit 6B (TRAPP complex subunit 6B)
GeneName	TRAPPC6B
Length	130
Function	Component of a transport protein particle (TRAPP) complex that may function in specific stages of inter-organelle traffic (PubMed:16025134, PubMed:16828797). Specifically involved in the early development of neural circuitry, likely by controlling the frequency and amplitude of intracellular calcium transients implicated in the regulation of neuron differentiation and survival (Probable).
