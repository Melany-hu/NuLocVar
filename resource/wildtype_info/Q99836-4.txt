EntryName	MYD88_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myeloid differentiation primary response protein MyD88
GeneName	MYD88
Length	146
Function	Adapter protein involved in the Toll-like receptor and IL-1 receptor signaling pathway in the innate immune response (PubMed:15361868, PubMed:18292575, PubMed:33718825, PubMed:37971847). Acts via IRAK1, IRAK2, IRF7 and TRAF6, leading to NF-kappa-B activation, cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response (PubMed:15361868, PubMed:19506249, PubMed:24316379). Increases IL-8 transcription (PubMed:9013863). Involved in IL-18-mediated signaling pathway. Activates IRF1 resulting in its rapid migration into the nucleus to mediate an efficient induction of IFN-beta, NOS2/INOS, and IL12A genes. Upon TLR8 activation by GU-rich single-stranded RNA (GU-rich RNA) derived from viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and HIV-1, induces IL1B release through NLRP3 inflammasome activation (PubMed:33718825). MyD88-mediated signaling in intestinal epithelial cells is crucial for maintenance of gut homeostasis and controls the expression of the antimicrobial lectin REG3G in the small intestine (By similarity).
