EntryName	MAAI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Maleylacetoacetate isomerase (MAAI) (EC 5.2.1.2) (GSTZ1-1) (Glutathione S-transferase zeta 1) (EC 2.5.1.18)
GeneName	GSTZ1 MAAI
Length	174
Function	Bifunctional enzyme showing minimal glutathione-conjugating activity with ethacrynic acid and 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole and maleylacetoacetate isomerase activity. Also has low glutathione peroxidase activity with T-butyl and cumene hydroperoxides. Is able to catalyze the glutathione dependent oxygenation of dichloroacetic acid to glyoxylic acid.
