UniprotID	Q99735
Accession	Q99735;D6RBB5;Q7Z5B8
EntryName	MGST2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Microsomal glutathione S-transferase 2 (Microsomal GST-2) (EC 2.5.1.18) (Glutathione peroxidase MGST2) (EC 1.11.1.-) (Leukotriene C4 synthase MGST2) (EC 4.4.1.20) (Microsomal glutathione S-transferase II) (Microsomal GST-II)
GeneName	MGST2 GST2
Length	147
Function	Catalyzes several different glutathione-dependent reactions (PubMed:23409838, PubMed:26066610, PubMed:26656251, PubMed:8703034, PubMed:9278457). Catalyzes the glutathione-dependent reduction of lipid hydroperoxides, such as 5-HPETE (PubMed:23409838, PubMed:9278457). Has glutathione transferase activity, toward xenobiotic electrophiles, such as 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) (PubMed:23409838, PubMed:8703034). Also catalyzes the conjugation of leukotriene A4 with reduced glutathione to form leukotriene C4 (LTC4) (PubMed:23409838, PubMed:26656251). Involved in oxidative DNA damage induced by ER stress and anticancer agents by activating LTC4 biosynthetic machinery in nonimmune cells (PubMed:26656251).
