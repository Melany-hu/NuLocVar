UniprotID	Q9BRU2
Accession	Q9BRU2;B3KSV2;Q96AT4
EntryName	TCAL7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription elongation factor A protein-like 7 (TCEA-like protein 7) (Transcription elongation factor S-II protein-like 7)
GeneName	TCEAL7
Length	100
Function	Plays a role in the negative regulation of NF-kappa-B signaling at the basal level by modulating transcriptional activity of NF-kappa-B on its target gene promoters. Associates with cyclin D1 promoter containing Myc E-box sequence and transcriptionally represses cyclin D1 expression. Regulates telomerase reverse transcriptase expression and telomerase activity in both ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres)and telomerase-positive cell lines.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
