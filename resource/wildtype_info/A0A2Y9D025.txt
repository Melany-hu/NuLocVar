EntryName	A0A2Y9D025_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 6 (Complex I-B14) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B14 subunit)
GeneName	NDUFA6
Length	154
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed to be not involved in catalysis. Required for proper complex I assembly. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
