UniprotID	Q6P5X5-2
Accession	Q6P5X5;A0A075B6P1;A8MTW6;D3DX18;F5H3A8;J3KNP9
EntryName	CV039_HUMAN
ProteinName	Synaptic plasticity regulator PANTS (Plasticity-associated neural transcript short)
GeneName	C22orf39
Length	80
Function	Negatively regulates long-term potentiation and modulates adult synaptic plasticity. Stabilizes the interaction of RTN4 isoform A/Nogo-A with its receptors, inhibiting clustering of postsynaptic AMPA receptors at synaptic sites. Upon neuronal stimulation, degraded at synapses, reducing RTN4 signaling and allowing AMPA receptor clustering at individual synapses.
Subcellular Location	Synapse; Synaptic cleft
