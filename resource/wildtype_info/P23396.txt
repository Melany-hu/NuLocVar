EntryName	RS3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein uS3 (40S ribosomal protein S3) (EC 4.2.99.18)
GeneName	RPS3 OK/SW-cl.26
Length	243
Function	Component of the small ribosomal subunit (PubMed:23636399, PubMed:8706699). The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:23636399, PubMed:8706699). Has endonuclease activity and plays a role in repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:7775413). Cleaves phosphodiester bonds of DNAs containing altered bases with broad specificity and cleaves supercoiled DNA more efficiently than relaxed DNA (PubMed:15707971). Displays high binding affinity for 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a common DNA lesion caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (PubMed:14706345). Has also been shown to bind with similar affinity to intact and damaged DNA (PubMed:18610840). Stimulates the N-glycosylase activity of the base excision protein OGG1 (PubMed:15518571). Enhances the uracil excision activity of UNG1 (PubMed:18973764). Also stimulates the cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone by APEX1 (PubMed:18973764). When located in the mitochondrion, reduces cellular ROS levels and mitochondrial DNA damage (PubMed:23911537). Has also been shown to negatively regulate DNA repair in cells exposed to hydrogen peroxide (PubMed:17049931). Plays a role in regulating transcription as part of the NF-kappa-B p65-p50 complex where it binds to the RELA/p65 subunit, enhances binding of the complex to DNA and promotes transcription of target genes (PubMed:18045535). Represses its own translation by binding to its cognate mRNA (PubMed:20217897). Binds to and protects TP53/p53 from MDM2-mediated ubiquitination (PubMed:19656744). Involved in spindle formation and chromosome movement during mitosis by regulating microtubule polymerization (PubMed:23131551). Involved in induction of apoptosis through its role in activation of CASP8 (PubMed:14988002). Induces neuronal apoptosis by interacting with the E2F1 transcription factor and acting synergistically with it to up-regulate pro-apoptotic proteins BCL2L11/BIM and HRK/Dp5 (PubMed:20605787). Interacts with TRADD following exposure to UV radiation and induces apoptosis by caspase-dependent JNK activation (PubMed:22510408).
