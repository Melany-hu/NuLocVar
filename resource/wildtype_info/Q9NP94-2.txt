UniprotID	Q9NP94-2
Accession	Q9NP94;B2RC76;G3V5X2;Q4QQJ1;Q4V9S4;Q96JT6;Q9UD20
EntryName	S39A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc transporter ZIP2 (6A1) (Eti-1) (Solute carrier family 39 member 2) (Zrt- and Irt-like protein 2) (ZIP-2) (hZIP2)
GeneName	SLC39A2 ZIP2
Length	85
Function	Transporter for the divalent cation Zn(2+) (PubMed:10681536, PubMed:29791142, PubMed:30914478). Mediates the influx of Zn(2+) into cells from extracellular space. The Zn(2+) uniporter activity is independent of H(+)-driving force, but is modulated by extracellular pH and membrane potential. Also transports other divalent cations Zn(2+), Cd2(+), Cu2(+), Co2(+) in the order of decreasing affinity, respectively (PubMed:29791142, PubMed:30914478). In the skin, aids in the differentiation of keratinocytes in the epidermis (By similarity).
