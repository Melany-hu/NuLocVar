UniprotID	D6RBV5
Accession	D6RBV5
EntryName	D6RBV5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complex III assembly factor LYRM7 (LYR motif-containing protein 7)
GeneName	LYRM7
Length	63
Function	Assembly factor required for Rieske Fe-S protein UQCRFS1 incorporation into the cytochrome b-c1 (CIII) complex. Functions as a chaperone, binding to this subunit within the mitochondrial matrix and stabilizing it prior to its translocation and insertion into the late CIII dimeric intermediate within the mitochondrial inner membrane.
