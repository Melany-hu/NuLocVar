UniprotID	A0A8Q3WLE6
Accession	A0A8Q3WLE6
EntryName	A0A8Q3WLE6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complement factor D (EC 3.4.21.46) (Adipsin) (C3 convertase activator) (Properdin factor D)
GeneName	CFD
Length	128
Function	Factor D cleaves factor B when the latter is complexed with factor C3b, activating the C3bbb complex, which then becomes the C3 convertase of the alternate pathway. Its function is homologous to that of C1s in the classical pathway.
