UniprotID	E9PC20
Accession	E9PC20
EntryName	E9PC20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Receptor activity-modifying protein 1
GeneName	RAMP1
Length	126
Function	Accessory protein that interacts with and modulates the function of G-protein coupled receptors including calcitonin gene-related peptide type 1 receptor (CALCRL) and calcitonin receptor (CALCR). Required for the transport of CALCRL to the plasma membrane. Together with CALCRL, form the receptor complex for the calcitonin gene-related peptides CGRP1/CALCA and CGRP2/CALCB. Together with CALCR, form the AMYR1 receptor complex for amylin/IAPP and CGRP1/CALCA.
