Accession	Q6UX40;A0PJV7;Q6NSE3;Q6ZRX9;Q96T82
EntryName	TM107_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 107
GeneName	TMEM107 DC20 UNQ638/PRO1268
Length	139
Function	Plays a role in cilia formation and embryonic patterning. Requires for normal Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in the neural tube and acts in combination with GLI2 and GLI3 to pattern ventral and intermediate neuronal cell types (By similarity). During ciliogenesis regulates the ciliary transition zone localization of some MKS complex proteins (PubMed:26518474).
