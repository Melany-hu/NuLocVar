UniprotID	H7C1Z1
Accession	H7C1Z1
EntryName	H7C1Z1_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-azacytidine-induced protein 2
GeneName	AZI2
Length	76
Function	Adapter protein which binds TBK1 and IKBKE playing a role in antiviral innate immunity. Activates serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1 and facilitates its oligomerization. Enhances the phosphorylation of NF-kappa-B p65 subunit RELA by TBK1. Promotes TBK1-induced as well as TNF-alpha or PMA-induced activation of NF-kappa-B. Participates in IFNB promoter activation via TICAM1.
