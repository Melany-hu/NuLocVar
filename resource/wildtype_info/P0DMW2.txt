UniprotID	P0DMW2
Accession	P0DMW2
EntryName	PYDC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	NLR family pyrin domain-containing protein 2B (Pyrin domain-containing protein 2-like protein POP4) (Pyrin-only protein 4)
GeneName	NLRP2B CLRX.1 NLRP2P NOD24 POP4
Length	45
Function	May function as a negative regulator of NF-kappa-B by preventing RELA/p65 phosphorylation at 'Ser-536', thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity. Through NF-kappa-B regulation may control cytokine release upon Toll-like receptors activation and therefore play a role in modulation of innate immunity. May also play a role in cell cycle progression and apoptotic process.
