UniprotID	F8W6G9
Accession	F8W6G9
EntryName	F8W6G9_HUMAN
ProteinName	peptidylprolyl isomerase (EC 5.2.1.8)
GeneName	FKBP1B
Length	79
Function	Has the potential to contribute to the immunosuppressive and toxic effects of FK506 and rapamycin. PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides.
