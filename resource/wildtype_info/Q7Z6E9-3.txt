EntryName	RBBP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RBBP6 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Proliferation potential-related protein) (Protein P2P-R) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase RBBP6) (Retinoblastoma-binding Q protein 1) (RBQ-1) (Retinoblastoma-binding protein 6) (p53-associated cellular protein of testis)
GeneName	RBBP6 P2PR PACT RBQ1 My038
Length	118
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which promotes ubiquitination of YBX1, leading to its degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:18851979). May play a role as a scaffold protein to promote the assembly of the p53/TP53-MDM2 complex, resulting in increase of MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53/TP53; may function as negative regulator of p53/TP53, leading to both apoptosis and cell growth (By similarity). Regulates DNA-replication and the stability of chromosomal common fragile sites (CFSs) in a ZBTB38- and MCM10-dependent manner. Controls ZBTB38 protein stability and abundance via ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and ZBTB38 in turn negatively regulates the expression of MCM10 which plays an important role in DNA-replication (PubMed:24726359).
