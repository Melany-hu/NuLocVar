UniprotID	Q9UII2
Accession	Q9UII2;Q5JXL8;Q6IAQ7;Q9BSL9
EntryName	ATIF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATPase inhibitor, mitochondrial (ATP synthase F1 subunit epsilon) (Inhibitor of F(1)F(o)-ATPase) (IF(1)) (IF1)
GeneName	ATP5IF1 ATPI ATPIF1
Length	106
Function	Endogenous F(1)F(o)-ATPase inhibitor limiting ATP depletion when the mitochondrial membrane potential falls below a threshold and the F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase starts hydrolyzing ATP to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix. Required to avoid the consumption of cellular ATP when the F(1)F(o)-ATP synthase enzyme acts as an ATP hydrolase. Indirectly acts as a regulator of heme synthesis in erythroid tissues: regulates heme synthesis by modulating the mitochondrial pH and redox potential, allowing FECH to efficiently catalyze the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX to produce heme.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
