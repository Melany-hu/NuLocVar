UniprotID	Q30KQ6
Accession	Q30KQ6;Q8NES9
EntryName	DB114_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-defensin 114 (Beta-defensin 14) (DEFB-14) (Defensin, beta 114)
GeneName	DEFB114 DEFB14
Length	69
Function	Has a salt-sensitive antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including E.coli, Gram-positive, including S.aureus, and fungi, including C.albicans. Binds to and neutralizes bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), abolishing TNF production by macrophages challenged with LPS. Rescues the LPS-induced reduction of sperm motility in vitro and may protect from LPS-induced lethality.
