UniprotID	O95168-2
Accession	O95168;B2RUY3;B9EJC7
EntryName	NDUB4_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 4 (Complex I-B15) (CI-B15) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B15 subunit)
GeneName	NDUFB4
Length	120
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
