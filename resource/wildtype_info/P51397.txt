UniprotID	P51397
Accession	P51397;Q6FGC3;Q9BUC9
EntryName	DAP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Death-associated protein 1 (DAP-1)
GeneName	DAP DAP1
Length	102
Function	Ribosome-binding protein involved in ribosome hibernation, a process during which ribosomes are stabilized in an inactive state and preserved from proteasomal degradation (By similarity). Acts via its association with eiF5a (EIF5A and EIF5A2) at the polypeptide exit tunnel of the ribosome, preventing mRNA translation (By similarity). Involved in ribosome hibernation in the mature oocyte by preventing mRNA translation, leading to ribosome inactivation (By similarity). Ribosomes, which are produced in large quantities during oogenesis, are stored and translationally repressed in the oocyte and early embryo (By similarity). Also acts as a negative regulator of autophagy (PubMed:20537536). Involved in mediating interferon-gamma-induced cell death (PubMed:7828849).
