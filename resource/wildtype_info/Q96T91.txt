UniprotID	Q96T91
Accession	Q96T91;Q52LE2
EntryName	GPHA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycoprotein hormone alpha-2 (Putative secreted protein Zsig51) (Thyrostimulin subunit alpha)
GeneName	GPHA2 GPA2 ZSIG51
Length	129
Function	Functions as a heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone with GPHB5 able to bind and activate the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), leading to increased cAMP production (PubMed:12045258). Plays a central role in controlling thyroid cell metabolism (PubMed:12045258).
