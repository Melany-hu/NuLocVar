EntryName	HELQ_HUMAN
ProteinName	Helicase POLQ-like (EC 3.6.4.12) (Mus308-like helicase) (POLQ-like helicase)
GeneName	HELQ HEL308
Length	136
Function	Single-stranded 3'-5' DNA helicase that plays a key role in homology-driven double-strand break (DSB) repair (PubMed:11751861, PubMed:19995904, PubMed:21398521, PubMed:24005041, PubMed:24005565, PubMed:34316696, PubMed:34937945). Involved in different DSB repair mechanisms that are guided by annealing of extensive stretches of complementary bases at break ends, such as microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), single-strand annealing (SSA) or synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) (PubMed:34937945). Possesses both DNA unwinding and annealing activities (PubMed:34937945). Forms a complex with RAD51, stimulating HELQ DNA helicase activity and ability to unwing DNA (PubMed:34937945). Efficiently unwinds substrates containing 3' overhangs or a D-loop (PubMed:21398521, PubMed:34937945). In contrast, interaction with the replication protein A (RPA/RP-A) complex inhibits DNA unwinding by HELQ but strongly stimulates DNA strand annealing (PubMed:34937945). Triggers displacement of RPA from single-stranded DNA to facilitate annealing of complementary sequences (PubMed:34316696, PubMed:34937945).
