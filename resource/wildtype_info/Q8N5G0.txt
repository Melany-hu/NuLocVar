UniprotID	Q8N5G0
Accession	Q8N5G0;C9JYT8;Q9BRT5
EntryName	SIM20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small integral membrane protein 20 (Mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase protein of 7 kDa) (MITRAC7) [Cleaved into: Phoenixin-14 (PNX-14); Phoenixin-20 (PNX-20)]
GeneName	SMIM20 C4orf52 MITRAC7
Length	67
Function	Component of the MITRAC (mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase complex) complex, that regulates cytochrome c oxidase assembly (PubMed:26321642). Promotes the progression of complex assembly after the association of MT-CO1/COX1 with COX4I1 and COX6C (PubMed:26321642). Chaperone-like assembly factor required to stabilize newly synthesized MT-CO1/COX1 and to prevent its premature turnover (PubMed:26321642).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Secreted; Secreted
