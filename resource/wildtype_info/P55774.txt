UniprotID	P55774
Accession	P55774;B5BUM2;Q53X71
EntryName	CCL18_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 18 (Alternative macrophage activation-associated CC chemokine 1) (AMAC-1) (CC chemokine PARC) (Dendritic cell chemokine 1) (DC-CK1) (Macrophage inflammatory protein 4) (MIP-4) (Pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine) (Small-inducible cytokine A18) [Cleaved into: CCL18(1-68); CCL18(3-69); CCL18(4-69)]
GeneName	CCL18 AMAC1 DCCK1 MIP4 PARC SCYA18
Length	89
Function	Chemotactic factor that attracts lymphocytes but not monocytes or granulocytes. May be involved in B-cell migration into B-cell follicles in lymph nodes. Attracts naive T-lymphocytes toward dendritic cells and activated macrophages in lymph nodes, has chemotactic activity for naive T-cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and thus may play a role in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity responses.
