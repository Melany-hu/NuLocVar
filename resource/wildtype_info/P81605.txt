EntryName	DCD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dermcidin (EC 3.4.-.-) (Preproteolysin) [Cleaved into: Survival-promoting peptide; DCD-1]
GeneName	DCD AIDD DSEP
Length	110
Function	Found in sweat, has an antimicrobial activity during early bacterial colonization (PubMed:11694882, PubMed:23426625). The secreted peptide assembles into homohexameric complexes that can associate with and also insert into pathogen membranes (PubMed:23426625). Once inserted in bacteria membranes forms anion channels probably altering the transmembrane potential essential for bacterial survival (PubMed:23426625). Highly effective against E.coli, E.faecalis, S.aureus and C.albicans (PubMed:11694882). Optimal pH and salt concentration resemble the conditions in sweat (PubMed:11694882). Also exhibits proteolytic activity, cleaving on the C-terminal side of Arg and, to a lesser extent, Lys residues (PubMed:17448443).
