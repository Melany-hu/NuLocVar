UniprotID	A0A1W2PPG7
Accession	A0A1W2PPG7
EntryName	GBG14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Putative guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(O) subunit gamma-14
GeneName	GNG14
Length	69
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
