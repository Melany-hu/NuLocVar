UniprotID	A9XXE1
Accession	A9XXE1
EntryName	A9XXE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-synuclein
GeneName	SNCG
Length	79
Function	Plays a role in neurofilament network integrity. May be involved in modulating axonal architecture during development and in the adult. In vitro, increases the susceptibility of neurofilament-H to calcium-dependent proteases. May also function in modulating the keratin network in skin. Activates the MAPK and Elk-1 signal transduction pathway.
