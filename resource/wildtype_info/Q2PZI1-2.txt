UniprotID	Q2PZI1-2
Accession	Q2PZI1;O94954;Q4G151
EntryName	D19L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein C-mannosyl-transferase DPY19L1 (EC 2.4.1.-) (Dpy-19-like protein 1) (Protein dpy-19 homolog 1)
GeneName	DPY19L1 GA0500 KIAA0877
Length	85
Function	C-mannosyltransferase that mediates the C-mannosylation tryptophan residues on target proteins. The reaction occurs on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum and involves the transfer of a mannose unit from a dolichylphosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) donor to an acceptor protein containing a WxxW consensus sequence (By similarity). C-mannosylates the first two tryptophans in the WxxWxxWxxC motif in thrombospondin (TSP) type-1 of UNC5A (By similarity). Regulates neurite extension during development (By similarity).
