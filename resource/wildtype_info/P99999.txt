UniprotID	P99999
Accession	P99999;A4D166;B2R4I1;P00001;Q6NUR2;Q6NX69;Q96BV4
EntryName	CYC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome c
GeneName	CYCS CYC
Length	105
Function	Electron carrier protein. The oxidized form of the cytochrome c heme group can accept an electron from the heme group of the cytochrome c1 subunit of cytochrome reductase. Cytochrome c then transfers this electron to the cytochrome oxidase complex, the final protein carrier in the mitochondrial electron-transport chain.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion intermembrane space
