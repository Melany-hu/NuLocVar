UniprotID	Q8TDH9-3
Accession	Q8TDH9;B4DVM2;Q0VDJ6;Q0VDJ7;Q5THS1;Q68D56;Q8N5F9;Q9NU16
EntryName	BL1S5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 subunit 5 (BLOC-1 subunit 5) (Protein Muted homolog)
GeneName	BLOC1S5 MUTED
Length	123
Function	Component of the BLOC-1 complex, a complex that is required for normal biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LRO), such as platelet dense granules and melanosomes (PubMed:32565547). In concert with the AP-3 complex, the BLOC-1 complex is required to target membrane protein cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals. The BLOC-1 complex, in association with SNARE proteins, is also proposed to be involved in neurite extension. Plays a role in intracellular vesicle trafficking.
