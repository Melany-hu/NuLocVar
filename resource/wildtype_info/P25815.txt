UniprotID	P25815
Accession	P25815;Q5J7W2
EntryName	S100P_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein S100-P (Migration-inducing gene 9 protein) (MIG9) (Protein S100-E) (S100 calcium-binding protein P)
GeneName	S100P S100E
Length	95
Function	May function as calcium sensor and contribute to cellular calcium signaling. In a calcium-dependent manner, functions by interacting with other proteins, such as EZR and PPP5C, and indirectly plays a role in physiological processes like the formation of microvilli in epithelial cells. May stimulate cell proliferation in an autocrine manner via activation of the receptor for activated glycation end products (RAGE).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cell projection; Microvillus membrane
