EntryName	PIN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (EC 5.2.1.8) (Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Pin1) (PPIase Pin1) (Rotamase Pin1)
GeneName	PIN1
Length	163
Function	Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) that binds to and isomerizes specific phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro (pSer/Thr-Pro) motifs (PubMed:21497122, PubMed:23623683, PubMed:29686383). By inducing conformational changes in a subset of phosphorylated proteins, acts as a molecular switch in multiple cellular processes (PubMed:21497122, PubMed:22033920, PubMed:23623683). Displays a preference for acidic residues located N-terminally to the proline bond to be isomerized. Regulates mitosis presumably by interacting with NIMA and attenuating its mitosis-promoting activity. Down-regulates kinase activity of BTK (PubMed:16644721). Can transactivate multiple oncogenes and induce centrosome amplification, chromosome instability and cell transformation. Required for the efficient dephosphorylation and recycling of RAF1 after mitogen activation (PubMed:15664191). Binds and targets PML and BCL6 for degradation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (PubMed:17828269). Acts as a regulator of JNK cascade by binding to phosphorylated FBXW7, disrupting FBXW7 dimerization and promoting FBXW7 autoubiquitination and degradation: degradation of FBXW7 leads to subsequent stabilization of JUN (PubMed:22608923). May facilitate the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of RBBP8/CtIP through CUL3/KLHL15 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, hence favors DNA double-strand repair through error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) over error-free, RBBP8-mediated homologous recombination (HR) (PubMed:23623683, PubMed:27561354). Upon IL33-induced lung inflammation, catalyzes cis-trans isomerization of phosphorylated IRAK3/IRAK-M, inducing IRAK3 stabilization, nuclear translocation and expression of pro-inflammatory genes in dendritic cells (PubMed:29686383). Catalyzes cis-trans isomerization of phosphorylated phosphoglycerate kinase PGK1 under hypoxic conditions to promote its binding to the TOM complex and targeting to the mitochondrion (PubMed:26942675).
