UniprotID	Q02325
Accession	Q02325;Q580R1
EntryName	PLGB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Plasminogen-like protein B (Plasminogen-related protein B)
GeneName	PLGLB1 PLGL PRGB; PLGLB2 PLGP1
Length	96
Function	May bind noncovalently to lysine binding sites present in the kringle structures of plasminogen. This may interfere with the binding of fibrin or alpha-2-antiplasmin to plasminogen and may result in the localization of activity at sites necessary for extracellular matrix destruction.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
