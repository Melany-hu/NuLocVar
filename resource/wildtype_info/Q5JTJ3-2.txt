UniprotID	Q5JTJ3-2
Accession	Q5JTJ3;Q5JTJ2;Q5JTJ4;Q8TA88
EntryName	COA6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 6 homolog
GeneName	COA6 C1orf31
Length	155
Function	Involved in the maturation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV subunit MT-CO2/COX2. Thereby, may regulate early steps of complex IV assembly. Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV or cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from intermembrane space cytochrome c to molecular oxygen in the matrix and as a consequence contributes to the proton gradient involved in mitochondrial ATP synthesis. May also be required for efficient formation of respiratory supercomplexes comprised of complexes III and IV.
