EntryName	HG2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	HLA class II histocompatibility antigen gamma chain (HLA-DR antigens-associated invariant chain) (Ia antigen-associated invariant chain) (Ii) (CD antigen CD74) [Cleaved into: Class-II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP)]
GeneName	CD74 DHLAG
Length	160
Function	Plays a critical role in MHC class II antigen processing by stabilizing peptide-free class II alpha/beta heterodimers in a complex soon after their synthesis and directing transport of the complex from the endoplasmic reticulum to the endosomal/lysosomal system where the antigen processing and binding of antigenic peptides to MHC class II takes place. Serves as cell surface receptor for the cytokine MIF.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network; Endosome; Lysosome; Secreted; Late endosome; Lysosome
