UniprotID	Q9Y4Y9-2
Accession	Q9Y4Y9
EntryName	LSM5_HUMAN
ProteinName	U6 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein LSm5
GeneName	LSM5
Length	62
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing as component of the U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP complex that is involved in spliceosome assembly, and as component of the precatalytic spliceosome (spliceosome B complex) (PubMed:28781166). The heptameric LSM2-8 complex binds specifically to the 3'-terminal U-tract of U6 snRNA (PubMed:10523320).
