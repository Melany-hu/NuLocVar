EntryName	NDUAD_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 13 (Cell death regulatory protein GRIM-19) (Complex I-B16.6) (CI-B16.6) (Gene associated with retinoic and interferon-induced mortality 19 protein) (GRIM-19) (Gene associated with retinoic and IFN-induced mortality 19 protein) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B16.6 subunit)
GeneName	NDUFA13 GRIM19 CDA016 CGI-39
Length	144
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis (PubMed:27626371). Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone (PubMed:27626371). Involved in the interferon/all-trans-retinoic acid (IFN/RA) induced cell death. This apoptotic activity is inhibited by interaction with viral IRF1. Prevents the transactivation of STAT3 target genes. May play a role in CARD15-mediated innate mucosal responses and serve to regulate intestinal epithelial cell responses to microbes (PubMed:15753091).
