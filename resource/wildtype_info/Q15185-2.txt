UniprotID	Q15185-2
Accession	Q15185;A8K7D0;B4DHP2;B4DP11;B4DP21;Q8WU70
EntryName	TEBP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostaglandin E synthase 3 (EC 5.3.99.3) (Cytosolic prostaglandin E2 synthase) (cPGES) (Hsp90 co-chaperone) (Progesterone receptor complex p23) (Telomerase-binding protein p23)
GeneName	PTGES3 P23 TEBP
Length	127
Function	Cytosolic prostaglandin synthase that catalyzes the oxidoreduction of prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (PubMed:10922363). Molecular chaperone that localizes to genomic response elements in a hormone-dependent manner and disrupts receptor-mediated transcriptional activation, by promoting disassembly of transcriptional regulatory complexes (PubMed:11274138, PubMed:12077419). Facilitates HIF alpha proteins hydroxylation via interaction with EGLN1/PHD2, leading to recruit EGLN1/PHD2 to the HSP90 pathway (PubMed:24711448).
