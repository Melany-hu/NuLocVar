UniprotID	P0DMT0
Accession	P0DMT0
EntryName	MLN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myoregulin
GeneName	MRLN MLN
Length	46
Function	Inhibits the activity of ATP2A1/SERCA1 ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum by decreasing the apparent affinity of the ATPase for Ca(2+), thereby acting as a key regulator of skeletal muscle activity. Its high expression in adult skeletal muscle, suggests that it constitutes the predominant regulator of ATP2A1/SERCA1 in adult skeletal muscle. Also inhibits the activity of ATP2A2/SERCA2 and ATP2A3/SERCA3.
Subcellular Location	Sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane
