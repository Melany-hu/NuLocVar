UniprotID	C9JF99
Accession	C9JF99
EntryName	C9JF99_HUMAN
ProteinName	WW domain binding protein VOPP1 (EGFR-coamplified and overexpressed protein) (Vesicular, overexpressed in cancer, prosurvival protein 1)
GeneName	VOPP1
Length	85
Function	Increases the transcriptional activity of NFKB1 by facilitating its nuclear translocation, DNA-binding and associated apoptotic response, when overexpressed. May sequester WWOX in lysosomal vesicles and thereby regulate WWOX role as tumor suppressor.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Late endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane
