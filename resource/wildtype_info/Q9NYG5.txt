EntryName	APC11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 11 (APC11) (Cyclosome subunit 11) (Hepatocellular carcinoma-associated RING finger protein)
GeneName	ANAPC11 HSPC214
Length	84
Function	Together with the cullin protein ANAPC2, constitutes the catalytic component of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis and the G1 phase of the cell cycle (PubMed:11739784, PubMed:18485873). The APC/C complex acts by mediating ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins: it mainly mediates the formation of 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitin chains and, to a lower extent, the formation of 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:11739784, PubMed:18485873). The APC/C complex catalyzes assembly of branched 'Lys-11'-/'Lys-48'-linked branched ubiquitin chains on target proteins (PubMed:29033132). May recruit the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to the complex (PubMed:11739784, PubMed:18485873).
