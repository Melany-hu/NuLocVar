UniprotID	Q6NZ36-6
Accession	Q6NZ36;A6PW39;A6PW40;A6PW41;A8MQT6;F2Z2L4;Q6ZT64;Q71M24;Q96ND7
EntryName	FAP20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fanconi anemia core complex-associated protein 20 (FANCA-associated protein of 20 kDa) (Fanconi anemia-associated protein of 20 kDa)
GeneName	FAAP20 C1orf86 FP7162
Length	112
Function	Component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) complex required to recruit the FA complex to DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) and promote ICLs repair. Following DNA damage recognizes and binds 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin generated by RNF8 at ICLs and recruits other components of the FA complex. Promotes translesion synthesis via interaction with REV1.
