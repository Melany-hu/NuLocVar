UniprotID	Q96HA8-2
Accession	Q96HA8;B4DE68;Q9NW95
EntryName	NTAQ1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein N-terminal glutamine amidohydrolase (EC 3.5.1.122) (Protein NH2-terminal glutamine deamidase) (N-terminal Gln amidase) (Nt(Q)-amidase) (WDYHV motif-containing protein 1)
GeneName	NTAQ1 C8orf32 WDYHV1
Length	145
Function	Mediates the side-chain deamidation of N-terminal glutamine residues to glutamate, an important step in N-end rule pathway of protein degradation. Conversion of the resulting N-terminal glutamine to glutamate renders the protein susceptible to arginylation, polyubiquitination and degradation as specified by the N-end rule. Does not act on substrates with internal or C-terminal glutamine and does not act on non-glutamine residues in any position. Does not deaminate acetylated N-terminal glutamine. With the exception of proline, all tested second-position residues on substrate peptides do not greatly influence the activity. In contrast, a proline at position 2, virtually abolishes deamidation of N-terminal glutamine.
