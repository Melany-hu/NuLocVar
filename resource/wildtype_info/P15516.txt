Function	Histatins are cationic and histidine-rich peptides mainly found in the saliva of higher primates (PubMed:3286634). They are considered to be major precursors of the protective proteinaceous structure on tooth surfaces (enamel pellicle). Hsts can be divided into two major groups according to their biological functions: antimicrobial Hsts (e.g. Hst 5/HTN3) and cell-activating Hsts (e.g. Hst 1/HTN1, Hst 2/HTN1 and Hst 3/HTN3) (PubMed:32225006).
