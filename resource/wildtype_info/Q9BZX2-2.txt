UniprotID	Q9BZX2-2
Accession	Q9BZX2;Q5VV91;Q7KZV3;Q92528;Q96KG5;Q9BU42
EntryName	UCK2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK 2) (EC 2.7.1.48) (Cytidine monophosphokinase 2) (Testis-specific protein TSA903) (Uridine monophosphokinase 2)
GeneName	UCK2 UMPK
Length	111
Function	Phosphorylates uridine and cytidine to uridine monophosphate and cytidine monophosphate (PubMed:11306702, PubMed:11494055). Does not phosphorylate deoxyribonucleosides or purine ribonucleosides (PubMed:11306702). Can use ATP or GTP as a phosphate donor (PubMed:11306702). Can also phosphorylate cytidine and uridine nucleoside analogs such as 6-azauridine, 5-fluorouridine, 4-thiouridine, 5-bromouridine, N(4)-acetylcytidine, N(4)-benzoylcytidine, 5-fluorocytidine, 2-thiocytidine, 5-methylcytidine, and N(4)-anisoylcytidine (PubMed:11306702).
