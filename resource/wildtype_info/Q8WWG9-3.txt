UniprotID	Q8WWG9-3
Accession	Q8WWG9;A5H1P5;B7Z275;Q53SM4;Q96CC4
EntryName	KCNE4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 4 (MinK-related peptide 3) (MiRP3) (Minimum potassium ion channel-related peptide 3) (Potassium channel subunit beta MiRP3)
GeneName	KCNE4
Length	170
Function	Ancillary protein that functions as a regulatory subunit of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel complex composed of pore-forming and potassium-conducting alpha subunits and of regulatory beta subunits. KCNE4 beta subunit modulates the gating kinetics and enhances stability of the channel complex (PubMed:12096056, PubMed:19687231, PubMed:20533308, PubMed:27162025). Associates with KCNQ1/KVLTQ1 alpha subunit to inhibit potassium currents (PubMed:12096056, PubMed:19687231, PubMed:20533308, PubMed:27162025).
