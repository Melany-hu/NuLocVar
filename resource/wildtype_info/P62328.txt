UniprotID	P62328
Accession	P62328;P01253;P01254;Q546P5;Q63576;Q9UE55
EntryName	TYB4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thymosin beta-4 (T beta-4) (Fx) [Cleaved into: Hemoregulatory peptide AcSDKP (Ac-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro) (N-acetyl-SDKP) (AcSDKP) (Seraspenide)]
GeneName	TMSB4X TB4X THYB4 TMSB4
Length	44
Function	Plays an important role in the organization of the cytoskeleton (PubMed:10848969, PubMed:1999398). Binds to and sequesters actin monomers (G actin) and therefore inhibits actin polymerization (PubMed:10848969, PubMed:1999398).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
