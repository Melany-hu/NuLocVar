UniprotID	Q6L8G8
Accession	Q6L8G8;B2RNM3;Q701N5
EntryName	KRA57_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 5-7 (Keratin-associated protein 5-3) (Keratin-associated protein 5.3) (Keratin-associated protein 5.7) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 5.7)
GeneName	KRTAP5-7 KAP5-7 KAP5.3 KRTAP5.3 KRTAP5.7
Length	165
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated protein (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
