UniprotID	Q8N5H3-1
Accession	Q8N5H3;E9PB01;E9PL72;Q6PJ27
EntryName	LRA25_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine repeat adapter protein 25
GeneName	FAM89B Lrap25
Length	176
Function	Negatively regulates TGF-beta-induced signaling; in cooperation with SKI prevents the translocation of SMAD2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TGF-beta. Acts as an adapter that mediates the specific recognition of LIMK1 by CDC42BPA and CDC42BPB in the lamellipodia. LRAP25-mediated CDC42BPA/CDC42BPB targeting to LIMK1 and the lamellipodium results in LIMK1 activation and the subsequent phosphorylation of CFL1 which is important for lamellipodial F-actin regulation.
