UniprotID	Q6UXT8
Accession	Q6UXT8;B7ZMG9
EntryName	ALKL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ALK and LTK ligand 1 (Augmentor beta) (AUG-beta)
GeneName	ALKAL1 FAM150A UNQ9433/PRO34745
Length	129
Function	Cytokine that acts as a physiological ligand for receptor tyrosine kinase LTK, leading to its activation (PubMed:25331893, PubMed:26418745, PubMed:26630010, PubMed:34646012, PubMed:34819673). Monomeric ALKAL1 binds to LTK, leading to LTK homodimerization and activation (PubMed:34646012, PubMed:34819673). In contrast to ALKAL2, does not act as a potent physiological ligand for ALK (PubMed:26418745, PubMed:34646012).
