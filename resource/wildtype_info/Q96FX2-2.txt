UniprotID	Q96FX2-2
Accession	Q96FX2
EntryName	DPH3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Diphthamide biosynthesis protein 3 (CSL-type zinc finger-containing protein 2) (DelGEF-interacting protein 1) (DelGIP1)
GeneName	DPH3 DESR1 ZCSL2
Length	57
Function	Required for the first step of diphthamide biosynthesis, a post-translational modification of histidine which occurs in elongation factor 2. DPH1 and DPH2 transfer a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to a histidine residue, the reaction is assisted by a reduction system comprising DPH3 and a NADH-dependent reductase. Acts as an electron donor to reduce the Fe-S cluster in DPH1-DPH2 keeping the  clusters in the active and reduced state. Restores iron to DPH1-DPH2 iron-sulfur clusters which have degraded from  to  by donating an iron atom to reform  clusters, in a manner dependent on the presence of elongation factor 2 and SAM. Associates with the elongator complex and is required for tRNA Wobble base modifications mediated by the elongator complex. The elongator complex is required for multiple tRNA modifications, including mcm5U (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl uridine), mcm5s 2U (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine), and ncm5U (5-carbamoylmethyl uridine).
