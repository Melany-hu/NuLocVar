EntryName	FGF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) (Basic fibroblast growth factor) (bFGF) (Heparin-binding growth factor 2) (HBGF-2)
GeneName	FGF2 FGFB
Length	155
Function	Acts as a ligand for FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4 (PubMed:8663044). Also acts as an integrin ligand which is required for FGF2 signaling (PubMed:28302677). Binds to integrin ITGAV:ITGB3 (PubMed:28302677). Plays an important role in the regulation of cell survival, cell division, cell differentiation and cell migration (PubMed:28302677, PubMed:8663044). Functions as a potent mitogen in vitro (PubMed:1721615, PubMed:3732516, PubMed:3964259). Can induce angiogenesis (PubMed:23469107, PubMed:28302677). Mediates phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and thereby promotes retinal lens fiber differentiation (PubMed:29501879).
