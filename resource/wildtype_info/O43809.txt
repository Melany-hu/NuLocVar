UniprotID	O43809
Accession	O43809;Q6IB85;Q6NE84
EntryName	CPSF5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 5 (Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 25 kDa subunit) (CPSF 25 kDa subunit) (Cleavage factor Im complex 25 kDa subunit) (CFIm25) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 21) (Nudix motif 21) (Nudix hydrolase 21) (Pre-mRNA cleavage factor Im 68 kDa subunit)
GeneName	NUDT21 CFIM25 CPSF25 CPSF5
Length	227
Function	Component of the cleavage factor Im (CFIm) complex that functions as an activator of the pre-mRNA 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation processing required for the maturation of pre-mRNA into functional mRNAs (PubMed:14690600, PubMed:15937220, PubMed:17024186, PubMed:17098938, PubMed:29276085, PubMed:8626397, PubMed:9659921). CFIm contributes to the recruitment of multiprotein complexes on specific sequences on the pre-mRNA 3'-end, so called cleavage and polyadenylation signals (pA signals) (PubMed:14690600, PubMed:17024186, PubMed:8626397, PubMed:9659921). Most pre-mRNAs contain multiple pA signals, resulting in alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) producing mRNAs with variable 3'-end formation (PubMed:17098938, PubMed:23187700, PubMed:29276085). The CFIm complex acts as a key regulator of cleavage and polyadenylation site choice during APA through its binding to 5'-UGUA-3' elements localized in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) for a huge number of pre-mRNAs (PubMed:17098938, PubMed:20695905, PubMed:29276085). NUDT21/CPSF5 activates indirectly the mRNA 3'-processing machinery by recruiting CPSF6 and/or CPSF7 (PubMed:29276085). Binds to 5'-UGUA-3' elements localized upstream of pA signals that act as enhancers of pre-mRNA 3'-end processing (PubMed:14690600, PubMed:15169763, PubMed:17024186, PubMed:20479262, PubMed:22813749, PubMed:8626397). The homodimer mediates simultaneous sequence-specific recognition of two 5'-UGUA-3' elements within the pre-mRNA (PubMed:20479262, PubMed:21295486). Plays a role in somatic cell fate transitions and pluripotency by regulating widespread changes in gene expression through an APA-dependent function (By similarity). Binds to chromatin (By similarity). Binds to, but does not hydrolyze mono- and di-adenosine nucleotides (PubMed:18445629).
