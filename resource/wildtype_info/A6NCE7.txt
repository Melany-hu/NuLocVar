UniprotID	A6NCE7
Accession	A6NCE7
EntryName	MP3B2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta 2 (Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 beta 2) (Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B-like) (MAP1A/MAP1B LC3 B-like) (MAP1A/MAP1B light chain 3 B-like)
GeneName	MAP1LC3B2
Length	125
Function	Ubiquitin-like modifier involved in formation of autophagosomal vacuoles (autophagosomes). Plays a role in mitophagy which contributes to regulate mitochondrial quantity and quality by eliminating the mitochondria to a basal level to fulfill cellular energy requirements and preventing excess ROS production. In response to cellular stress and upon mitochondria fission, binds C-18 ceramides and anchors autophagolysosomes to outer mitochondrial membranes to eliminate damaged mitochondria. While LC3s are involved in elongation of the phagophore membrane, the GABARAP/GATE-16 subfamily is essential for a later stage in autophagosome maturation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome membrane; Endomembrane system; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
