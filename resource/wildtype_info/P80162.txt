UniprotID	P80162
Accession	P80162;B2R4X3;Q4W5D4
EntryName	CXCL6_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-X-C motif chemokine 6 (Chemokine alpha 3) (CKA-3) (Granulocyte chemotactic protein 2) (GCP-2) (Small-inducible cytokine B6) [Cleaved into: Small-inducible cytokine B6, N-processed variant 1; Small-inducible cytokine B6, N-processed variant 2; Small-inducible cytokine B6, N-processed variant 3]
GeneName	CXCL6 GCP2 SCYB6
Length	114
Function	Chemotactic for neutrophil granulocytes. Signals through binding and activation of its receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2). In addition to its chemotactic and angiogenic properties, it has strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (90-fold-higher when compared to CXCL5 and CXCL7).
