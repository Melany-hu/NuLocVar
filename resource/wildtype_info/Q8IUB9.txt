UniprotID	Q8IUB9
Accession	Q8IUB9;A4QN27;Q3LI75
EntryName	KR191_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 19-1 (High tyrosine-glycine keratin-associated protein 19.1)
GeneName	KRTAP19-1 KAP19.1 KRTAP19.1
Length	90
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
