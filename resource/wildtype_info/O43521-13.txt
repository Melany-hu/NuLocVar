UniprotID	O43521-13
Accession	O43521;A8K2W2;O43522;Q0MSE7;Q0MSE8;Q0MSE9;Q53R28;Q6JTU6;Q6T851;Q6TE14;Q6TE15;Q6TE16;Q6V402;Q8WYL6;Q8WYL7;Q8WYL8;Q8WYL9;Q8WYM0;Q8WYM1
EntryName	B2L11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bcl-2-like protein 11 (Bcl2-L-11) (Bcl2-interacting mediator of cell death)
GeneName	BCL2L11 BIM
Length	44
Function	Induces apoptosis and anoikis. Isoform BimL is more potent than isoform BimEL. Isoform Bim-alpha1, isoform Bim-alpha2 and isoform Bim-alpha3 induce apoptosis, although less potent than isoform BimEL, isoform BimL and isoform BimS. Isoform Bim-gamma induces apoptosis. Isoform Bim-alpha3 induces apoptosis possibly through a caspase-mediated pathway. Isoform BimAC and isoform BimABC lack the ability to induce apoptosis.
