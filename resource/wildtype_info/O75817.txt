UniprotID	O75817
Accession	O75817;A4D2E0;Q9BV74
EntryName	POP7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease P protein subunit p20 (RNaseP protein p20) (Ribonucleases P/MRP protein subunit POP7 homolog) (hPOP7)
GeneName	POP7 RPP20
Length	140
Function	Component of ribonuclease P, a ribonucleoprotein complex that generates mature tRNA molecules by cleaving their 5'-ends (PubMed:30454648, PubMed:9630247). Also a component of the MRP ribonuclease complex, which cleaves pre-rRNA sequences (PubMed:28115465).
