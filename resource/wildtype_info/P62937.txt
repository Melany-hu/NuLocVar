EntryName	PPIA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPIase A) (EC 5.2.1.8) (Cyclophilin A) (Cyclosporin A-binding protein) (Rotamase A) [Cleaved into: Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	PPIA CYPA
Length	165
Function	Catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides (PubMed:2001362, PubMed:20676357, PubMed:21245143, PubMed:21593166, PubMed:25678563). Exerts a strong chemotactic effect on leukocytes partly through activation of one of its membrane receptors BSG/CD147, initiating a signaling cascade that culminates in MAPK/ERK activation (PubMed:11943775, PubMed:21245143). Activates endothelial cells (ECs) in a pro-inflammatory manner by stimulating activation of NF-kappa-B and ERK, JNK and p38 MAP-kinases and by inducing expression of adhesion molecules including SELE and VCAM1 (PubMed:15130913). Induces apoptosis in ECs by promoting the FOXO1-dependent expression of CCL2 and BCL2L11 which are involved in EC chemotaxis and apoptosis (PubMed:31063815). In response to oxidative stress, initiates proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signaling in ECs via activation of NF-kappa-B and AKT1 and up-regulation of antiapoptotic protein BCL2 (PubMed:23180369). Negatively regulates MAP3K5/ASK1 kinase activity, autophosphorylation and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis mediated by MAP3K5/ASK1 (PubMed:26095851). Necessary for the assembly of TARDBP in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes and regulates TARDBP binding to RNA UG repeats and TARDBP-dependent expression of HDAC6, ATG7 and VCP which are involved in clearance of protein aggregates (PubMed:25678563). Plays an important role in platelet activation and aggregation (By similarity). Regulates calcium mobilization and integrin ITGA2B:ITGB3 bidirectional signaling via increased ROS production as well as by facilitating the interaction between integrin and the cell cytoskeleton (By similarity). Binds heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (PubMed:11943775). Inhibits replication of influenza A virus (IAV) (PubMed:19207730). Inhibits ITCH/AIP4-mediated ubiquitination of matrix protein 1 (M1) of IAV by impairing the interaction of ITCH/AIP4 with M1, followed by the suppression of the nuclear export of M1, and finally reduction of the replication of IAV (PubMed:22347431, PubMed:30328013).
