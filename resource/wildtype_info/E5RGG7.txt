UniprotID	E5RGG7
Accession	E5RGG7
EntryName	E5RGG7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein-L-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase domain-containing protein 1
GeneName	PCMTD1
Length	105
Function	Substrate recognition component of an ECS (Elongin BC-CUL5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Specifically binds to the methyltransferase cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) via the N-terminal AdoMet binding motif, but does not display methyltransferase activity. May provide an alternate maintenance pathway for modified proteins by acting as a damage-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein.
