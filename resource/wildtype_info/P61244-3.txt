UniprotID	P61244-3
Accession	P61244;A6NH73;A8K265;A8K4G4;A8K824;P25912;P52163;Q14803;Q96CY8
EntryName	MAX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein max (Class D basic helix-loop-helix protein 4) (bHLHd4) (Myc-associated factor X)
GeneName	MAX BHLHD4
Length	103
Function	Transcription regulator. Forms a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein complex with MYC or MAD which recognizes the core sequence 5'-CACTG-3'. The MYC:MAX complex is a transcriptional activator, whereas the MAD:MAX complex is a repressor. May repress transcription via the recruitment of a chromatin remodeling complex containing H3 'Lys-9' histone methyltransferase activity. Represses MYC transcriptional activity from E-box elements.
