UniprotID	G3V502
Accession	G3V502
EntryName	G3V502_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit
GeneName	TIMM9
Length	66
Function	Mitochondrial intermembrane chaperone that participates in the import and insertion of some multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Also required for the transfer of beta-barrel precursors from the TOM complex to the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) of the outer membrane. Acts as a chaperone-like protein that protects the hydrophobic precursors from aggregation and guide them through the mitochondrial intermembrane space.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
