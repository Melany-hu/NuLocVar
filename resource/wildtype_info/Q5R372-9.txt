EntryName	RBG1L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rab GTPase-activating protein 1-like
GeneName	RABGAP1L HHL KIAA0471
Length	72
Function	GTP-hydrolysis activating protein (GAP) for small GTPase RAB22A, converting active RAB22A-GTP to the inactive form RAB22A-GDP (PubMed:16923123). Plays a role in endocytosis and intracellular protein transport. Recruited by ANK2 to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)-positive early endosomes, where it inactivates RAB22A, and promotes polarized trafficking to the leading edge of the migrating cells. Part of the ANK2/RABGAP1L complex which is required for the polarized recycling of fibronectin receptor ITGA5 ITGB1 to the plasma membrane that enables continuous directional cell migration (By similarity).
