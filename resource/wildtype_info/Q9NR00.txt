UniprotID	Q9NR00
Accession	Q9NR00
EntryName	TCIM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcriptional and immune response regulator (Thyroid cancer protein 1) (TC-1)
GeneName	TCIM C8orf4 TC1
Length	106
Function	Seems to be involved in the regulation of cell growth an differentiation, may play different and opposite roles depending on the tissue or cell type. May enhance the WNT-CTNNB1 pathway by relieving antagonistic activity of CBY1 (PubMed:16424001, PubMed:16730711). Enhances the proliferation of follicular dendritic cells (PubMed:16730711). Plays a role in the mitogen-activated MAPK2/3 signaling pathway, positively regulates G1-to-S-phase transition of the cell cycle (PubMed:18959821). In endothelial cells, enhances key inflammatory mediators and inflammatory response through the modulation of NF-kappaB transcriptional regulatory activity (PubMed:19684084). Involved in the regulation of heat shock response, seems to play a positive feedback with HSF1 to modulate heat-shock downstream gene expression (PubMed:17603013). Plays a role in the regulation of hematopoiesis even if the mechanisms are unknown (By similarity). In cancers such as thyroid or lung cancer, it has been described as promoter of cell proliferation, G1-to-S-phase transition and inhibitor of apoptosis (PubMed:15087392, PubMed:24941347). However, it negatively regulates self-renewal of liver cancer cells via suppresion of NOTCH2 signaling (PubMed:25985737).
