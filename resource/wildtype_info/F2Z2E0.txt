UniprotID	F2Z2E0
Accession	F2Z2E0
EntryName	F2Z2E0_HUMAN
ProteinName	D-aspartate oxidase (EC 1.4.3.1)
GeneName	DDO
Length	110
Function	Selectively catalyzes the oxidative deamination of acidic amino acids. Suppresses the level of D-aspartate in the brain, an amino acid that can act as an agonist for glutamate receptors. Protects the organism from the toxicity of D-amino acids. May also function in the intestine.
