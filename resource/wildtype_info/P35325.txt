UniprotID	P35325
Accession	P35325;Q5T528
EntryName	SPR2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small proline-rich protein 2B (SPR-2B)
GeneName	SPRR2B
Length	72
Function	Cross-linked envelope protein of keratinocytes. It is a keratinocyte protein that first appears in the cell cytosol, but ultimately becomes cross-linked to membrane proteins by transglutaminase. All that results in the formation of an insoluble envelope beneath the plasma membrane.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
