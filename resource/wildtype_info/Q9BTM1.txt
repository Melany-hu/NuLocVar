UniprotID	Q9BTM1
Accession	Q9BTM1;Q9NV63
EntryName	H2AJ_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A.J (H2a/j)
GeneName	H2AJ H2AFJ
Length	129
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
