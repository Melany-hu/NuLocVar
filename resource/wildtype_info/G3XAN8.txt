UniprotID	G3XAN8
Accession	G3XAN8
EntryName	G3XAN8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit
GeneName	TIMM8B hCG_39462
Length	98
Function	Mitochondrial intermembrane chaperone that participates in the import and insertion of some multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Also required for the transfer of beta-barrel precursors from the TOM complex to the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) of the outer membrane. Acts as a chaperone-like protein that protects the hydrophobic precursors from aggregation and guide them through the mitochondrial intermembrane space.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
