UniprotID	O43687-2
Accession	O43687;A8K2K6;Q5TBR9;Q5TBS0;Q9HCZ8;Q9P0G4
EntryName	AKA7A_HUMAN
ProteinName	A-kinase anchor protein 7 isoforms alpha and beta (AKAP-7 isoforms alpha and beta) (A-kinase anchor protein 18 kDa) (AKAP 18) (Protein kinase A-anchoring protein 7 isoforms alpha/beta) (PRKA7 isoforms alpha/beta)
GeneName	AKAP7 AKAP15 AKAP18
Length	81
Function	Targets the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to the plasma membrane, and permits functional coupling to the L-type calcium channel. The membrane-associated form reduces epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity, whereas the free cytoplasmic form may negatively regulate ENaC channel feedback inhibition by intracellular sodium.
