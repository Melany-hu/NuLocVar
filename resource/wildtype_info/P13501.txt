UniprotID	P13501
Accession	P13501;O43646;Q0QVW8;Q4ZGJ1;Q9NYA2;Q9UBG2;Q9UC99
EntryName	CCL5_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 5 (EoCP) (Eosinophil chemotactic cytokine) (SIS-delta) (Small-inducible cytokine A5) (T cell-specific protein P228) (TCP228) (T-cell-specific protein RANTES) [Cleaved into: RANTES(3-68); RANTES(4-68)]
GeneName	CCL5 D17S136E SCYA5
Length	91
Function	Chemoattractant for blood monocytes, memory T-helper cells and eosinophils. Causes the release of histamine from basophils and activates eosinophils. May activate several chemokine receptors including CCR1, CCR3, CCR4 and CCR5. One of the major HIV-suppressive factors produced by CD8+ T-cells. Recombinant RANTES protein induces a dose-dependent inhibition of different strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). The processed form RANTES(3-68) acts as a natural chemotaxis inhibitor and is a more potent inhibitor of HIV-1-infection. The second processed form RANTES(4-68) exhibits reduced chemotactic and HIV-suppressive activity compared with RANTES(1-68) and RANTES(3-68) (PubMed:1380064, PubMed:15923218, PubMed:16791620, PubMed:8525373, PubMed:9516414). May also be an agonist of the G protein-coupled receptor GPR75, stimulating inositol trisphosphate production and calcium mobilization through its activation. Together with GPR75, may play a role in neuron survival through activation of a downstream signaling pathway involving the PI3, Akt and MAP kinases. By activating GPR75 may also play a role in insulin secretion by islet cells (PubMed:23979485).
