UniprotID	P62072
Accession	P62072;A8K136;Q9WV99;Q9WVA0;Q9Y5J8
EntryName	TIM10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim10
GeneName	TIMM10 TIM10
Length	90
Function	Mitochondrial intermembrane chaperone that participates in the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. May also be required for the transfer of beta-barrel precursors from the TOM complex to the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) of the outer membrane. Acts as a chaperone-like protein that protects the hydrophobic precursors from aggregation and guide them through the mitochondrial intermembrane space.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
