EntryName	DYST_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dystonin (230 kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen) (230/240 kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen) (Bullous pemphigoid antigen 1) (BPA) (Bullous pemphigoid antigen) (Dystonia musculorum protein) (Hemidesmosomal plaque protein)
GeneName	DST BP230 BP240 BPAG1 DMH DT KIAA0728
Length	81
Function	Cytoskeletal linker protein. Acts as an integrator of intermediate filaments, actin and microtubule cytoskeleton networks. Required for anchoring either intermediate filaments to the actin cytoskeleton in neural and muscle cells or keratin-containing intermediate filaments to hemidesmosomes in epithelial cells. The proteins may self-aggregate to form filaments or a two-dimensional mesh. Regulates the organization and stability of the microtubule network of sensory neurons to allow axonal transport. Mediates docking of the dynein/dynactin motor complex to vesicle cargos for retrograde axonal transport through its interaction with TMEM108 and DCTN1 (By similarity).
