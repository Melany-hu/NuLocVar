UniprotID	Q9HAF1
Accession	Q9HAF1;B1AK64;Q4F967;Q7Z311;Q86WE3
EntryName	EAF6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chromatin modification-related protein MEAF6 (MYST/Esa1-associated factor 6) (Esa1-associated factor 6 homolog) (Protein EAF6 homolog) (hEAF6) (Sarcoma antigen NY-SAR-91)
GeneName	MEAF6 C1orf149 CENP-28 EAF6
Length	191
Function	Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex which is involved in transcriptional activation of select genes principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 and H2A (PubMed:14966270). This modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription (PubMed:14966270). Component of HBO1 complexes, which specifically mediate acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-14' (H3K14ac), and have reduced activity toward histone H4 (PubMed:16387653, PubMed:24065767). Component of the MOZ/MORF complex which has a histone H3 acetyltransferase activity (PubMed:18794358).
