UniprotID	A6NF83
Accession	A6NF83
EntryName	NUPR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear protein 2 (Nuclear transcriptional regulator 1-like protein) (Nuclear transcriptional regulator protein 2)
GeneName	NUPR2 NUPR1L
Length	97
Function	Acts as a transcriptional repressor by inhibiting gene expression at the NUPR1 promoter in a p53/TP53-dependent manner in cancer cells (PubMed:25899918). Involved in the G1 cell cycle arrest, and in a decrease in cell viability and cell proliferation (PubMed:25899918). Plays a role as a negative regulator of the protumoral factor NUPR1 (PubMed:25899918).
