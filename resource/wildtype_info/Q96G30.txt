UniprotID	Q96G30
Accession	Q96G30;A8K9M1;Q8IXM9;Q8N2D1
EntryName	MRAP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein 2 (MC2R accessory protein 2)
GeneName	MRAP2 C6orf117
Length	205
Function	Modulator of melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R), a receptor involved in energy homeostasis. Plays a central role in the control of energy homeostasis and body weight regulation by increasing ligand-sensitivity of MC4R and MC4R-mediated generation of cAMP (By similarity). May also act as a negative regulator of MC2R: competes with MRAP for binding to MC2R and impairs the binding of corticotropin (ACTH) to MC2R. May also regulate activity of other melanocortin receptors (MC1R, MC3R and MC5R); however, additional evidence is required in vivo.
