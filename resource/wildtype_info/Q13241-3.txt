EntryName	KLRD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Natural killer cells antigen CD94 (KP43) (Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily D member 1) (NK cell receptor) (CD antigen CD94)
GeneName	KLRD1 CD94
Length	148
Function	Immune receptor involved in self-nonself discrimination. In complex with KLRC1 or KLRC2 on cytotoxic and regulatory lymphocyte subsets, recognizes non-classical major histocompatibility (MHC) class Ib molecule HLA-E loaded with self-peptides derived from the signal sequence of classical MHC class Ia and non-classical MHC class Ib molecules (PubMed:10023772, PubMed:18064301, PubMed:18083576, PubMed:37264229, PubMed:9486650, PubMed:9754572). Enables cytotoxic cells to monitor the expression of MHC class I molecules in healthy cells and to tolerate self (PubMed:12387742, PubMed:18064301, PubMed:9430220). Primarily functions as a ligand binding subunit as it lacks the capacity to signal.
