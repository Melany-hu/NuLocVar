UniprotID	Q9NPA8
Accession	Q9NPA8;B2RE52;G3V117
EntryName	ENY2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription and mRNA export factor ENY2 (Enhancer of yellow 2 transcription factor homolog)
GeneName	ENY2 DC6
Length	101
Function	Involved in mRNA export coupled transcription activation by association with both the TREX-2 and the SAGA complexes. The transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA is a multiprotein complex that activates transcription by remodeling chromatin and mediating histone acetylation and deubiquitination. Within the SAGA complex, participates in a subcomplex that specifically deubiquitinates both histones H2A and H2B. The SAGA complex is recruited to specific gene promoters by activators such as MYC, where it is required for transcription. Required for nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation (PubMed:18206972, PubMed:21746879). As a component of the TREX-2 complex, involved in the export of mRNAs to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pores (PubMed:23591820).
