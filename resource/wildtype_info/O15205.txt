EntryName	UBD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin D (Diubiquitin) (Ubiquitin-like protein FAT10)
GeneName	UBD FAT10
Length	165
Function	Ubiquitin-like protein modifier which can be covalently attached to target proteins and subsequently leads to their degradation by the 26S proteasome, in a NUB1-dependent manner (PubMed:15831455, PubMed:16707496, PubMed:19166848). Conjugation to the target protein is activated by UBA6 via adenylation of its C-terminal glycine (PubMed:17889673, PubMed:35970836). Promotes the expression of the proteasome subunit beta type-9 (PSMB9/LMP2). Regulates TNF-alpha-induced and LPS-mediated activation of the central mediator of innate immunity NF-kappa-B by promoting TNF-alpha-mediated proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated-I-kappa-B-alpha (PubMed:19959714). Required for TNF-alpha-induced p65 nuclear translocation in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs). May be involved in dendritic cell (DC) maturation, the process by which immature dendritic cells differentiate into fully competent antigen-presenting cells that initiate T-cell responses (PubMed:19028597). Mediates mitotic non-disjunction and chromosome instability, in long-term in vitro culture and cancers, by abbreviating mitotic phase and impairing the kinetochore localization of MAD2L1 during the prometaphase stage of the cell cycle (PubMed:16495226). May be involved in the formation of aggresomes when proteasome is saturated or impaired (PubMed:19033385). Mediates apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner, especially in renal epithelium and tubular cells during renal diseases such as polycystic kidney disease and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) (PubMed:16495380).
