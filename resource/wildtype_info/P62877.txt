ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RBX1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (EC 2.3.2.32) (E3 ubiquitin-protein transferase RBX1) (Protein ZYP) (RING finger protein 75) (RING-box protein 1) (Rbx1) (Regulator of cullins 1) (ROC1) [Cleaved into: E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RBX1, N-terminally processed (E3 ubiquitin-protein transferase RBX1, N-terminally processed)]
GeneName	RBX1 RNF75 ROC1
Length	108
Function	E3 ubiquitin ligase component of multiple cullin-RING-based E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (CRLs) complexes which mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, including proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction, transcription and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (PubMed:10230407, PubMed:10579999, PubMed:11961546, PubMed:15983046, PubMed:16678110, PubMed:19112177, PubMed:19679664, PubMed:22748924, PubMed:23455478, PubMed:27565346, PubMed:29769719, PubMed:32355176, PubMed:33417871, PubMed:38326650, PubMed:38316879). CRLs complexes and ARIH1 collaborate in tandem to mediate ubiquitination of target proteins, ARIH1 mediating addition of the first ubiquitin on CRLs targets (PubMed:27565346). The functional specificity of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes depends on the variable substrate recognition components. As a component of the CSA complex mediates ubiquitination of Pol II subunit RPB1 at 'Lys-1268', a critical TC-NER checkpoint (PubMed:32355176, PubMed:34526721). Core component of the Cul7-RING(FBXW8) ubiquitin ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:35982156). Core component of a Cul9-RING ubiquitin ligase complex composed of CUL9 and RBX1, which mediates mono-ubiquitination of p53/TP53 (PubMed:38605244). Recruits the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme CDC34 to the complex and brings it into close proximity to the substrate. Probably also stimulates CDC34 autoubiquitination. May be required for histone H3 and histone H4 ubiquitination in response to ultraviolet and for subsequent DNA repair. Promotes the neddylation of CUL1, CUL2, CUL4 and CUL4 via its interaction with UBE2M. Involved in the ubiquitination of KEAP1, ENC1 and KLHL41. In concert with ATF2 and CUL3, promotes degradation of KAT5 thereby attenuating its ability to acetylate and activate ATM. As part of a multisubunit complex composed of elongin BC complex (ELOB and ELOC), elongin A/ELOA, RBX1 and CUL5; polyubiquitinates monoubiquitinated POLR2A (PubMed:19920177).
