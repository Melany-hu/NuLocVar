UniprotID	A1A580
Accession	A1A580
EntryName	KR231_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 23-1
GeneName	KRTAP23-1 KAP23.1
Length	65
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
