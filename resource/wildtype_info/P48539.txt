UniprotID	P48539
Accession	P48539;A6NDJ9;Q6ICS4;Q93059
EntryName	PCP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calmodulin regulator protein PCP4 (Brain-specific polypeptide PEP-19) (Purkinje cell protein 4)
GeneName	PCP4 PEP19
Length	62
Function	Functions as a modulator of calcium-binding by calmodulin. Thereby, regulates calmodulin activity and the different processes it controls (PubMed:19106096, PubMed:23204517, PubMed:27876793). For instance, may play a role in neuronal differentiation through activation of calmodulin-dependent kinase signaling pathways (PubMed:21491429).
