UniprotID	Q6JSD7
Accession	Q6JSD7
EntryName	Q6JSD7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aquaporin-1 (Aquaporin-CHIP)
GeneName	AQP1
Length	81
Function	Forms a water channel that facilitates the transport of water across cell membranes, playing a crucial role in water homeostasis in various tissues. Could also be permeable to small solutes including hydrogen peroxide, glycerol and gases such as amonnia (NH3), nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Recruited to the ankyrin-1 complex, a multiprotein complex of the erythrocyte membrane, it could be part of a CO2 metabolon, linking facilitated diffusion of CO2 across the membrane, anion exchange of Cl(-)/HCO3(-) and interconversion of dissolved CO2 and carbonic acid in the cytosol. In vitro, it shows non-selective gated cation channel activity and may be permeable to cations like K(+) and Na(+) in vivo.
