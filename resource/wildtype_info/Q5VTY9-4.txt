EntryName	HHAT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein-cysteine N-palmitoyltransferase HHAT (EC 2.3.1.-) (Hedgehog acyltransferase) (Melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells 2) (MART-2) (Skinny hedgehog protein 1)
GeneName	HHAT MART2 SKI1
Length	82
Function	Palmitoyl acyltransferase that catalyzes N-terminal palmitoylation of SHH; which is required for SHH signaling (PubMed:18534984, PubMed:24784881, PubMed:31875564). It also catalyzes N-terminal palmitoylation of DHH (PubMed:24784881). Promotes the transfer of palmitoyl-CoA from the cytoplasmic to the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where SHH palmitoylation occurs (PubMed:31875564). It is an essential factor for proper embryonic development and testicular organogenesis (PubMed:24784881).
