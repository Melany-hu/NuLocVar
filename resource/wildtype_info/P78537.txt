UniprotID	P78537
Accession	P78537;A1L4Q9;Q6NZ45
EntryName	BL1S1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 subunit 1 (BLOC-1 subunit 1) (GCN5-like protein 1) (Protein RT14) (Protein acetyltransferase BLOC1S1) (EC 2.3.1.-)
GeneName	BLOC1S1 BLOS1 GCN5L1 RT14
Length	153
Function	Component of the BLOC-1 complex, a complex that is required for normal biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LRO), such as platelet dense granules and melanosomes (PubMed:17182842). In concert with the AP-3 complex, the BLOC-1 complex is required to target membrane protein cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals (PubMed:17182842). The BLOC-1 complex, in association with SNARE proteins, is also proposed to be involved in neurite extension (PubMed:17182842). As part of the BORC complex may play a role in lysosomes movement and localization at the cell periphery (PubMed:25898167). Associated with the cytosolic face of lysosomes, the BORC complex may recruit ARL8B and couple lysosomes to microtubule plus-end-directed kinesin motor (PubMed:25898167).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion intermembrane space; Mitochondrion matrix; Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Lysosome membrane
