EntryName	KANL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	KAT8 regulatory NSL complex subunit 3 (NSL complex protein NSL3) (Non-specific lethal 3 homolog) (Serum inhibited-related protein) (Testis development protein PRTD)
GeneName	KANSL3 KIAA1310 NSL3 PRTD SI1
Length	141
Function	Non-catalytic component of the NSL histone acetyltransferase complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates histone H4 acetylation at 'Lys-5'- and 'Lys-8' (H4K5ac and H4K8ac) at transcription start sites and promotes transcription initiation (PubMed:20018852, PubMed:33657400). The NSL complex also acts as a regulator of gene expression in mitochondria (PubMed:27768893). Within the NSL complex, KANSL3 is required to promote KAT8 association with mitochondrial DNA (PubMed:27768893).
