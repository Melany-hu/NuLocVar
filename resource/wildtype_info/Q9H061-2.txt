UniprotID	Q9H061-2
Accession	Q9H061;B2R570;E9PI16
EntryName	T126A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 126A
GeneName	TMEM126A
Length	125
Function	Protein required for the cotranslational protein quality control in the inner membrane of the mitochondria (PubMed:38199007). Associates with newly synthesized polypeptides and may act as a chaperone that cooperates with OXA1L for the insertion of newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins into the inner membrane (PubMed:38199007). Required for the assembly of the ND4 module of mitochondrial complex I (PubMed:33879611, PubMed:33882309).
