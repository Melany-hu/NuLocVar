EntryName	CP3A5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 3A5 (EC 1.14.14.1) (CYPIIIA5) (Cytochrome P450-PCN3)
GeneName	CYP3A5
Length	140
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of steroid hormones and vitamins (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11093772, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:2732228). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11093772, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:2732228). Exhibits high catalytic activity for the formation of catechol estrogens from 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2 (PubMed:12865317). Catalyzes 6beta-hydroxylation of the steroid hormones testosterone, progesterone, and androstenedione (PubMed:2732228). Catalyzes the oxidative conversion of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal, a rate-limiting step for the biosynthesis of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) (PubMed:10681376). Further metabolizes all trans-retinoic acid (atRA) to 4-hydroxyretinoate and may play a role in hepatic atRA clearance (PubMed:11093772). Also involved in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics, including calcium channel blocking drug nifedipine and immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine (PubMed:2732228).
