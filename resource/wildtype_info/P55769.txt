UniprotID	P55769
Accession	P55769
EntryName	NH2L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	NHP2-like protein 1 (High mobility group-like nuclear protein 2 homolog 1) (OTK27) (SNU13 homolog) (hSNU13) (U4/U6.U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein SNU13) (U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP 15.5 kDa protein) [Cleaved into: NHP2-like protein 1, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	SNU13 NHP2L1
Length	128
Function	Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797). Involved in pre-mRNA splicing as component of the spliceosome (PubMed:28781166). Binds to the 5'-stem-loop of U4 snRNA and thereby contributes to spliceosome assembly (PubMed:10545122, PubMed:17412961). The protein undergoes a conformational change upon RNA-binding (PubMed:10545122, PubMed:17412961, PubMed:28781166). Core component of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complexes that function in methylation of multiple sites on ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (PubMed:39570315).
