UniprotID	Q99880
Accession	Q99880;B2R5A3;Q52LW9
EntryName	H2B1L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type 1-L (Histone H2B.c) (H2B/c)
GeneName	H2BC13 H2BFC HIST1H2BL
Length	126
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
