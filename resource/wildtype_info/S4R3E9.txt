UniprotID	S4R3E9
Accession	S4R3E9
EntryName	S4R3E9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 (Neddylin)
GeneName	NEDD8-MDP1
Length	84
Function	Ubiquitin-like protein which plays an important role in cell cycle control and embryogenesis via its conjugation to a limited number of cellular proteins, such as cullins or p53/TP53. Attachment of NEDD8 to cullins is critical for the recruitment of E2 to the cullin-RING-based E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, thus facilitating polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of cyclins and other regulatory proteins. Attachment of NEDD8 to p53/TP53 inhibits p53/TP53 transcriptional activity. Covalent attachment to its substrates requires prior activation by the E1 complex UBE1C-APPBP1 and linkage to the E2 enzyme UBE2M.
