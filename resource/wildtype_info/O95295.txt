UniprotID	O95295
Accession	O95295;D3DV56;Q5SXU8
EntryName	SNAPN_HUMAN
ProteinName	SNARE-associated protein Snapin (Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 subunit 7) (BLOC-1 subunit 7) (Synaptosomal-associated protein 25-binding protein) (SNAP-associated protein)
GeneName	SNAPIN BLOC1S7 SNAP25BP SNAPAP
Length	136
Function	Component of the BLOC-1 complex, a complex that is required for normal biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LRO), such as platelet dense granules and melanosomes. In concert with the AP-3 complex, the BLOC-1 complex is required to target membrane protein cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals. The BLOC-1 complex, in association with SNARE proteins, is also proposed to be involved in neurite extension. Plays a role in intracellular vesicle trafficking and synaptic vesicle recycling. May modulate a step between vesicle priming, fusion and calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release through its ability to potentiate the interaction of synaptotagmin with the SNAREs and the plasma-membrane-associated protein SNAP25. Its phosphorylation state influences exocytotic protein interactions and may regulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis. May also have a role in the mechanisms of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in non-neuronal cells (PubMed:17182842, PubMed:18167355). As part of the BORC complex may play a role in lysosomes movement and localization at the cell periphery. Associated with the cytosolic face of lysosomes, the BORC complex may recruit ARL8B and couple lysosomes to microtubule plus-end-directed kinesin motor (PubMed:25898167).
