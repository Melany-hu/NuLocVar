UniprotID	P62820-2
Accession	P62820;P11476;Q6FIE7;Q96N61;Q9Y3T2
EntryName	RAB1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-1A (EC 3.6.5.2) (YPT1-related protein)
GeneName	RAB1A RAB1
Length	141
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes (PubMed:20639577, PubMed:20861236, PubMed:21303926, PubMed:22939626). Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (PubMed:20639577, PubMed:20861236, PubMed:21303926, PubMed:22939626). RAB1A regulates vesicular protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi compartment and on to the cell surface, and plays a role in IL-8 and growth hormone secretion (PubMed:21303926). Required to modulate the compacted morphology of the Golgi (PubMed:26209634). Regulates the level of CASR present at the cell membrane (PubMed:20861236). Plays a role in cell adhesion and cell migration, via its role in protein trafficking (PubMed:20639577). Plays a role in autophagosome assembly and cellular defense reactions against pathogenic bacteria (PubMed:22939626). Plays a role in microtubule-dependent protein transport by early endosomes and in anterograde melanosome transport (By similarity).
