EntryName	RAB7A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-7a (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB7A RAB7
Length	207
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion. In its active state, RAB7A binds to a variety of effector proteins playing a key role in the regulation of endo-lysosomal trafficking. Governs early-to-late endosomal maturation, microtubule minus-end as well as plus-end directed endosomal migration and positioning, and endosome-lysosome transport through different protein-protein interaction cascades. Plays a central role, not only in endosomal traffic, but also in many other cellular and physiological events, such as growth-factor-mediated cell signaling, nutrient-transportor mediated nutrient uptake, neurotrophin transport in the axons of neurons and lipid metabolism. Also involved in regulation of some specialized endosomal membrane trafficking, such as maturation of melanosomes, pathogen-induced phagosomes (or vacuoles) and autophagosomes. Plays a role in the maturation and acidification of phagosomes that engulf pathogens, such as S.aureus and M.tuberculosis. Plays a role in the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes. Plays important roles in microbial pathogen infection and survival, as well as in participating in the life cycle of viruses. Microbial pathogens possess survival strategies governed by RAB7A, sometimes by employing RAB7A function (e.g. Salmonella) and sometimes by excluding RAB7A function (e.g. Mycobacterium). In concert with RAC1, plays a role in regulating the formation of RBs (ruffled borders) in osteoclasts. Controls the endosomal trafficking and neurite outgrowth signaling of NTRK1/TRKA (PubMed:11179213, PubMed:12944476, PubMed:14617358, PubMed:20028791, PubMed:21255211). Regulates the endocytic trafficking of the EGF-EGFR complex by regulating its lysosomal degradation. Involved in the ADRB2-stimulated lipolysis through lipophagy, a cytosolic lipase-independent autophagic pathway (By similarity). Required for the exosomal release of SDCBP, CD63 and syndecan (PubMed:22660413). Required for vesicular trafficking and cell surface expression of ACE2 (PubMed:33147445). May play a role in PRPH neuronal intermediate filament assembly (By similarity).
