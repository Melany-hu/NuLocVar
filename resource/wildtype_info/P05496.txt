UniprotID	P05496
Accession	P05496
EntryName	AT5G1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP synthase F(0) complex subunit C1, mitochondrial (ATP synthase lipid-binding protein) (ATP synthase membrane subunit c locus 1) (ATP synthase proteolipid P1) (ATP synthase proton-transporting mitochondrial F(0) complex subunit C1) (ATPase protein 9) (ATPase subunit c) (Proton-conducting channel, ATP synthase F(0) complex subunit c)
GeneName	ATP5MC1 ATP5G1
Length	136
Function	Subunit c, of the mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase complex (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) that produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain (Probable). ATP synthase complex consist of a soluble F(1) head domain - the catalytic core - and a membrane F(1) domain - the membrane proton channel (PubMed:37244256). These two domains are linked by a central stalk rotating inside the F(1) region and a stationary peripheral stalk (PubMed:37244256). During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation (Probable). With the subunit a (MT-ATP6), forms the proton-conducting channel in the F(0) domain, that contains two crucial half-channels (inlet and outlet) that facilitate proton movement from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) into the matrix (PubMed:37244256). Protons are taken up via the inlet half-channel and released through the outlet half-channel, following a Grotthuss mechanism (PubMed:37244256).
