UniprotID	Q16864-2
Accession	Q16864;C9J2K4;Q6IBA8
EntryName	VATF_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit F (V-ATPase subunit F) (V-ATPase 14 kDa subunit) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit F)
GeneName	ATP6V1F ATP6S14 VATF
Length	147
Function	Subunit of the V1 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons (PubMed:33065002). V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane
