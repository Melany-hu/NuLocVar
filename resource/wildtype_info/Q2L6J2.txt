UniprotID	Q2L6J2
Accession	Q2L6J2
EntryName	Q2L6J2_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit
GeneName	ZNRD1 hCG_23775
Length	126
Function	Core component of RNA polymerase I (Pol I), a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which synthesizes ribosomal RNA precursors using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Can mediate Pol I proofreading of the nascent RNA transcript. Anchors into the Pol I active site to monitor transcription fidelity and cleave mis-incorporated 5'-ribonucleotides.
