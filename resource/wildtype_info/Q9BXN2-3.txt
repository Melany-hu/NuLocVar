EntryName	CLC7A_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (Beta-glucan receptor) (C-type lectin superfamily member 12) (Dendritic cell-associated C-type lectin 1) (DC-associated C-type lectin 1) (Dectin-1) (CD antigen CD369)
GeneName	CLEC7A BGR CLECSF12 DECTIN1 UNQ539/PRO1082
Length	189
Function	Lectin that functions as a pattern recognizing receptor (PRR) specific for beta-1,3-linked and beta-1,6-linked glucans, which constitute cell wall constituents from pathogenic bacteria and fungi (PubMed:11567029, PubMed:12423684). Necessary for the TLR2-mediated inflammatory response and activation of NF-kappa-B: upon beta-glucan binding, recruits SYK via its ITAM motif and promotes a signaling cascade that activates some CARD domain-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosomes, leading to the activation of NF-kappa-B and MAP kinase p38 (MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and/or MAPK14) pathways which stimulate expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (By similarity). Enhances cytokine production in macrophages and dendritic cells (By similarity). Mediates production of reactive oxygen species in the cell (By similarity). Mediates phagocytosis of C.albicans conidia (PubMed:17230442). Binds T-cells in a way that does not involve their surface glycans and plays a role in T-cell activation. Stimulates T-cell proliferation. Induces phosphorylation of SCIMP after binding beta-glucans (By similarity).
