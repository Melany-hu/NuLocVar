UniprotID	O95297-5
Accession	O95297;B2REB9;B2REC0;Q5R332;Q8IX11;Q9BWZ3;Q9NYK4;Q9UL20
EntryName	MPZL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myelin protein zero-like protein 1 (Protein zero-related)
GeneName	MPZL1 PZR UNQ849/PRO1787
Length	119
Function	Cell surface receptor, which is involved in signal transduction processes. Recruits PTPN11/SHP-2 to the cell membrane and is a putative substrate of PTPN11/SHP-2. Is a major receptor for concanavalin-A (ConA) and is involved in cellular signaling induced by ConA, which probably includes Src family tyrosine-protein kinases. Isoform 3 seems to have a dominant negative role; it blocks tyrosine phosphorylation of MPZL1 induced by ConA. Isoform 1, but not isoform 2 and isoform 3, may be involved in regulation of integrin-mediated cell motility.
