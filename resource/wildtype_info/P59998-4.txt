UniprotID	P59998-4
Accession	P59998;C9JWM7;E7ETI0;F6TTL5;O15509;Q6P0W5;Q96QJ3
EntryName	ARPC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4 (Arp2/3 complex 20 kDa subunit) (p20-ARC)
GeneName	ARPC4 ARC20
Length	78
Function	Actin-binding component of the Arp2/3 complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates actin polymerization upon stimulation by nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) (PubMed:9230079). The Arp2/3 complex mediates the formation of branched actin networks in the cytoplasm, providing the force for cell motility (PubMed:9230079). In addition to its role in the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, the Arp2/3 complex also promotes actin polymerization in the nucleus, thereby regulating gene transcription and repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:29925947). The Arp2/3 complex promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair in response to DNA damage by promoting nuclear actin polymerization, leading to drive motility of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:29925947).
