Accession	P38936;Q14010;Q6FI05;Q9BUT4
EntryName	CDN1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (CDK-interacting protein 1) (Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 6) (MDA-6) (p21)
GeneName	CDKN1A CAP20 CDKN1 CIP1 MDA6 PIC1 SDI1 WAF1
Length	164
Function	Plays an important role in controlling cell cycle progression and DNA damage-induced G2 arrest (PubMed:9106657). Involved in p53/TP53 mediated inhibition of cellular proliferation in response to DNA damage. Also involved in p53-independent DNA damage-induced G2 arrest mediated by CREB3L1 in astrocytes and osteoblasts (By similarity). Binds to and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase activity, preventing phosphorylation of critical cyclin-dependent kinase substrates and blocking cell cycle progression. Functions in the nuclear localization and assembly of cyclin D-CDK4 complex and promotes its kinase activity towards RB1. At higher stoichiometric ratios, inhibits the kinase activity of the cyclin D-CDK4 complex. Inhibits DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase delta by competing with POLD3 for PCNA binding (PubMed:11595739). Negatively regulates the CDK4- and CDK6-driven phosphorylation of RB1 in keratinocytes, thereby resulting in the release of E2F1 and subsequent transcription of E2F1-driven G1/S phase promoting genes (By similarity).
