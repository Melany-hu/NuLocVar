UniprotID	P61278
Accession	P61278;B2R5G3;P01166
EntryName	SMS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Somatostatin (Growth hormone release-inhibiting factor) [Cleaved into: Somatostatin-28; Somatostatin-14 (SST-14); Neuronostatin (NST)]
GeneName	SST
Length	116
Function	Inhibits the secretion of pituitary hormones, including that of growth hormone/somatotropin (GH1), PRL, ACTH, luteinizing hormone (LH) and TSH. Also impairs ghrelin- and GnRH-stimulated secretion of GH1 and LH; the inhibition of ghrelin-stimulated secretion of GH1 can be further increased by neuronostatin.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
