UniprotID	Q00604
Accession	Q00604;B2R8K6;Q5JYH5
EntryName	NDP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Norrin (Norrie disease protein) (X-linked exudative vitreoretinopathy 2 protein)
GeneName	NDP EVR2
Length	133
Function	Activates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway through FZD4 and LRP5 coreceptor. Plays a central role in retinal vascularization by acting as a ligand for FZD4 that signals via stabilizing beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and activating LEF/TCF-mediated transcriptional programs. Acts in concert with TSPAN12 to activate FZD4 independently of the Wnt-dependent activation of FZD4, suggesting the existence of a Wnt-independent signaling that also promote accumulation the beta-catenin (CTNNB1). May be involved in a pathway that regulates neural cell differentiation and proliferation. Possible role in neuroectodermal cell-cell interaction.
