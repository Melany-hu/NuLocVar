EntryName	NDKM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleoside diphosphate kinase, mitochondrial (NDK) (NDP kinase, mitochondrial) (EC 2.7.4.6) (Nucleoside diphosphate kinase D) (NDPKD) (nm23-H4)
GeneName	NME4 NM23D
Length	117
Function	Major role in the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP. The ATP gamma phosphate is transferred to the NDP beta phosphate via a ping-pong mechanism, using a phosphorylated active-site intermediate. Through the catalyzed exchange of gamma-phosphate between di- and triphosphonucleosides participates in regulation of intracellular nucleotide homeostasis (PubMed:10799505). Binds to anionic phospholipids, predominantly to cardiolipin; the binding inhibits its phosphotransfer activity (PubMed:18635542, PubMed:23150663). Acts as a mitochondria-specific NDK; its association with cardiolipin-containing mitochondrial inner membrane is coupled to respiration suggesting that ADP locally regenerated in the mitochondrion innermembrane space by its activity is directly taken up via ANT ADP/ATP translocase into the matrix space to stimulate respiratory ATP regeneration (PubMed:18635542). Proposed to increase GTP-loading on dynamin-related GTPase OPA1 in mitochondria (PubMed:24970086). In vitro can induce liposome cross-linking suggesting that it can cross-link inner and outer membranes to form contact sites, and promotes intermembrane migration of anionic phosphoplipids. Promotes the redistribution of cardiolipin between the mitochondrial inner membrane and outer membrane which is implicated in pro-apoptotic signaling (PubMed:17028143, PubMed:18635542, PubMed:23150663).
