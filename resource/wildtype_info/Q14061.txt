UniprotID	Q14061
Accession	Q14061;B2R5D2;D3DN84;Q3MHD6
EntryName	COX17_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome c oxidase copper chaperone
GeneName	COX17
Length	63
Function	Copper metallochaperone essential for the assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (CIV), also known as cytochrome c oxidase. Binds two copper ions and delivers them to the metallochaperone SCO1 which transports the copper ions to the Cu(A) site on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (MT-CO2/COX2).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion intermembrane space; Cytoplasm
