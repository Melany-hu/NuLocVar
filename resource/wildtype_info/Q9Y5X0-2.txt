UniprotID	Q9Y5X0-2
Accession	Q9Y5X0;E9PFH5;Q8IYT5
EntryName	SNX10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sorting nexin-10
GeneName	SNX10
Length	117
Function	Probable phosphoinositide-binding protein involved in protein sorting and membrane trafficking in endosomes. Plays a role in cilium biogenesis through regulation of the transport and the localization of proteins to the cilium. Required for the localization to the cilium of V-ATPase subunit ATP6V1D and ATP6V0D1, and RAB8A. Involved in osteoclast differentiation and therefore bone resorption.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Endosome membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome
