UniprotID	Q8TCY5-1
Accession	Q8TCY5;Q5EBR3;Q8TDB7;Q8WXC1;Q8WXC2
EntryName	MRAP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein (B27) (Fat cell-specific low molecular weight protein) (Fat tissue-specific low MW protein)
GeneName	MRAP C21orf61 FALP
Length	173
Function	Modulator of melanocortin receptors (MC1R, MC2R, MC3R, MC4R and MC5R). Acts by increasing ligand-sensitivity of melanocortin receptors and enhancing generation of cAMP by the receptors. Required both for MC2R trafficking to the cell surface of adrenal cells and for signaling in response to corticotropin (ACTH). May be involved in the intracellular trafficking pathways in adipocyte cells.
