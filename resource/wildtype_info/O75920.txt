UniprotID	O75920
Accession	O75920;B7ZKM2;O75919;Q52LK5
EntryName	SERF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small EDRK-rich factor 1 (Protein 4F5) (h4F5) (SMA modifier 1)
GeneName	SERF1A FAM2A SERF1 SMAM1; SERF1B FAM2B SERF1 SMAM1
Length	110
Function	Positive regulator of amyloid protein aggregation and proteotoxicity (PubMed:20723760, PubMed:22854022, PubMed:31034892). Induces conformational changes in amyloid proteins, such as APP, HTT, and SNCA, driving them into compact formations preceding the formation of aggregates (PubMed:20723760, PubMed:22854022, PubMed:31034892).
