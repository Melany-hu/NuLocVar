UniprotID	Q9HCY8
Accession	Q9HCY8;Q5RHT0
EntryName	S10AE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein S100-A14 (S100 calcium-binding protein A14) (S114)
GeneName	S100A14 S100A15
Length	104
Function	Modulates P53/TP53 protein levels, and thereby plays a role in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis. Depending on the context, it can promote cell proliferation or apoptosis. Plays a role in the regulation of cell migration by modulating the levels of MMP2, a matrix protease that is under transcriptional control of P53/TP53. Does not bind calcium.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
