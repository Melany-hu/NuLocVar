UniprotID	P24522-2
Accession	P24522;Q5TCA7;Q5TCA8
EntryName	GA45A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD45 alpha (DNA damage-inducible transcript 1 protein) (DDIT-1)
GeneName	GADD45A DDIT1 GADD45
Length	131
Function	In T-cells, functions as a regulator of p38 MAPKs by inhibiting p88 phosphorylation and activity (By similarity). Might affect PCNA interaction with some CDK (cell division protein kinase) complexes; stimulates DNA excision repair in vitro and inhibits entry of cells into S phase.
