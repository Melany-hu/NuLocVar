UniprotID	O95167
Accession	O95167
EntryName	NDUA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 3 (Complex I-B9) (CI-B9) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B9 subunit)
GeneName	NDUFA3
Length	84
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
