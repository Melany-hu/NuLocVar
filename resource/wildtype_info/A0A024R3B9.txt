UniprotID	A0A024R3B9
Accession	A0A024R3B9
EntryName	A0A024R3B9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-crystallin B chain (Alpha(B)-crystallin)
GeneName	CRYAB hCG_1730741
Length	108
Function	May contribute to the transparency and refractive index of the lens. Has chaperone-like activity, preventing aggregation of various proteins under a wide range of stress conditions. In lens epithelial cells, stabilizes the ATP6V1A protein, preventing its degradation by the proteasome.
