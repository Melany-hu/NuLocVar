UniprotID	Q02577
Accession	Q02577;Q5T1P6
EntryName	HEN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Helix-loop-helix protein 2 (HEN-2) (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 34) (bHLHa34) (Nescient helix loop helix 2) (NSCL-2)
GeneName	NHLH2 BHLHA34 HEN2 KIAA0490
Length	135
Function	Transcription factor which binds the E box motif 5'-CATG-3'. Involved in regulating energy expenditure, body mass, voluntary physical activity, mating behavior and reproductive longevity, acting through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Acts as a transcriptional activator of target genes, including NDN, PCSK1, MC4R (By similarity). Is also a transcriptional activator of KISS1 (PubMed:35066646). May act centrally to regulate function of both white and brown adipose tissue. Together with NHLH1, required to maintain migration and survival of cells in the anterior extramural migration stream (aes), which forms the precerebellar nuclei. Also, in concert with NHLH1, may determine fate of gonadotropin releasing hormone-1 (GnRH-1) neurons.
