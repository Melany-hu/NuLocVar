UniprotID	P63215
Accession	P63215;B2R4S7;P29798;Q61014
EntryName	GBG3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(O) subunit gamma-3
GeneName	GNG3 GNGT3
Length	75
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
