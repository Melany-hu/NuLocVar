UniprotID	C9JXX5
Accession	C9JXX5
EntryName	FREY_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Frey 1 (Frey regulator of sperm-oocyte fusion 1) (FREY1)
GeneName	FREY1 C11orf94 FREY
Length	98
Function	Key regulator for male fertility expressed transiently in round spermatids where it recruits IZUMO1 at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and coordinates the oolemmal binding multimeric complex (IZUMO1 complex) assembly. Upon complete assembly of the IZUMO1 complex, its ER retention is released, facilitating IZUMO1 complex export to the acrosome. Through the interaction with SPPL2C, inhibits its intramembrane protease activity directly accessing the catalytic center of an I-CLiP.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
