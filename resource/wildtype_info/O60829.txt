UniprotID	O60829
Accession	O60829;B2R529;D3DX68;Q6IBI1
EntryName	PAGE4_HUMAN
ProteinName	P antigen family member 4 (PAGE-4) (G antigen family C member 1) (PAGE-1)
GeneName	PAGE4 GAGEC1 JM27
Length	102
Function	Intrinsically disordered protein that potentiates the transcriptional activator activity of JUN (PubMed:24263171, PubMed:28289210). Protects cells from stress-induced apoptosis by inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and via regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway (PubMed:21357425, PubMed:25374899, PubMed:30658679).
