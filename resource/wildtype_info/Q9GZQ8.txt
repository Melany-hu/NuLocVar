EntryName	MLP3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (Autophagy-related protein LC3 B) (Autophagy-related ubiquitin-like modifier LC3 B) (MAP1 light chain 3-like protein 2) (Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B) (MAP1A/MAP1B LC3 B) (MAP1A/MAP1B light chain 3 B)
GeneName	MAP1LC3B MAP1ALC3
Length	125
Function	Ubiquitin-like modifier involved in formation of autophagosomal vacuoles (autophagosomes) (PubMed:20418806, PubMed:23209295, PubMed:28017329). Plays a role in mitophagy which contributes to regulate mitochondrial quantity and quality by eliminating the mitochondria to a basal level to fulfill cellular energy requirements and preventing excess ROS production (PubMed:23209295, PubMed:28017329). In response to cellular stress and upon mitochondria fission, binds C-18 ceramides and anchors autophagolysosomes to outer mitochondrial membranes to eliminate damaged mitochondria (PubMed:22922758). While LC3s are involved in elongation of the phagophore membrane, the GABARAP/GATE-16 subfamily is essential for a later stage in autophagosome maturation (PubMed:20418806, PubMed:23209295, PubMed:28017329). Promotes primary ciliogenesis by removing OFD1 from centriolar satellites via the autophagic pathway (PubMed:24089205). Through its interaction with the reticulophagy receptor TEX264, participates in the remodeling of subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum into autophagosomes upon nutrient stress, which then fuse with lysosomes for endoplasmic reticulum turnover (PubMed:31006537, PubMed:31006538). Upon nutrient stress, directly recruits cofactor JMY to the phagophore membrane surfaces and promotes JMY's actin nucleation activity and autophagosome biogenesis during autophagy (PubMed:30420355).
