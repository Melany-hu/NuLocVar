EntryName	SDHF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 4, mitochondrial (SDH assembly factor 4) (SDHAF4)
GeneName	SDHAF4 C6orf57
Length	108
Function	Plays an essential role in the assembly of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), an enzyme complex (also referred to as respiratory complex II) that is a component of both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and which couples the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with the reduction of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) to ubiquinol (PubMed:24954416). Binds to the flavoprotein subunit SDHA in its FAD-bound form, blocking the generation of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) and facilitating its assembly with the iron-sulfur protein subunit SDHB into the SDH catalytic dimer (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
