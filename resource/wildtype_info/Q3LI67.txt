UniprotID	Q3LI67
Accession	Q3LI67;A4IF26;A4QMZ2
EntryName	KRA63_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 6-3
GeneName	KRTAP6-3 KAP6.3
Length	110
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
