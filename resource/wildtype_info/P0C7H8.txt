UniprotID	P0C7H8
Accession	P0C7H8
EntryName	KRA23_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 2-3 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 2.4) (Keratin-associated protein 2.3)
GeneName	KRTAP2-3 KAP2.3 KRTAP2.3
Length	128
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins (By similarity).
