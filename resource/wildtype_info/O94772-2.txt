UniprotID	O94772-2
Accession	O94772;B2RAD2;J3KQI0;Q6IAX0
EntryName	LY6H_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lymphocyte antigen 6H (Ly-6H)
GeneName	LY6H
Length	161
Function	Believed to act as a modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) activity. In vitro inhibits alpha-3:beta-4-containing nAChRs maximum response. May play a role in the intracellular trafficking of alpha-7-containing nAChRs and may inhibit their expression at the cell surface. Seems to inhibit alpha-7/CHRNA7 signaling in hippocampal neurons.
