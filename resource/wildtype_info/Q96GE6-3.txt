Accession	Q96GE6;B4DL15;F8W6Y4;Q6MZY3;Q6N048;Q9H286
EntryName	CALL4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calmodulin-like protein 4 (Serologically defined breast cancer antigen NY-BR-20)
GeneName	CALML4
Length	81
Function	As part of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex/IMAC plays a role in epithelial brush border differentiation, controlling microvilli organization and length. Acts as a light chain for MYO7B and is required for efficient targeting of the IMAC to the tips of border brush microvilli.
