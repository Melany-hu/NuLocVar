UniprotID	O60927
Accession	O60927
EntryName	PP1RB_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase PPP1R11 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Hemochromatosis candidate gene V protein) (HCG V) (Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 11) (Protein phosphatase inhibitor 3)
GeneName	PPP1R11 HCGV TCTE5
Length	126
Function	Atypical E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which ubiquitinates TLR2 at 'Lys-754' leading to its degradation by the proteasome. Plays a role in regulating inflammatory cytokine release and gram-positive bacterial clearance by functioning, in part, through the ubiquitination and degradation of TLR2 (PubMed:27805901). Inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PubMed:9843442).
