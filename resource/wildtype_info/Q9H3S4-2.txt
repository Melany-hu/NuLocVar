UniprotID	Q9H3S4-2
Accession	Q9H3S4;A8K0T7;D3DWG0;I6L9B8;Q6NUR5;Q9H602
EntryName	TPK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thiamine pyrophosphokinase 1 (hTPK1) (EC 2.7.6.-) (Placental protein 20) (PP20) (Thiamin pyrophosphokinase 1)
GeneName	TPK1
Length	124
Function	Catalyzes the phosphorylation of thiamine to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) utilizing UTP and therefore links the biosynthesis of TPP to pyrimidines metabolism (PubMed:38547260). By producing thiamine pyrophosphate, a cofactor of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase indirectly regulates pyruvate oxidation and lipogenesis (PubMed:38547260). Although it can also catalyze thiamine phosphorylation using ATP and CTP in vitro, it does so with significantly lower efficiency and without physiological relevance evidence (PubMed:11342111, PubMed:38547260).
