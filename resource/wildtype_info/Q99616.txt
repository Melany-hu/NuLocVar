UniprotID	Q99616
Accession	Q99616;O95689;Q6ICQ6
EntryName	CCL13_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 13 (CK-beta-10) (Monocyte chemoattractant protein 4) (Monocyte chemotactic protein 4) (MCP-4) (NCC-1) (Small-inducible cytokine A13) [Cleaved into: C-C motif chemokine 13, long chain; C-C motif chemokine 13, medium chain; C-C motif chemokine 13, short chain]
GeneName	CCL13 MCP4 NCC1 SCYA13
Length	98
Function	Chemotactic factor that attracts monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils and eosinophils, but not neutrophils. Signals through CCR2B and CCR3 receptors. Plays a role in the accumulation of leukocytes at both sides of allergic and non-allergic inflammation. May be involved in the recruitment of monocytes into the arterial wall during the disease process of atherosclerosis. May play a role in the monocyte attraction in tissues chronically exposed to exogenous pathogens.
