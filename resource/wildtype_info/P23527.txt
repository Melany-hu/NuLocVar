UniprotID	P23527
Accession	P23527;Q3KPI7;Q8TCV6
EntryName	H2B1O_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type 1-O (H2B-clustered histone 17) (Histone H2B.2) (Histone H2B.n) (H2B/n)
GeneName	H2BC17 H2BFH H2BFN HIST1H2BO
Length	126
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
