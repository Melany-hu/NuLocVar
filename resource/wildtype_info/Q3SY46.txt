UniprotID	Q3SY46
Accession	Q3SY46;Q3LI78
EntryName	KR133_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 13-3
GeneName	KRTAP13-3 KAP13.3
Length	172
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins (By similarity).
