UniprotID	H0Y5Z9
Accession	H0Y5Z9
EntryName	H0Y5Z9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitotic centromere-associated kinesin
GeneName	KIF2C
Length	107
Function	In complex with KIF18B, constitutes the major microtubule plus-end depolymerizing activity in mitotic cells. Regulates the turnover of microtubules at the kinetochore and functions in chromosome segregation during mitosis. Plays a role in chromosome congression and is required for the lateral to end-on conversion of the chromosome-microtubule attachment.
