Accession	P52926;E7EP85;E7EWA2;Q1M182;Q1M185;Q1M186;Q1M187;Q1M188
EntryName	HMGA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	High mobility group protein HMGI-C (High mobility group AT-hook protein 2)
GeneName	HMGA2 HMGIC
Length	90
Function	Functions as a transcriptional regulator. Functions in cell cycle regulation through CCNA2. Plays an important role in chromosome condensation during the meiotic G2/M transition of spermatocytes. Plays a role in postnatal myogenesis, is involved in satellite cell activation (By similarity). Positively regulates IGF2 expression through PLAG1 and in a PLAG1-independent manner (PubMed:28796236).
