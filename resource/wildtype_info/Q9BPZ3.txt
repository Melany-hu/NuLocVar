UniprotID	Q9BPZ3
Accession	Q9BPZ3;B2RBI1;D3DQC6;Q49A06;Q9H0Y5;Q9P0Q8
EntryName	PAIP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polyadenylate-binding protein-interacting protein 2 (PABP-interacting protein 2) (PAIP-2) (Poly(A)-binding protein-interacting protein 2)
GeneName	PAIP2 PAIP2A HSPC218
Length	127
Function	Acts as a repressor in the regulation of translation initiation of poly(A)-containing mRNAs. Its inhibitory activity on translation is mediated via its action on PABPC1. Displaces the interaction of PABPC1 with poly(A) RNA and competes with PAIP1 for binding to PABPC1. Its association with PABPC1 results in disruption of the cytoplasmic poly(A) RNP structure organization.
