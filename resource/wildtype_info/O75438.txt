UniprotID	O75438
Accession	O75438;A0AV68
EntryName	NDUB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 1 (Complex I-MNLL) (CI-MNLL) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase MNLL subunit)
GeneName	NDUFB1
Length	58
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
