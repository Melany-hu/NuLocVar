UniprotID	Q5T5A8
Accession	Q5T5A8;A1L420
EntryName	LCE3C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Late cornified envelope protein 3C (Late envelope protein 15) (Small proline-rich-like epidermal differentiation complex protein 3A)
GeneName	LCE3C LEP15 SPRL3A
Length	94
Function	A structural component of the cornified envelope of the stratum corneum involved in innate cutaneous host defense (Probable). Possesses defensin-like antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic species. Upon inflammation, may regulate skin barrier repair by shaping cutaneous microbiota composition and immune response to bacterial antigens (PubMed:28634035).
