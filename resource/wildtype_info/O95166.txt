UniprotID	O95166
Accession	O95166
EntryName	GBRAP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABA(A) receptor-associated protein) (MM46)
GeneName	GABARAP FLC3B HT004
Length	117
Function	Ubiquitin-like modifier that plays a role in intracellular transport of GABA(A) receptors and its interaction with the cytoskeleton (PubMed:9892355). Involved in autophagy: while LC3s are involved in elongation of the phagophore membrane, the GABARAP/GATE-16 subfamily is essential for a later stage in autophagosome maturation (PubMed:15169837, PubMed:20562859, PubMed:22948227). Through its interaction with the reticulophagy receptor TEX264, participates in the remodeling of subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum into autophagosomes upon nutrient stress, which then fuse with lysosomes for endoplasmic reticulum turnover (PubMed:31006538). Also required for the local activation of the CUL3(KBTBD6/7) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, regulating ubiquitination and degradation of TIAM1, a guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates RAC1 and downstream signal transduction (PubMed:25684205). Thereby, regulates different biological processes including the organization of the cytoskeleton, cell migration and proliferation (PubMed:25684205). Involved in apoptosis (PubMed:15977068).
