UniprotID	Q8NDV7-4
Accession	Q8NDV7;C9JAR8;O15408;Q658L5;Q6NVB5;Q8NEZ0;Q8TBT8;Q8TCR0;Q9NV59;Q9P268
EntryName	TNR6A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trinucleotide repeat-containing gene 6A protein (CAG repeat protein 26) (EMSY interactor protein) (GW182 autoantigen) (Protein GW1) (Glycine-tryptophan protein of 182 kDa)
GeneName	TNRC6A CAGH26 KIAA1460 TNRC6
Length	161
Function	Plays a role in RNA-mediated gene silencing by both micro-RNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Required for miRNA-dependent repression of translation and for siRNA-dependent endonucleolytic cleavage of complementary mRNAs by argonaute family proteins. As a scaffolding protein, associates with argonaute proteins bound to partially complementary mRNAs, and can simultaneously recruit CCR4-NOT and PAN deadenylase complexes.
