UniprotID	Q6IPU0-2
Accession	Q6IPU0;B3KRA5;B3KS17;Q5T9F8;Q5T9F9
EntryName	CENPP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Centromere protein P (CENP-P)
GeneName	CENPP
Length	115
Function	Component of the CENPA-CAD (nucleosome distal) complex, a complex recruited to centromeres which is involved in assembly of kinetochore proteins, mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. May be involved in incorporation of newly synthesized CENPA into centromeres via its interaction with the CENPA-NAC complex.
