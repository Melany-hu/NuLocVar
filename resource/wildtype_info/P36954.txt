UniprotID	P36954
Accession	P36954;B2R5J2;Q6NW05
EntryName	RPB9_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB9 (RNA polymerase II subunit B9) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit I) (RNA polymerase II 14.5 kDa subunit) (RPB14.5)
GeneName	POLR2I
Length	125
Function	Core component of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. POLR2I/RPB9 is part of the upper jaw surrounding the central large cleft and thought to grab the incoming DNA template.
