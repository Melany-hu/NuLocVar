UniprotID	Q8N257
Accession	Q8N257;A4FU05;Q3ZCP6;Q5TA30
EntryName	H2B3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type 3-B (H2B type 12) (H2B-clustered histone 26) (H2B.U histone 1)
GeneName	H2BC26 H2BU1 HIST3H2BB
Length	126
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
