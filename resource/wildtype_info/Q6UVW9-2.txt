UniprotID	Q6UVW9-2
Accession	Q6UVW9;A5Y4G5;A9QKS2;A9QKS3
EntryName	CLC2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-type lectin domain family 2 member A (Keratinocyte-associated C-type lectin) (KACL) (Proliferation-induced lymphocyte-associated receptor) (PILAR)
GeneName	CLEC2A KACL UNQ5792/PRO19597
Length	160
Function	Membrane-bound protein expressed mainly on keratinocytes which acts as a ligand to stimulate the activating receptor NKp65/KLRF2, expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells (PubMed:25510854). Facilitates thereby dedicated immune recognition of keratinocytes leading to natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity (PubMed:20194751). Also plays a role in modulating the extent of T-cell expansion (PubMed:18550855).
