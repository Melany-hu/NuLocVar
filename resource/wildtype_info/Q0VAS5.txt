UniprotID	Q0VAS5
Accession	Q0VAS5
EntryName	Q0VAS5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H4
GeneName	HIST1H4H
Length	103
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
