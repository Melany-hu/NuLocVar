UniprotID	Q5SV97-2
Accession	Q5SV97;Q6ZVZ7;Q9BRF2;S5G239
EntryName	PERM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	PGC-1 and ERR-induced regulator in muscle protein 1 (PPARGC1 and ESRR-induced regulator in muscle 1) (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 and estrogen-related receptor-induced regulator in muscle 1)
GeneName	PERM1 C1orf170
Length	58
Function	Regulates the expression of selective PPARGC1A/B and ESRRA/B/G target genes with roles in glucose and lipid metabolism, energy transfer, contractile function, muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity. Required for the efficient induction of MT-CO2, MT-CO3, COX4I1, TFB1M, TFB2M, POLRMT and SIRT3 by PPARGC1A. Positively regulates the PPARGC1A/ESRRG-induced expression of CKMT2, TNNI3 and SLC2A4 and negatively regulates the PPARGC1A/ESRRG-induced expression of PDK4.
