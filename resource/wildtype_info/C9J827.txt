UniprotID	C9J827
Accession	C9J827
EntryName	C9J827_HUMAN
ProteinName	WW domain binding protein VOPP1 (EGFR-coamplified and overexpressed protein) (Vesicular, overexpressed in cancer, prosurvival protein 1)
GeneName	VOPP1
Length	109
Function	Increases the transcriptional activity of NFKB1 by facilitating its nuclear translocation, DNA-binding and associated apoptotic response, when overexpressed. May sequester WWOX in lysosomal vesicles and thereby regulate WWOX role as tumor suppressor.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Late endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane
