UniprotID	Q53GA4
Accession	Q53GA4;O00496
EntryName	PHLA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pleckstrin homology-like domain family A member 2 (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome chromosomal region 1 candidate gene C protein) (Imprinted in placenta and liver protein) (Tumor-suppressing STF cDNA 3 protein) (Tumor-suppressing subchromosomal transferable fragment candidate gene 3 protein) (p17-Beckwith-Wiedemann region 1 C) (p17-BWR1C)
GeneName	PHLDA2 BWR1C HLDA2 IPL TSSC3
Length	152
Function	Plays a role in regulating placenta growth. May act via its PH domain that competes with other PH domain-containing proteins, thereby preventing their binding to membrane lipids (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Membrane
