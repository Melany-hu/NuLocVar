EntryName	CASP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caspase-4 (CASP-4) (EC 3.4.22.57) (ICE and Ced-3 homolog 2) (ICH-2) (ICE(rel)-II) (Mih1) (Protease TX) [Cleaved into: Caspase-4 subunit p10; Caspase-4 subunit p20]
GeneName	CASP4 ICH2
Length	321
Function	Inflammatory caspase that acts as the effector of the non-canonical inflammasome by mediating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pyroptosis (PubMed:25119034, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:32109412, PubMed:34671164, PubMed:37001519, PubMed:37993712, PubMed:37993714). Also indirectly activates the NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasomes (PubMed:23516580, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:32109412, PubMed:7797510). Acts as a thiol protease that cleaves a tetrapeptide after an Asp residue at position P1: catalyzes cleavage of CGAS, GSDMD and IL18 (PubMed:15326478, PubMed:23516580, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:28314590, PubMed:32109412, PubMed:37993712, PubMed:37993714, PubMed:7797510). Effector of the non-canonical inflammasome independently of NLRP3 inflammasome and CASP1: the non-canonical inflammasome promotes pyroptosis through GSDMD cleavage without involving secretion of cytokine IL1B (PubMed:25119034, PubMed:25121752, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:31268602, PubMed:32109412, PubMed:37993712, PubMed:37993714). In the non-canonical inflammasome, CASP4 is activated by direct binding to the lipid A moiety of LPS without the need of an upstream sensor (PubMed:25119034, PubMed:25121752, PubMed:29520027, PubMed:32510692, PubMed:32581219, PubMed:37993712). LPS-binding promotes CASP4 activation and CASP4-mediated cleavage of GSDMD and IL18, followed by IL18 secretion through the GSDMD pore, pyroptosis of infected cells and their extrusion into the gut lumen (PubMed:25119034, PubMed:25121752, PubMed:37993712, PubMed:37993714). Also indirectly promotes secretion of mature cytokines (IL1A and HMGB1) downstream of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis via activation of the NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasomes (PubMed:26375003, PubMed:32109412). Involved in NLRP3-dependent CASP1 activation and IL1B secretion in response to non-canonical activators, such as UVB radiation or cholera enterotoxin (PubMed:22246630, PubMed:23516580, PubMed:24879791, PubMed:25964352, PubMed:26173988, PubMed:26174085, PubMed:26508369). Involved in NLRP6 inflammasome-dependent activation in response to lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell-wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, which leads to CASP1 activation and IL1B secretion (PubMed:33377178). Involved in LPS-induced IL6 secretion; this activity may not require caspase enzymatic activity (PubMed:26508369). The non-canonical inflammasome is required for innate immunity to cytosolic, but not vacuolar, bacteria (By similarity). Plays a crucial role in the restriction of S.typhimurium replication in colonic epithelial cells during infection (PubMed:25121752, PubMed:25964352). Activation of the non-canonical inflammasome in brain endothelial cells can lead to excessive pyroptosis, leading to blood-brain barrier breakdown (By similarity). Pyroptosis limits bacterial replication, while cytokine secretion promotes the recruitment and activation of immune cells and triggers mucosal inflammation (PubMed:25121752, PubMed:25964352, PubMed:26375003). May also act as an activator of adaptive immunity in dendritic cells, following activation by oxidized phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, an oxidized phospholipid (oxPAPC) (By similarity). Involved in cell death induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress and by treatment with cytotoxic APP peptides found in Alzheimer's patient brains (PubMed:15123740, PubMed:22246630, PubMed:23661706). Cleavage of GSDMD is not strictly dependent on the consensus cleavage site but depends on an exosite interface on CASP4 that recognizes and binds the Gasdermin-D, C-terminal (GSDMD-CT) part (PubMed:32109412). Catalyzes cleavage and maturation of IL18; IL18 processing also depends of the exosite interface on CASP4 (PubMed:15326478, PubMed:37993712, PubMed:37993714). In contrast, it does not directly process IL1B (PubMed:7743998, PubMed:7797510, PubMed:7797592). During non-canonical inflammasome activation, cuts CGAS and may play a role in the regulation of antiviral innate immune activation (PubMed:28314590).
