UniprotID	P05113
Accession	P05113;Q13840
EntryName	IL5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-5 (IL-5) (B-cell differentiation factor I) (Eosinophil differentiation factor) (T-cell replacing factor) (TRF)
GeneName	IL5
Length	134
Function	Homodimeric cytokine expressed predominantly by T-lymphocytes and NK cells that plays an important role in the survival, differentiation, and chemotaxis of eosinophils (PubMed:2653458, PubMed:9010276). Also acts on activated and resting B-cells to induce immunoglobulin production, growth, and differentiation (By similarity). Mechanistically, exerts its biological effects through a receptor composed of IL5RA subunit and the cytokine receptor common subunit beta/CSF2RB (PubMed:1495999, PubMed:22528658). Binding to the receptor leads to activation of various kinases including LYN, SYK and JAK2 and thereby propagates signals through the RAS-MAPK and JAK-STAT5 pathways respectively (PubMed:7613138).
