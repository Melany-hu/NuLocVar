UniprotID	O95925
Accession	O95925;A6PVD6;Q86TP9;Q96SD7;Q9HD30
EntryName	EPPI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eppin (Cancer/testis antigen 71) (CT71) (Epididymal protease inhibitor) (Protease inhibitor WAP7) (Serine protease inhibitor-like with Kunitz and WAP domains 1) (WAP four-disulfide core domain protein 7)
GeneName	EPPIN SPINLW1 WAP7 WFDC7
Length	133
Function	Serine protease inhibitor that plays an essential role in male reproduction and fertility. Modulates the hydrolysis of SEMG1 by KLK3/PSA (a serine protease), provides antimicrobial protection for spermatozoa in the ejaculate coagulum, and binds SEMG1 thereby inhibiting sperm motility.
