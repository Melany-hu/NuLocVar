UniprotID	P07737
Accession	P07737;Q53Y44
EntryName	PROF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Profilin-1 (Epididymis tissue protein Li 184a) (Profilin I)
GeneName	PFN1
Length	140
Function	Binds to actin and affects the structure of the cytoskeleton. At high concentrations, profilin prevents the polymerization of actin, whereas it enhances it at low concentrations. By binding to PIP2, it inhibits the formation of IP3 and DG. Inhibits androgen receptor (AR) and HTT aggregation and binding of G-actin is essential for its inhibition of AR.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
