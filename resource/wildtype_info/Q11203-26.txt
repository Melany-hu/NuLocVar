EntryName	SIAT6_HUMAN
ProteinName	CMP-N-acetylneuraminate-beta-1,4-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.3.6) (Beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 3) (Alpha 2,3-ST 3) (Gal beta-1,3(4) GlcNAc alpha-2,3 sialyltransferase) (N-acetyllactosaminide alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase) (ST3Gal III) (ST3GalIII) (ST3N) (Sialyltransferase 6)
GeneName	ST3GAL3 SIAT6
Length	73
Function	Catalyzes the formation of the NeuAc-alpha-2,3-Gal-beta-1,4-GlcNAc-, NeuAc-alpha-2,3-Gal-beta-1,3-GlcNAc- and NeuAc-alpha-2,3-Gal-beta-1,3-GalNAc- sequences found in terminal carbohydrate groups of glycoproteins and glycolipids. The highest activity is toward Gal-beta-1,3-GlcNAc and the lowest toward Gal-beta-1,3-GalNAc.
