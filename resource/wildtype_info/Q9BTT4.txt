UniprotID	Q9BTT4
Accession	Q9BTT4;C6G491
EntryName	MED10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 10 (Mediator complex subunit 10) (Transformation-related gene 17 protein) (TRG-17) (Transformation-related gene 20 protein) (TRG-20)
GeneName	MED10 L6 TRG17 TRG20
Length	135
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
