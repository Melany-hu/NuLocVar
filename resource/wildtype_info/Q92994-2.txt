EntryName	TF3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor IIIB 90 kDa subunit (TFIIIB90) (hTFIIIB90) (B-related factor 1) (BRF-1) (hBRF) (TAF3B2) (TATA box-binding protein-associated factor, RNA polymerase III, subunit 2)
GeneName	BRF1 BRF GTF3B TAF3B2 TAF3C
Length	134
Function	General activator of RNA polymerase which utilizes different TFIIIB complexes at structurally distinct promoters. The isoform 1 is involved in the transcription of tRNA, adenovirus VA1, 7SL and 5S RNA. Isoform 2 is required for transcription of the U6 promoter.
