UniprotID	Q9NRY2
Accession	Q9NRY2;Q5VWJ7;Q96E04;Q9P090
EntryName	SOSSC_HUMAN
ProteinName	SOSS complex subunit C (INTS3- and NABP-interacting protein) (Sensor of single-strand DNA complex subunit C) (Sensor of ssDNA subunit C) (SOSS-C) (Single-stranded DNA-binding protein-interacting protein 1) (SSB-interacting protein 1) (hSSBIP1)
GeneName	INIP C9orf80 SSBIP1 HSPC043 HSPC291
Length	104
Function	Component of the SOSS complex, a multiprotein complex that functions downstream of the MRN complex to promote DNA repair and G2/M checkpoint. The SOSS complex associates with single-stranded DNA at DNA lesions and influences diverse endpoints in the cellular DNA damage response including cell-cycle checkpoint activation, recombinational repair and maintenance of genomic stability. Required for efficient homologous recombination-dependent repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and ATM-dependent signaling pathways.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
