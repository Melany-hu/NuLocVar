UniprotID	Q9GZM3
Accession	Q9GZM3;F6W009;Q9H1A8
EntryName	RPB1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB11-b1 (RNA polymerase II subunit B11-b1) (RPB11b1) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit J2)
GeneName	POLR2J2
Length	115
Function	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB11 is part of the core element with the central large cleft (By similarity).
