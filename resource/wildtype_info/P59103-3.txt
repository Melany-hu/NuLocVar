UniprotID	P59103-3
Accession	P59103;A6NKG7;Q0VAE6;Q5VX59;Q86Y17;Q8IWM4
EntryName	DAOA_HUMAN
ProteinName	D-amino acid oxidase regulator (Protein G72)
GeneName	DAOA G72
Length	82
Function	May suppress DAO (D-amino acid oxidase) and SOD1 activity and promote their degradation (PubMed:18544534, PubMed:20521334, PubMed:21679769, PubMed:30037290). Has conversely also been suggested to function as a DAO activator (PubMed:12364586, PubMed:24362575, PubMed:29114206). May stimulate the degradation of DDO (D-aspartate oxidase) (PubMed:37805834). May play a role in mitochondrial fission (PubMed:17684499).
