EntryName	VKOR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (EC 1.17.4.4) (Vitamin K1 2,3-epoxide reductase subunit 1)
GeneName	VKORC1 VKOR MSTP134 MSTP576 UNQ308/PRO351
Length	92
Function	Involved in vitamin K metabolism. Catalytic subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) complex which reduces inactive vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to active vitamin K. Vitamin K is required for the gamma-carboxylation of various proteins, including clotting factors, and is required for normal blood coagulation, but also for normal bone development.
