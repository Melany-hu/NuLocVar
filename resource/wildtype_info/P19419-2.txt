Accession	P19419;B2R7H4;O75606;O95058;Q969X8;Q9UJM4
EntryName	ELK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ETS domain-containing protein Elk-1
GeneName	ELK1
Length	95
Function	Transcription factor that binds to purine-rich DNA sequences (PubMed:10799319, PubMed:7889942). Forms a ternary complex with SRF and the ETS and SRF motifs of the serum response element (SRE) on the promoter region of immediate early genes such as FOS and IER2 (PubMed:1630903). Induces target gene transcription upon JNK and MAPK-signaling pathways stimulation (PubMed:7889942).
