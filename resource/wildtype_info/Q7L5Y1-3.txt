EntryName	ENOF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial enolase superfamily member 1 (EC 4.2.1.68) (Antisense RNA to thymidylate synthase) (rTS) (L-fuconate dehydratase)
GeneName	ENOSF1 RTS TYMSAS
Length	117
Function	Plays a role in the catabolism of L-fucose, a sugar that is part of the carbohydrates that are attached to cellular glycoproteins. Catalyzes the dehydration of L-fuconate to 2-keto-3-deoxy-L-fuconate by the abstraction of the 2-proton to generate an enediolate intermediate that is stabilized by the magnesium ion (PubMed:24697329).
