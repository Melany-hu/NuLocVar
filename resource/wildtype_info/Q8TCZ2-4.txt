EntryName	C99L2_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD99 antigen-like protein 2 (MIC2-like protein 1) (CD antigen CD99)
GeneName	CD99L2 MIC2L1 UNQ1964/PRO4486
Length	145
Function	Plays a role in a late step of leukocyte extravasation helping cells to overcome the endothelial basement membrane. Acts at the same site as, but independently of, PECAM1 (By similarity). Homophilic adhesion molecule, but these interactions may not be required for cell aggregation (By similarity).
