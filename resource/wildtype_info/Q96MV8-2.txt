Accession	Q96MV8;B3KVG7;Q3SY30;Q6UWH3
EntryName	ZDH15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC15 (EC 2.3.1.225) (Acyltransferase ZDHHC15) (EC 2.3.1.-) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 15) (DHHC-15)
GeneName	ZDHHC15 UNQ1969/PRO4501
Length	143
Function	Palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of palmitate onto various protein substrates (PubMed:18817523, PubMed:23034182). Has no stringent fatty acid selectivity and in addition to palmitate can also transfer onto target proteins myristate from tetradecanoyl-CoA and stearate from octadecanoyl-CoA (By similarity). Palmitoylates IGF2R and SORT1, promoting their partitioning to an endosomal membrane subdomain where they can interact with the retromer cargo-selective complex (PubMed:18817523). Thereby, regulates retrograde transport from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus of these lysosomal sorting receptors and plays a role in trafficking of lysosomal proteins (PubMed:18817523). In the nervous system, catalyzes the palmitoylation of DLG4/PSD95 and regulates its synaptic clustering and function in synaptogenesis (By similarity). Could be involved in the differentiation of dopaminergic neurons and the development of the diencephalon (By similarity). Could also catalyze the palmitoylation of GAP43 (By similarity). Could also palmitoylate DNAJC5 and regulate its localization to the Golgi membrane (By similarity). Could also palmitoylate FYN as shown in vitro (PubMed:19956733). May palmitoylate CALHM3 subunit of gustatory voltage-gated ion channels and modulate channel gating and kinetics.
