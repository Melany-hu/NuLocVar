UniprotID	O96033
Accession	O96033
EntryName	MOC2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Molybdopterin synthase sulfur carrier subunit (MOCO1-A) (Molybdenum cofactor synthesis protein 2 small subunit) (Molybdenum cofactor synthesis protein 2A) (MOCS2A) (Molybdopterin-synthase small subunit) (Sulfur carrier protein MOCS2A)
GeneName	MOCS2 MOCO1
Length	88
Function	Acts as a sulfur carrier required for molybdopterin biosynthesis. Component of the molybdopterin synthase complex that catalyzes the conversion of precursor Z into molybdopterin by mediating the incorporation of 2 sulfur atoms into precursor Z to generate a dithiolene group. In the complex, serves as sulfur donor by being thiocarboxylated (-COSH) at its C-terminus by MOCS3. After interaction with MOCS2B, the sulfur is then transferred to precursor Z to form molybdopterin.
