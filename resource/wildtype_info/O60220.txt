UniprotID	O60220
Accession	O60220;B2R5A6;Q6IRW6
EntryName	TIM8A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim8 A (Deafness dystonia protein 1) (X-linked deafness dystonia protein)
GeneName	TIMM8A DDP DDP1 TIM8A
Length	97
Function	Mitochondrial intermembrane chaperone that participates in the import and insertion of some multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Also required for the transfer of beta-barrel precursors from the TOM complex to the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) of the outer membrane. Acts as a chaperone-like protein that protects the hydrophobic precursors from aggregation and guide them through the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The TIMM8-TIMM13 complex mediates the import of proteins such as TIMM23, SLC25A12/ARALAR1 and SLC25A13/ARALAR2, while the predominant TIMM9-TIMM10 70 kDa complex mediates the import of much more proteins. Probably necessary for normal neurologic development.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
