UniprotID	P29466-5
Accession	P29466;B5MDZ1;Q53EY6;Q6DMQ1;Q6GSS3;Q6PI75;Q9UCN3
EntryName	CASP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caspase-1 (CASP-1) (EC 3.4.22.36) (Interleukin-1 beta convertase) (IL-1BC) (Interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme) (ICE) (IL-1 beta-converting enzyme) (p45) [Cleaved into: Caspase-1 subunit p20; Caspase-1 subunit p10]
GeneName	CASP1 IL1BC IL1BCE
Length	88
Function	Thiol protease involved in a variety of inflammatory processes by proteolytically cleaving other proteins, such as the precursors of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) and interleukin 18 (IL18) as well as the pyroptosis inducer Gasdermin-D (GSDMD), into active mature peptides (PubMed:15326478, PubMed:15498465, PubMed:1574116, PubMed:26375003, PubMed:32051255, PubMed:37993714, PubMed:7876192, PubMed:9334240). Plays a key role in cell immunity as an inflammatory response initiator: once activated through formation of an inflammasome complex, it initiates a pro-inflammatory response through the cleavage of the two inflammatory cytokines IL1B and IL18, releasing the mature cytokines which are involved in a variety of inflammatory processes (PubMed:15326478, PubMed:15498465, PubMed:1574116, PubMed:32051255, PubMed:7876192). Cleaves a tetrapeptide after an Asp residue at position P1 (PubMed:15498465, PubMed:1574116, PubMed:7876192). Also initiates pyroptosis, a programmed lytic cell death pathway, through cleavage of GSDMD (PubMed:26375003). In contrast to cleavage of interleukin IL1B, recognition and cleavage of GSDMD is not strictly dependent on the consensus cleavage site but depends on an exosite interface on CASP1 that recognizes and binds the Gasdermin-D, C-terminal (GSDMD-CT) part (PubMed:32051255, PubMed:32109412, PubMed:32553275). Cleaves and activates CASP7 in response to bacterial infection, promoting plasma membrane repair (PubMed:22464733). Upon inflammasome activation, during DNA virus infection but not RNA virus challenge, controls antiviral immunity through the cleavage of CGAS, rendering it inactive (PubMed:28314590). In apoptotic cells, cleaves SPHK2 which is released from cells and remains enzymatically active extracellularly (PubMed:20197547).
