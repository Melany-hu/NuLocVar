UniprotID	Q9BW61
Accession	Q9BW61
EntryName	DDA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	DET1- and DDB1-associated protein 1 (Placenta cross-immune reaction antigen 1) (PCIA-1)
GeneName	DDA1 C19orf58 PCIA1
Length	102
Function	Functions as a component of numerous distinct DCX (DDB1-CUL4-X-box) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes which mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:17452440, PubMed:28302793, PubMed:28437394, PubMed:31686031, PubMed:31819272). In the DCX complexes, acts as a scaffolding subunit required to stabilize the complex (PubMed:31686031, PubMed:31819272).
