UniprotID	Q9UBM4
Accession	Q9UBM4;Q5T2G4
EntryName	OPT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Opticin (Oculoglycan)
GeneName	OPTC OPT
Length	332
Function	Inhibits angiogenesis in the vitreous humor of the eye, and therefore represses neovascularization (By similarity). Binds collagen fibrils (By similarity). May be involved in collagen fiber organization via regulation of other members of the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan superfamily (By similarity).
