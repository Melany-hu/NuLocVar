UniprotID	Q14582
Accession	Q14582;A2A335;Q5TZX4
EntryName	MAD4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Max dimerization protein 4 (Max dimerizer 4) (Class C basic helix-loop-helix protein 12) (bHLHc12) (Max-associated protein 4) (Max-interacting transcriptional repressor MAD4)
GeneName	MXD4 BHLHC12 MAD4
Length	209
Function	Transcriptional repressor. Binds with MAX to form a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein complex which recognizes the core sequence 5'-CACTG-3'. Antagonizes MYC transcriptional activity by competing for MAX and suppresses MYC dependent cell transformation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
