UniprotID	O43237
Accession	O43237;A8K6V1;B4DZP4;Q8TAT3
EntryName	DC1L2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytoplasmic dynein 1 light intermediate chain 2 (Dynein light intermediate chain 2, cytosolic) (LIC-2) (LIC53/55)
GeneName	DYNC1LI2 DNCLI2 LIC2
Length	492
Function	Acts as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex that are thought to be involved in linking dynein to cargos and to adapter proteins that regulate dynein function. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. May play a role in binding dynein to membranous organelles or chromosomes.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
