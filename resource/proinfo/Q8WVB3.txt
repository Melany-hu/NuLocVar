EntryName	HEXD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hexosaminidase D (EC 3.2.1.52) (Beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase) (Beta-hexosaminidase D) (Hexosaminidase domain-containing protein) (N-acetyl-beta-galactosaminidase)
GeneName	HEXD HEXDC
Length	486
Function	Has hexosaminidase activity. Responsible for the cleavage of the monosaccharides N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from cellular substrates. Has a preference for galactosaminide over glucosaminide substrates (PubMed:27149221).
