UniprotID	O75015
Accession	O75015
EntryName	FCG3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Low affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor III-B (Fc-gamma RIII-beta) (CD16-I) (Fc-gamma RIII) (Fc-gamma RIIIb) (FcRIII) (FcRIIIb) (FcR-10) (IgG Fc receptor III-1) (CD antigen CD16b)
GeneName	FCGR3B CD16B FCG3 FCGR3 IGFR3
Length	233
Function	Receptor for the Fc region of immunoglobulins gamma. Low affinity receptor. Binds complexed or aggregated IgG and also monomeric IgG. Contrary to III-A, is not capable to mediate antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. May serve as a trap for immune complexes in the peripheral circulation which does not activate neutrophils.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted
