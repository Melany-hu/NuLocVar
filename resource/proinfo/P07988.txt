UniprotID	P07988
Accession	P07988;Q96R04
EntryName	PSPB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pulmonary surfactant-associated protein B (SP-B) (18 kDa pulmonary-surfactant protein) (6 kDa protein) (Pulmonary surfactant-associated proteolipid SPL(Phe))
GeneName	SFTPB SFTP3
Length	381
Function	Pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins promote alveolar stability by lowering the surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the peripheral air spaces. SP-B increases the collapse pressure of palmitic acid to nearly 70 millinewtons per meter.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Extracellular space; Surface film
