UniprotID	Q13886
Accession	Q13886;B2R943;Q16196
EntryName	KLF9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Krueppel-like factor 9 (Basic transcription element-binding protein 1) (BTE-binding protein 1) (GC-box-binding protein 1) (Transcription factor BTEB1)
GeneName	KLF9 BTEB BTEB1
Length	244
Function	Transcription factor that binds to GC box promoter elements. Selectively activates mRNA synthesis from genes containing tandem repeats of GC boxes but represses genes with a single GC box. Acts as an epidermal circadian transcription factor regulating keratinocyte proliferation (PubMed:22711835).
