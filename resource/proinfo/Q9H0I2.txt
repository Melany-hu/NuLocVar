Length	346
Function	Microtubule-binding protein which regulates microtubule organization and stability (PubMed:35072334, PubMed:35197565). Promotes the stability of astral microtubules and facilitates the proper orientation of the mitotic spindle (PubMed:35197565). This allows the oriented division of basal keratinocytes and contributes to epidermal stratification (By similarity). Required for the assembly of both primary and motile cilia (PubMed:35301795). Destabilizes the interaction between CCP110 and CEP97 by competing with CEP97 for binding to CCP110 which promotes the removal of CCP110 and CEP97 from the mother centriole and allows the initiation of ciliogenesis (PubMed:35301795).
