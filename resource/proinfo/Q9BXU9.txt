UniprotID	Q9BXU9
Accession	Q9BXU9;J3KQA7
EntryName	CABP8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium-binding protein 8 (CaBP8) (Calneuron I) (Calneuron-1)
GeneName	CALN1 CABP8
Length	261
Function	Negatively regulates Golgi-to-plasma membrane trafficking by interacting with PI4KB and inhibiting its activity. May play a role in the physiology of neurons and is potentially important in memory and learning.
