EntryName	ATPA_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP synthase F(1) complex subunit alpha, mitochondrial (ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha)
GeneName	ATP5F1A ATP5A ATP5A1 ATP5AL2 ATPM
Length	553
Function	Subunit alpha, of the mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase complex (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) that produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain (Probable). ATP synthase complex consist of a soluble F(1) head domain - the catalytic core - and a membrane F(1) domain - the membrane proton channel (PubMed:37244256). These two domains are linked by a central stalk rotating inside the F(1) region and a stationary peripheral stalk (PubMed:37244256). During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation (Probable). In vivo, can only synthesize ATP although its ATP hydrolase activity can be activated artificially in vitro (By similarity). With the catalytic subunit beta (ATP5F1B), forms the catalytic core in the F(1) domain (PubMed:37244256). Subunit alpha does not bear the catalytic high-affinity ATP-binding sites (Probable). Binds the bacterial siderophore enterobactin and can promote mitochondrial accumulation of enterobactin-derived iron ions (PubMed:30146159).
