EntryName	PLPP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polyisoprenoid diphosphate/phosphate phosphohydrolase PLPP6 (EC 3.1.3.-) (EC 3.6.1.-) (EC 3.6.1.68) (Lipid phosphatase-related protein-B) (LPRP-B) (PA-PSP) (Phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 domain-containing protein 2) (PPAP2 domain-containing protein 2) (Phospholipid phosphatase 6) (Presqualene diphosphate phosphatase) (Type 1 polyisoprenoid diphosphate phosphatase)
GeneName	PLPP6 PDP1 PPAPDC2
Length	295
Function	Magnesium-independent polyisoprenoid diphosphatase that catalyzes the sequential dephosphorylation of presqualene, farnesyl, geranyl and geranylgeranyl diphosphates (PubMed:16464866, PubMed:19220020, PubMed:20110354). Functions in the innate immune response through the dephosphorylation of presqualene diphosphate which acts as a potent inhibitor of the signaling pathways contributing to polymorphonuclear neutrophils activation (PubMed:16464866, PubMed:23568778). May regulate the biosynthesis of cholesterol and related sterols by dephosphorylating presqualene and farnesyl diphosphate, two key intermediates in this biosynthetic pathway (PubMed:20110354). May also play a role in protein prenylation by acting on farnesyl diphosphate and its derivative geranylgeranyl diphosphate, two precursors for the addition of isoprenoid anchors to membrane proteins (PubMed:20110354). Has a lower activity towards phosphatidic acid (PA), but through phosphatidic acid dephosphorylation may participate in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerols (PubMed:18930839). May also act on ceramide-1-P, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphing-4-enine 1-phosphate/sphingosine-1-phosphate (PubMed:18930839, PubMed:20110354).
