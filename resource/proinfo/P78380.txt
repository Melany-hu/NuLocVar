Accession	P78380;A8K7V9;B4DI48;G3V1I4;Q2PP00;Q7Z484
EntryName	OLR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (Ox-LDL receptor 1) (C-type lectin domain family 8 member A) (Lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor 1) (LOX-1) (Lectin-like oxLDL receptor 1) (hLOX-1) (Lectin-type oxidized LDL receptor 1) [Cleaved into: Oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1, soluble form]
GeneName	OLR1 CLEC8A LOX1
Length	273
Function	Receptor that mediates the recognition, internalization and degradation of oxidatively modified low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) by vascular endothelial cells. OxLDL is a marker of atherosclerosis that induces vascular endothelial cell activation and dysfunction, resulting in pro-inflammatory responses, pro-oxidative conditions and apoptosis. Its association with oxLDL induces the activation of NF-kappa-B through an increased production of intracellular reactive oxygen and a variety of pro-atherogenic cellular responses including a reduction of nitric oxide (NO) release, monocyte adhesion and apoptosis. In addition to binding oxLDL, it acts as a receptor for the HSP70 protein involved in antigen cross-presentation to naive T-cells in dendritic cells, thereby participating in cell-mediated antigen cross-presentation. Also involved in inflammatory process, by acting as a leukocyte-adhesion molecule at the vascular interface in endotoxin-induced inflammation. Also acts as a receptor for advanced glycation end (AGE) products, activated platelets, monocytes, apoptotic cells and both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
