UniprotID	P36507
Accession	P36507
EntryName	MP2K2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 2 (MAP kinase kinase 2) (MAPKK 2) (EC 2.7.12.2) (ERK activator kinase 2) (MAPK/ERK kinase 2) (MEK 2)
GeneName	MAP2K2 MEK2 MKK2 PRKMK2
Length	400
Function	Catalyzes the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in a Thr-Glu-Tyr sequence located in MAP kinases. Activates the ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases (By similarity). Activates BRAF in a KSR1 or KSR2-dependent manner; by binding to KSR1 or KSR2 releases the inhibitory intramolecular interaction between KSR1 or KSR2 protein kinase and N-terminal domains which promotes KSR1 or KSR2-BRAF dimerization and BRAF activation (PubMed:29433126).
