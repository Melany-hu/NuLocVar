UniprotID	F5H459
Accession	F5H459
EntryName	F5H459_HUMAN
ProteinName	AP complex subunit sigma
GeneName	AP3S1
Length	162
Function	Part of the AP-3 complex, an adaptor-related complex which is not clathrin-associated. The complex is associated with the Golgi region as well as more peripheral structures. It facilitates the budding of vesicles from the Golgi membrane and may be directly involved in trafficking to lysosomes. In concert with the BLOC-1 complex, AP-3 is required to target cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals.
