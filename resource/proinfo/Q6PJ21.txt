EntryName	SPSB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	SPRY domain-containing SOCS box protein 3 (SSB-3)
GeneName	SPSB3 C16orf31 SSB3
Length	355
Function	Substrate-recognition component of a cullin-5-RING E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (ECS complex, also named CRL5 complex), which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, such as CGAS and SNAI1 (PubMed:29059170, PubMed:38418882). The ECS(SPSB3) complex catalyzes 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination of nuclear CGAS in cycling cells, leading to its degradation (PubMed:38418882). Recognizes and binds nucleosome-bound CGAS: ubiquitination and degradation of nuclear CGAS during G1 and G2 phases is required to promote low intranuclear CGAS abundance before the next mitotic cycle (PubMed:38418882). The ECS(SPSB3) complex also mediates ubiquitination and degradation of phosphorylated SNAI1 (PubMed:29059170).
