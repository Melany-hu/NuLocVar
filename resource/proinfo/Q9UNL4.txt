EntryName	ING4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inhibitor of growth protein 4 (p29ING4)
GeneName	ING4 My036
Length	249
Function	Component of HBO1 complexes, which specifically mediate acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-14' (H3K14ac), and have reduced activity toward histone H4 (PubMed:16387653). Through chromatin acetylation it may function in DNA replication (PubMed:16387653). May inhibit tumor progression by modulating the transcriptional output of signaling pathways which regulate cell proliferation (PubMed:15251430, PubMed:15528276). Can suppress brain tumor angiogenesis through transcriptional repression of RELA/NFKB3 target genes when complexed with RELA (PubMed:15029197). May also specifically suppress loss of contact inhibition elicited by activated oncogenes such as MYC (PubMed:15029197). Represses hypoxia inducible factor's (HIF) activity by interacting with HIF prolyl hydroxylase 2 (EGLN1) (PubMed:15897452). Can enhance apoptosis induced by serum starvation in mammary epithelial cell line HC11 (By similarity).
