EntryName	FLVC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Choline/ethanolamine transporter FLVCR1 (Feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor-related protein 1) (Feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor) (hFLVCR) (Heme transporter FLVCR1)
GeneName	FLVCR1 FLVCR
Length	555
Function	Uniporter that mediates the transport of extracellular choline and ethanolamine into cells, thereby playing a key role in phospholipid biosynthesis (PubMed:37100056, PubMed:38693265, PubMed:38778100). Choline and ethanolamine are the precursors of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively, the two most abundant phospholipids (PubMed:38693265, PubMed:38778100). Transport is not coupled with proton transport and is exclusively driven by the choline (or ethanolamine) gradient across the plasma membrane (PubMed:38693265, PubMed:38778100). Also acts as a heme b transporter that mediates heme efflux from the cytoplasm to the extracellular compartment (PubMed:15369674, PubMed:20610401, PubMed:22483575, PubMed:23187127, PubMed:27923065).
