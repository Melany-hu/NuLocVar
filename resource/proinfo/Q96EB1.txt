UniprotID	Q96EB1
Accession	Q96EB1;B4E3W0;E7EPZ6;Q9H4E8;Q9NX11
EntryName	ELP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Elongator complex protein 4 (hELP4) (PAX6 neighbor gene protein)
GeneName	ELP4 C11orf19 PAXNEB
Length	424
Function	Component of the elongator complex which is required for multiple tRNA modifications, including mcm5U (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl uridine), mcm5s2U (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine), and ncm5U (5-carbamoylmethyl uridine) (PubMed:29332244). The elongator complex catalyzes the formation of carboxymethyluridine in the wobble base at position 34 in tRNAs (PubMed:29332244).
