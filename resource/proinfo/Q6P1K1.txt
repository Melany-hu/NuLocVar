UniprotID	Q6P1K1
Accession	Q6P1K1;Q9BUB3;Q9NX17
EntryName	HRG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heme transporter HRG1 (Heme-responsive gene 1 protein homolog) (HRG-1) (hHRG-1) (Solute carrier family 48 member 1)
GeneName	SLC48A1 HRG1
Length	146
Function	Heme transporter that regulates intracellular heme availability through the endosomal or lysosomal compartment (PubMed:18418376). In macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system, is the heme transporter for heme-iron recycling. Essential for macrophage iron homeostasis, transports heme from the phagolysosome to the cytoplasm during erythrophagocytosis (EP) (PubMed:23395172).
Subcellular Location	Endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Phagosome membrane
