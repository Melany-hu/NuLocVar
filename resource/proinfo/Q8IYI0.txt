UniprotID	Q8IYI0
Accession	Q8IYI0;A8K9J3;Q5TGA9;Q96LU1
EntryName	SHLD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Shieldin complex subunit 1 (RINN1-REV7-interacting novel NHEJ regulator 3) (Shield complex subunit 1)
GeneName	SHLD1 C20orf196 RINN3
Length	205
Function	Component of the shieldin complex, which plays an important role in repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs). During G1 and S phase of the cell cycle, the complex functions downstream of TP53BP1 to promote non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and suppress DNA end resection. Mediates various NHEJ-dependent processes including immunoglobulin class-switch recombination, and fusion of unprotected telomeres.
Subcellular Location	Chromosome
