EntryName	SCD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (hSCD1) (EC 1.14.19.1) (Acyl-CoA desaturase) (Delta(9)-desaturase) (Delta-9 desaturase) (Fatty acid desaturase)
GeneName	SCD FADS5 SCD1 SCDOS
Length	359
Function	Stearoyl-CoA desaturase that utilizes O(2) and electrons from reduced cytochrome b5 to introduce the first double bond into saturated fatty acyl-CoA substrates (PubMed:15907797, PubMed:18765284). Catalyzes the insertion of a cis double bond at the delta-9 position into fatty acyl-CoA substrates including palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA (PubMed:15907797, PubMed:18765284). Gives rise to a mixture of 16:1 and 18:1 unsaturated fatty acids (PubMed:15610069). Plays an important role in lipid biosynthesis. Plays an important role in regulating the expression of genes that are involved in lipogenesis and in regulating mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (By similarity). Plays an important role in body energy homeostasis (By similarity). Contributes to the biosynthesis of membrane phospholipids, cholesterol esters and triglycerides (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
