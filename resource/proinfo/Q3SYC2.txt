ProteinName	2-acylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (EC 2.3.1.20) (EC 2.3.1.22) (Acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2) (MGAT2) (hMGAT2) (Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase candidate 5) (hDC5) (Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2-like protein 5) (Monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2)
GeneName	MOGAT2 DC5 DGAT2L5
Length	334
Function	Involved in glycerolipid synthesis and lipid metabolism (PubMed:12621063, PubMed:18768481, PubMed:27184406, PubMed:28420705). Catalyzes the formation of diacylglycerol, the precursor of triacylglycerol, by transferring the acyl chain of a fatty acyl-CoA to a monoacylglycerol (PubMed:12621063, PubMed:27184406). Plays a central role in absorption of dietary fat in the small intestine by catalyzing the resynthesis of triacylglycerol in enterocytes (By similarity). Has a preference toward monoacylglycerols containing unsaturated fatty acids in an order of C18:3 > C18:2 > C18:1 > C18:0 at sn-2 (PubMed:12621063). Able to use 1-monoalkylglycerol (1-MAkG, 1-O-alkylglycerol) as an acyl acceptor for the synthesis of monoalkyl-monoacylglycerol (MAMAG, 1-O-alkyl-3-acylglycerol or 1-O-alkyl-2-acylglycerol) and subsequently, with lower efficiency, may add another acyl chain producing monoalkyl-diacylglycerol (MADAG, 1-O-alkyl-2,3-diacylglycerol) (PubMed:28420705). Possesses weak but significant activity with diacylglycerol as substrate, producing triacylglycerol (triacyl-sn-glycerol) (PubMed:18768481).
