EntryName	CLC4E_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-type lectin domain family 4 member E (C-type lectin superfamily member 9) (Macrophage-inducible C-type lectin) (MINCLE)
GeneName	CLEC4E CLECSF9 MINCLE UNQ218/PRO244
Length	219
Function	Calcium-dependent lectin that acts as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) of the innate immune system: recognizes damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of abnormal self and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of bacteria and fungi (PubMed:18509109, PubMed:23602766). The PAMPs notably include mycobacterial trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM), a cell wall glycolipid with potent adjuvant immunomodulatory functions (PubMed:23602766, PubMed:24101491). Interacts with signaling adapter Fc receptor gamma chain/FCER1G to form a functional complex in myeloid cells (By similarity). Binding of mycobacterial trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM) to this receptor complex leads to phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of FCER1G, triggering activation of SYK, CARD9 and NF-kappa-B, consequently driving maturation of antigen-presenting cells and shaping antigen-specific priming of T-cells toward effector T-helper 1 and T-helper 17 cell subtypes (By similarity). Also recognizes alpha-mannose residues on pathogenic fungi of the genus Malassezia and mediates macrophage activation (By similarity). Through recognition of DAMPs released upon nonhomeostatic cell death, enables immune sensing of damaged self and promotes inflammatory cell infiltration into the damaged tissue (By similarity).
