UniprotID	Q9HC52
Accession	Q9HC52;Q96H39;Q9NR07
EntryName	CBX8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chromobox protein homolog 8 (Polycomb 3 homolog) (Pc3) (hPc3) (Rectachrome 1)
GeneName	CBX8 PC3 RC1
Length	389
Function	Component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones; it mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119', rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility.
