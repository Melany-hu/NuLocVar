UniprotID	Q8TAE7
Accession	Q8TAE7;Q53SC1
EntryName	KCNG3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Voltage-gated potassium channel regulatory subunit KCNG3 (Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily G member 3) (Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv10.1) (Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv6.3)
GeneName	KCNG3
Length	436
Function	Regulatory subunit of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel which, when coassembled with KCNB1, modulates the kinetics parameters of the heterotetrameric channel namely the inactivation and deactivation rate (PubMed:11852086, PubMed:12060745, PubMed:19074135). Potassium channel subunit that does not form functional channels by itself (PubMed:11852086, PubMed:12060745). Reduces the deactivation rate (PubMed:11852086). Moderately accelerates activation (PubMed:12060745).
