GeneName	AKR1C1 DDH DDH1
Length	323
Function	Cytosolic aldo-keto reductase that catalyzes the NADH and NADPH-dependent reduction of ketosteroids to hydroxysteroids (PubMed:19218247). Most probably acts as a reductase in vivo since the oxidase activity measured in vitro is inhibited by physiological concentrations of NADPH (PubMed:14672942). Displays a broad positional specificity acting on positions 3, 17 and 20 of steroids and regulates the metabolism of hormones like estrogens and androgens (PubMed:10998348). May also reduce conjugated steroids such as 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone sulfate (PubMed:19218247). Displays affinity for bile acids (PubMed:8486699).
