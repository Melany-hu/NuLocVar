ProteinName	Glycerophosphocholine cholinephosphodiesterase ENPP6 (GPC-Cpde) (EC 3.1.4.-) (EC 3.1.4.38) (Choline-specific glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase) (Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 6) (E-NPP 6) (NPP-6)
GeneName	ENPP6 UNQ1889/PRO4334
Length	440
Function	Choline-specific glycerophosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and contributes to supplying choline to the cells (PubMed:15788404). Has a preference for LPC with short (12:0 and 14:0) or polyunsaturated (18:2 and 20:4) fatty acids. In vitro, hydrolyzes only choline-containing lysophospholipids, such as sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), platelet-activating factor (PAF) and lysoPAF, but not other lysophospholipids (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
