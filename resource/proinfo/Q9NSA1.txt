UniprotID	Q9NSA1
Accession	Q9NSA1;Q8N683
EntryName	FGF21_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21)
GeneName	FGF21 UNQ3115/PRO10196
Length	209
Function	Stimulates glucose uptake in differentiated adipocytes via the induction of glucose transporter SLC2A1/GLUT1 expression (but not SLC2A4/GLUT4 expression). Activity requires the presence of KLB. Regulates systemic glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
