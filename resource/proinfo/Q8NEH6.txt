UniprotID	Q8NEH6
Accession	Q8NEH6;Q8IYT6;Q9NUP4
EntryName	MNS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Meiosis-specific nuclear structural protein 1
GeneName	MNS1
Length	495
Function	Microtubule inner protein (MIP) part of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in cilia axoneme, which is required for motile cilia beating (PubMed:36191189). May play a role in the control of meiotic division and germ cell differentiation through regulation of pairing and recombination during meiosis. Required for sperm flagella assembly (By similarity). May play a role in the assembly and function of the outer dynein arm-docking complex (ODA-DC). ODA-DC mediates outer dynein arms (ODA) binding onto the axonemal doublet microtubules (PubMed:30148830).
