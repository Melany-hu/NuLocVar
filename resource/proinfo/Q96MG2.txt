UniprotID	Q96MG2
Accession	Q96MG2
EntryName	JSPR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (Junctional-face membrane protein of 45 kDa homolog) (JP-45)
GeneName	JSRP1 JP45
Length	331
Function	Involved in skeletal muscle excitation/contraction coupling (EC), probably acting as a regulator of the voltage-sensitive calcium channel CACNA1S. EC is a physiological process whereby an electrical signal (depolarization of the plasma membrane) is converted into a chemical signal, a calcium gradient, by the opening of ryanodine receptor calcium release channels. May regulate CACNA1S membrane targeting and activity.
Subcellular Location	Sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
