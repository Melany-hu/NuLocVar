UniprotID	Q96NK8
Accession	Q96NK8;Q548T9;Q9H3H6
EntryName	NDF6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neurogenic differentiation factor 6 (NeuroD6) (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 2) (bHLHa2) (Protein atonal homolog 2)
GeneName	NEUROD6 ATOH2 BHLHA2 My051
Length	337
Function	Activates E box-dependent transcription in collaboration with TCF3/E47. May be a trans-acting factor involved in the development and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system. Transactivates the promoter of its own gene (By similarity).
