UniprotID	Q9UL25
Accession	Q9UL25;Q14466;Q569H3
EntryName	RAB21_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-21
GeneName	RAB21 KIAA0118
Length	225
Function	Small GTPase involved in membrane trafficking control (PubMed:18804435, PubMed:25648148). During the mitosis of adherent cells, controls the endosomal trafficking of integrins which is required for the successful completion of cytokinesis (PubMed:18804435). Regulates integrin internalization and recycling, but does not influence the traffic of endosomally translocated receptors in general (By similarity). As a result, may regulate cell adhesion and migration (By similarity). Involved in neurite growth (By similarity). Following SBF2/MTMT13-mediated activation in response to starvation-induced autophagy, binds to and regulates SNARE protein VAMP8 endolysosomal transport required for SNARE-mediated autophagosome-lysosome fusion (PubMed:25648148). Modulates protein levels of the cargo receptors TMED2 and TMED10, and required for appropriate Golgi localization of TMED10 (PubMed:31455601).
