EntryName	NFYC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear transcription factor Y subunit gamma (CAAT box DNA-binding protein subunit C) (Nuclear transcription factor Y subunit C) (NF-YC) (Transactivator HSM-1/2)
GeneName	NFYC
Length	458
Function	Component of the sequence-specific heterotrimeric transcription factor (NF-Y) which specifically recognizes a 5'-CCAAT-3' box motif found in the promoters of its target genes. NF-Y can function as both an activator and a repressor, depending on its interacting cofactors.
