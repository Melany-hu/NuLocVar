EntryName	MEMO1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein MEMO1 (C21orf19-like protein) (Hepatitis C virus NS5A-transactivated protein 7) (HCV NS5A-transactivated protein 7) (Mediator of ErbB2-driven cell motility 1) (Mediator of cell motility 1) (Memo-1)
GeneName	MEMO1 C2orf4 MEMO NS5ATP7 CGI-27
Length	297
Function	May control cell migration by relaying extracellular chemotactic signals to the microtubule cytoskeleton. Mediator of ERBB2 signaling. The MEMO1-RHOA-DIAPH1 signaling pathway plays an important role in ERBB2-dependent stabilization of microtubules at the cell cortex. It controls the localization of APC and CLASP2 to the cell membrane, via the regulation of GSK3B activity. In turn, membrane-bound APC allows the localization of the MACF1 to the cell membrane, which is required for microtubule capture and stabilization. Is required for breast carcinoma cell migration.
