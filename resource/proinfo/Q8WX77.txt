UniprotID	Q8WX77
Accession	Q8WX77
EntryName	IBPL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-like 1 (IGFBP-related protein 10) (Insulin-like growth factor-binding-related protein 4) (IGFBP-rP4)
GeneName	IGFBPL1 IGFBPRP4
Length	278
Function	IGF-binding proteins prolong the half-life of IGFs and have been shown to either inhibit or stimulate the growth promoting effects of the IGFs in cell culture. They alter the interaction of IGFs with their cell surface receptors (By similarity). May be a putative tumor suppressor protein.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
