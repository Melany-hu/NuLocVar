UniprotID	P62834
Accession	P62834;P10113
EntryName	RAP1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rap-1A (EC 3.6.5.2) (C21KG) (G-22K) (GTP-binding protein smg p21A) (Ras-related protein Krev-1)
GeneName	RAP1A KREV1
Length	184
Function	Counteracts the mitogenic function of Ras, at least partly because it can interact with Ras GAPs and RAF in a competitive manner. Together with ITGB1BP1, regulates KRIT1 localization to microtubules and membranes (PubMed:17916086). Plays a role in nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth. Plays a role in the regulation of embryonic blood vessel formation. Involved in the establishment of basal endothelial barrier function. Facilitates the progressive accumulation of CDH1 at mature desmosome junctions via cAMP-dependent signaling and its interaction with PKP3 (PubMed:25208567). May be involved in the regulation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR expression at endothelial cell-cell junctions.
