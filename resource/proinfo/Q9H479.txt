UniprotID	Q9H479
Accession	Q9H479
EntryName	FN3K_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fructosamine-3-kinase (EC 2.7.1.171) (Protein-psicosamine 3-kinase FN3K) (Protein-ribulosamine 3-kinase FN3K) (EC 2.7.1.172)
GeneName	FN3K
Length	309
Function	Fructosamine-3-kinase involved in protein deglycation by mediating phosphorylation of fructoselysine residues on glycated proteins, to generate fructoselysine-3 phosphate (PubMed:11016445, PubMed:11522682, PubMed:11975663). Fructoselysine-3 phosphate adducts are unstable and decompose under physiological conditions (PubMed:11522682, PubMed:11975663). Involved in intracellular deglycation in erythrocytes (PubMed:11975663). Involved in the response to oxidative stress by mediating deglycation of NFE2L2/NRF2, glycation impairing NFE2L2/NRF2 function (By similarity). Also able to phosphorylate psicosamines and ribulosamines (PubMed:14633848).
