UniprotID	O14521
Accession	O14521;A6ND90;B3KQQ8;E9PIC0;E9PIG3;E9PQI9;Q53XW5;Q6IRW2
EntryName	DHSD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Succinate dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] cytochrome b small subunit, mitochondrial (CybS) (CII-4) (Malate dehydrogenase [quinone] cytochrome b small subunit) (QPs3) (Succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit D) (Succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase cytochrome b small subunit) (Succinate-ubiquinone reductase membrane anchor subunit)
GeneName	SDHD SDH4
Length	159
Function	Membrane-anchoring subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) that is involved in complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and is responsible for transferring electrons from succinate to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) (PubMed:10482792, PubMed:9533030). SDH also oxidizes malate to the non-canonical enol form of oxaloacetate, enol-oxaloacetate (By similarity). Enol-oxaloacetate, which is a potent inhibitor of the succinate dehydrogenase activity, is further isomerized into keto-oxaloacetate (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
