UniprotID	P49798
Accession	P49798;A7XA56;A7XA58;A7XA59;A7YVV7;B1APZ3
EntryName	RGS4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGP4) (RGS4)
GeneName	RGS4
Length	205
Function	Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form. Activity on G(z)-alpha is inhibited by phosphorylation of the G-protein. Activity on G(z)-alpha and G(i)-alpha-1 is inhibited by palmitoylation of the G-protein.
