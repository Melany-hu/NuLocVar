UniprotID	O15105
Accession	O15105;B7Z773;K7EQ10;O14740;Q6DK23
EntryName	SMAD7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7 (MAD homolog 7) (Mothers against DPP homolog 7) (Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 8) (MAD homolog 8) (Mothers against DPP homolog 8) (SMAD family member 7) (SMAD 7) (Smad7) (hSMAD7)
GeneName	SMAD7 MADH7 MADH8
Length	426
Function	Antagonist of signaling by TGF-beta (transforming growth factor) type 1 receptor superfamily members; has been shown to inhibit TGF-beta (Transforming growth factor) and activin signaling by associating with their receptors thus preventing SMAD2 access (PubMed:21791611). Functions as an adapter to recruit SMURF2 to the TGF-beta receptor complex. Also acts by recruiting the PPP1R15A-PP1 complex to TGFBR1, which promotes its dephosphorylation. Positively regulates PDPK1 kinase activity by stimulating its dissociation from the 14-3-3 protein YWHAQ which acts as a negative regulator.
