UniprotID	Q8IUC0
Accession	Q8IUC0;Q14D20;Q3LI79
EntryName	KR131_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 13-1 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 13.1)
GeneName	KRTAP13-1 KAP13.1 KRTAP13.1
Length	172
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
