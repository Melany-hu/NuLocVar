UniprotID	Q495C1
Accession	Q495C1;C9J8N0;Q495C0;Q86W82;Q8IY99;Q8N8U7
EntryName	RN212_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable E3 SUMO-protein ligase RNF212 (EC 2.3.2.-) (Probable E3 SUMO-protein transferase RNF212) (RING finger protein 212)
GeneName	RNF212
Length	297
Function	SUMO E3 ligase that acts as a regulator of crossing-over during meiosis: required to couple chromosome synapsis to the formation of crossover-specific recombination complexes. Localizes to recombination sites and stabilizes meiosis-specific recombination factors, such as MutS-gamma complex proteins (MSH4 and MSH5) and TEX11. May mediate sumoylation of target proteins MSH4 and/or MSH5, leading to enhance their binding to recombination sites. Acts as a limiting factor for crossover designation and/or reinforcement and plays an antagonist role with CCNB1IP1/HEI10 in the regulation of meiotic recombination (By similarity).
