EntryName	ASIC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1) (Amiloride-sensitive cation channel 2, neuronal) (Brain sodium channel 2)
GeneName	ASIC1 ACCN2 BNAC2
Length	528
Function	Forms voltage-independent, pH-gated trimeric sodium channels that act as postsynaptic excitatory receptors in the nervous system, playing a crucial role in regulating synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (PubMed:21036899, PubMed:32915133, PubMed:34319232). Upon extracellular pH drop this channel elicits transient, fast activating, and completely desensitizing inward currents (PubMed:21036899). Displays high selectivity for sodium ions but can also permit the permeation of other cations (PubMed:21036899). Regulates more or less directly intracellular calcium concentration and CaMKII phosphorylation, and thereby the density of dendritic spines. Modulates neuronal activity in the circuits underlying innate fear (By similarity).
