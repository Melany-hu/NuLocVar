EntryName	ASB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 3 (ASB-3)
GeneName	ASB3
Length	518
Function	Probable substrate-recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin-Cullin-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Recognizes TNFRSF1B (PubMed:15899873). Plays a role in the down-regulation of antiviral innate immunity by targeting MAVS for ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation (PubMed:39266719). Also destabilizes TRAF6 by enhancing its 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:39162488).
