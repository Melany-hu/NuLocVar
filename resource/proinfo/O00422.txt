UniprotID	O00422
Accession	O00422;B2R494;Q2TTR4;Q6IAW9;Q8N606;Q9UF14;X6RAL5
EntryName	SAP18_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone deacetylase complex subunit SAP18 (18 kDa Sin3-associated polypeptide) (2HOR0202) (Cell growth-inhibiting gene 38 protein) (Sin3-associated polypeptide p18)
GeneName	SAP18 GIG38
Length	153
Function	Component of the SIN3-repressing complex. Enhances the ability of SIN3-HDAC1-mediated transcriptional repression. When tethered to the promoter, it can direct the formation of a repressive complex to core histone proteins. Auxiliary component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junction on mRNAs. The EJC is a dynamic structure consisting of core proteins and several peripheral nuclear and cytoplasmic associated factors that join the complex only transiently either during EJC assembly or during subsequent mRNA metabolism. Component of the ASAP and PSAP complexes which bind RNA in a sequence-independent manner and are proposed to be recruited to the EJC prior to or during the splicing process and to regulate specific excision of introns in specific transcription subsets. The ASAP complex can inhibit mRNA processing during in vitro splicing reactions. The ASAP complex promotes apoptosis and is disassembled after induction of apoptosis. Involved in the splicing modulation of BCL2L1/Bcl-X (and probably other apoptotic genes); specifically inhibits the formation of proapoptotic isoforms such as Bcl-X(S); the activity is different from the established EJC assembly and function.
