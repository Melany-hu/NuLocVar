ProteinName	Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK 1) (SPK 1) (EC 2.7.1.91) (Acetyltransferase SPHK1) (EC 2.3.1.-)
GeneName	SPHK1 SK1 SPHK SPK
Length	384
Function	Catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to form sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP), a lipid mediator with both intra- and extracellular functions. Also acts on D-erythro-sphingosine and to a lesser extent sphinganine, but not other lipids, such as D,L-threo-dihydrosphingosine, N,N-dimethylsphingosine, diacylglycerol, ceramide, or phosphatidylinositol (PubMed:11923095, PubMed:20577214, PubMed:23602659, PubMed:24929359, PubMed:29662056). In contrast to proapoptotic SPHK2, has a negative effect on intracellular ceramide levels, enhances cell growth and inhibits apoptosis (PubMed:16118219). Involved in the regulation of inflammatory response and neuroinflammation. Via the product sphingosine 1-phosphate, stimulates TRAF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, and promotes activation of NF-kappa-B in response to TNF signaling leading to IL17 secretion (PubMed:20577214). In response to TNF and in parallel to NF-kappa-B activation, negatively regulates RANTES induction through p38 MAPK signaling pathway (PubMed:23935096). Involved in endocytic membrane trafficking induced by sphingosine, recruited to dilate endosomes, also plays a role on later stages of endosomal maturation and membrane fusion independently of its kinase activity (PubMed:24929359, PubMed:28049734). In Purkinje cells, seems to be also involved in the regulation of autophagosome-lysosome fusion upon VEGFA (PubMed:25417698).
