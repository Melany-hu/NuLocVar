UniprotID	Q9P0M4
Accession	Q9P0M4;Q3MIG8;Q9HC75
EntryName	IL17C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-17C (IL-17C) (Cytokine CX2)
GeneName	IL17C UNQ561/PRO1122
Length	197
Function	Cytokine that plays a crucial role in innate immunity of the epithelium, including to intestinal bacterial pathogens, in an autocrine manner. Stimulates the production of antibacterial peptides and pro-inflammatory molecules for host defense by signaling through the NF-kappa-B and MAPK pathways. Acts synergically with IL22 in inducing the expression of antibacterial peptides, including S100A8, S100A9, REG3A and REG3G. Synergy is also observed with TNF and IL1B in inducing DEFB2 from keratinocytes. Depending on the type of insult, may have both protective and pathogenic properties, either by maintaining epithelial homeostasis after an inflammatory challenge or by promoting inflammatory phenotype. Enhanced IL17C/IL17RE signaling may also lead to greater susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.
