UniprotID	Q9BY32
Accession	Q9BY32;A2A2N2;A4UIM5;B2BCH7;O14878;Q5JWH4;Q9BYN1;Q9BYX0;Q9H3H8
EntryName	ITPA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase) (Inosine triphosphatase) (EC 3.6.1.9) (Non-canonical purine NTP pyrophosphatase) (Non-standard purine NTP pyrophosphatase) (Nucleoside-triphosphate diphosphatase) (Nucleoside-triphosphate pyrophosphatase) (NTPase) (Putative oncogene protein hlc14-06-p)
GeneName	ITPA C20orf37 My049 OK/SW-cl.9
Length	194
Function	Pyrophosphatase that hydrolyzes the non-canonical purine nucleotides inosine triphosphate (ITP), deoxyinosine triphosphate (dITP) as well as 2'-deoxy-N-6-hydroxylaminopurine triphosphate (dHAPTP) and xanthosine 5'-triphosphate (XTP) to their respective monophosphate derivatives. The enzyme does not distinguish between the deoxy- and ribose forms. Probably excludes non-canonical purines from RNA and DNA precursor pools, thus preventing their incorporation into RNA and DNA and avoiding chromosomal lesions.
