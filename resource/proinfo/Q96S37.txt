EntryName	S22AC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 22 member 12 (Organic anion transporter 4-like protein) (Renal-specific transporter) (RST) (Urate anion exchanger 1) (URAT1) (Urate:anion antiporter SLC22A12)
GeneName	SLC22A12 OATL4 URAT1 UNQ6453/PRO34004
Length	553
Function	Electroneutral antiporter that translocates urate across the apical membrane of proximal tubular cells in exchange for monovalent organic or inorganic anions (PubMed:12024214, PubMed:22194875, PubMed:35144162, PubMed:35462902). Involved in renal reabsorption of urate and helps maintaining blood levels of uric acid (PubMed:12024214, PubMed:22194875). Mediates urate uptake by an exchange with organic anions such as (S)-lactate and nicotinate, and inorganic anion Cl(-) (PubMed:12024214). Other inorganic anions such as Br(-), I(-) and NO3(-) may also act as counteranions that exchange for urate (PubMed:12024214). Also mediates orotate tubular uptake coupled with nicotinate efflux and to a lesser extent with lactate efflux, therefore displaying a potential role in orotate renal reabsorption (PubMed:21350910). Orotate transport is Cl(-)-dependent (PubMed:21350910).
