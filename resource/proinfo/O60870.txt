UniprotID	O60870
Accession	O60870;B4DX32
EntryName	KIN17_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA/RNA-binding protein KIN17 (Binding to curved DNA) (KIN, antigenic determinant of recA protein homolog)
GeneName	KIN BTCD KIN17
Length	393
Function	Involved in DNA replication and the cellular response to DNA damage. May participate in DNA replication factories and create a bridge between DNA replication and repair mediated by high molecular weight complexes. May play a role in illegitimate recombination and regulation of gene expression. May participate in mRNA processing. Binds, in vitro, to double-stranded DNA. Also shown to bind preferentially to curved DNA in vitro and in vivo (By similarity). Binds via its C-terminal domain to RNA in vitro.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm
