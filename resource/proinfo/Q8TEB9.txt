UniprotID	Q8TEB9
Accession	Q8TEB9;Q495B9;Q53S43;Q5EBM8;Q6P5V8;Q8IV60;Q9H057
EntryName	RHBL4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rhomboid-related protein 4 (RRP4) (EC 3.4.21.105) (Rhomboid domain-containing protein 1) (Rhomboid-like protein 4)
GeneName	RHBDD1 RHBDL4 HSD-50 HSD50
Length	315
Function	Intramembrane-cleaving serine protease that cleaves single transmembrane or multi-pass membrane proteins in the hydrophobic plane of the membrane, luminal loops and juxtamembrane regions. Involved in regulated intramembrane proteolysis and the subsequent release of functional polypeptides from their membrane anchors. Functional component of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) for misfolded membrane proteins. Required for the degradation process of some specific misfolded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal proteins. Participates in the transfer of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol, where they are destroyed by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. Functions in BIK, MPZ, PKD1, PTCRA, RHO, STEAP3 and TRAC processing. Involved in the regulation of exosomal secretion; inhibits the TSAP6-mediated secretion pathway. Involved in the regulation of apoptosis; modulates BIK-mediated apoptotic activity. Also plays a role in the regulation of spermatogenesis; inhibits apoptotic activity in spermatogonia.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Mitochondrion membrane
