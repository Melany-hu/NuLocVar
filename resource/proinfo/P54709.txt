UniprotID	P54709
Accession	P54709;B7Z1N7
EntryName	AT1B3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-3 (Sodium/potassium-dependent ATPase subunit beta-3) (ATPB-3) (CD antigen CD298)
GeneName	ATP1B3
Length	279
Function	This is the non-catalytic component of the active enzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of Na(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane. The exact function of the beta-3 subunit is not known.
