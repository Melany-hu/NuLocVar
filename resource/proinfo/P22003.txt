EntryName	BMP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bone morphogenetic protein 5 (BMP-5)
GeneName	BMP5
Length	454
Function	Growth factor of the TGF-beta superfamily that plays essential roles in many developmental processes, including cartilage and bone formation or neurogenesis (PubMed:11580864, PubMed:29321139). Initiates the canonical BMP signaling cascade by associating with type I receptor BMPR1A and type II receptor BMPR2 (PubMed:11580864). In turn, BMPR1A propagates signal by phosphorylating SMAD1/5/8 that travel to the nucleus and act as activators and repressors of transcription of target genes (PubMed:11580864, PubMed:29321139). Can also signal through non-canonical pathway such as MAPK p38 signaling cascade to promote chondrogenic differentiation (PubMed:20402566). Promotes the expression of HAMP, this is repressed by its interaction with ERFE (PubMed:30097509).
