ProteinName	Tubulin beta-8 chain (Tubulin beta 8 class VIII)
GeneName	TUBB8
Length	444
Function	Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules, a cylinder consisting of laterally associated linear protofilaments composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers. Microtubules grow by the addition of GTP-tubulin dimers to the microtubule end, where a stabilizing cap forms. Below the cap, tubulin dimers are in GDP-bound state, owing to GTPase activity of alpha-tubulin. TUBB8 has a key role in meiotic spindle assembly and oocyte maturation (PubMed:26789871, PubMed:34509376).
