UniprotID	Q99615
Accession	Q99615;Q7Z784
EntryName	DNJC7_HUMAN
ProteinName	DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 7 (Tetratricopeptide repeat protein 2) (TPR repeat protein 2)
GeneName	DNAJC7 TPR2 TTC2
Length	494
Function	Acts as a co-chaperone regulating the molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP90 in folding of steroid receptors, such as the glucocorticoid receptor and the progesterone receptor. Proposed to act as a recycling chaperone by facilitating the return of chaperone substrates to early stages of chaperoning if further folding is required. In vitro, induces ATP-independent dissociation of HSP90 but not of HSP70 from the chaperone-substrate complexes. Recruits NR1I3 to the cytoplasm (By similarity).
