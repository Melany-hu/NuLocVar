EntryName	MMAD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cobalamin trafficking protein CblD (CblD) (Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type D protein, mitochondrial)
GeneName	MMADHC C2orf25 CL25022 HSPC161 My011
Length	296
Function	Involved in cobalamin metabolism and trafficking (PubMed:18385497, PubMed:23415655, PubMed:24722857, PubMed:26364851). Plays a role in regulating the biosynthesis and the proportion of two coenzymes, methylcob(III)alamin (MeCbl) and 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) (PubMed:18385497, PubMed:23415655, PubMed:24722857). Promotes oxidation of cob(II)alamin bound to MMACHC (PubMed:26364851). The processing of cobalamin in the cytosol occurs in a multiprotein complex composed of at least MMACHC, MMADHC, MTRR (methionine synthase reductase) and MTR (methionine synthase) which may contribute to shuttle safely and efficiently cobalamin towards MTR in order to produce methionine (PubMed:27771510).
