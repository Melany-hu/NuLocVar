UniprotID	O14798
Accession	O14798;O14755;Q08AS6;Q6FH98;Q6UXM5
EntryName	TR10C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10C (Antagonist decoy receptor for TRAIL/Apo-2L) (Decoy TRAIL receptor without death domain) (Decoy receptor 1) (DcR1) (Lymphocyte inhibitor of TRAIL) (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 3) (TRAIL receptor 3) (TRAIL-R3) (TRAIL receptor without an intracellular domain) (CD antigen CD263)
GeneName	TNFRSF10C DCR1 LIT TRAILR3 TRID UNQ321/PRO366
Length	259
Function	Receptor for the cytotoxic ligand TRAIL. Lacks a cytoplasmic death domain and hence is not capable of inducing apoptosis. May protect cells against TRAIL mediated apoptosis by competing with TRAIL-R1 and R2 for binding to the ligand.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
