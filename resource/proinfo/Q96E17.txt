UniprotID	Q96E17
Accession	Q96E17
EntryName	RAB3C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-3C (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB3C
Length	227
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
