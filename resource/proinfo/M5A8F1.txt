UniprotID	M5A8F1
Accession	M5A8F1
EntryName	SUPYN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Suppressyn (Endogenous retrovirus group 48 member 1) (NDUFV3 antisense RNA 1) (endogenous retrovirus group Fb member 1)
GeneName	ERVH48-1 C21orf105 HERV-Fb1 NDUFV3-AS1
Length	160
Function	May play a role in trophoblasts syncytialization, the spontaneous fusion of their plasma membranes, an essential process in placental development. May negatively regulate cell-cell fusion by interacting with SLC1A5, the probable receptor on the cell surface of the fusogenic syncytin-1/ERVW-1.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
