UniprotID	Q9NX40
Accession	Q9NX40;C9K030;G8JLN7;Q9BZE8
EntryName	OCAD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	OCIA domain-containing protein 1 (Ovarian cancer immunoreactive antigen domain containing 1) (Ovarian carcinoma immunoreactive antigen)
GeneName	OCIAD1 ASRIJ OCIA
Length	245
Function	Maintains stem cell potency (By similarity). Increases STAT3 phosphorylation and controls ERK phosphorylation (By similarity). May act as a scaffold, increasing STAT3 recruitment onto endosomes (By similarity). Involved in integrin-mediated cancer cell adhesion and colony formation in ovarian cancer (PubMed:20515946).
