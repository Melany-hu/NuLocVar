Function	Translation regulator forming a complex with DENR to promote translation reinitiation. Translation reinitiation is the process where the small ribosomal subunit remains attached to the mRNA following termination of translation of a regulatory upstream ORF (uORF), and resume scanning on the same mRNA molecule to initiate translation of a downstream ORF, usually the main ORF (mORF). The MCTS1/DENR complex is pivotal to two linked mechanisms essential for translation reinitiation. Firstly, the dissociation of deacylated tRNAs from post-termination 40S ribosomal complexes during ribosome recycling. Secondly, the recruitment in an EIF2-independent manner of aminoacylated initiator tRNA to P site of 40S ribosomes for a new round of translation (PubMed:16982740, PubMed:20713520, PubMed:37875108). This regulatory mechanism governs the translation of more than 150 genes which translation reinitiation is MCTS1/DENR complex-dependent (PubMed:16982740, PubMed:20713520, PubMed:37875108). Consequently, modulates various unrelated biological processes including cell cycle regulation and DNA damage signaling and repair (PubMed:10440924, PubMed:11709712, PubMed:12637315, PubMed:15897892, PubMed:16322206, PubMed:17016429, PubMed:17416211, PubMed:9766643). Notably, it positively regulates interferon gamma immunity to mycobacteria by enhancing the translation of JAK2 (PubMed:37875108).
