UniprotID	P22492
Accession	P22492;Q6ISI1;Q8IUE8
EntryName	H1T_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H1t (Testicular H1 histone)
GeneName	H1-6 H1FT H1T HIST1H1T
Length	207
Function	Testis-specific histone H1 that forms less compacted chromatin compared to other H1 histone subtypes (PubMed:26757249). Formation of more relaxed chromatin may be required to promote chromatin architecture required for proper chromosome regulation during meiosis, such as homologous recombination (PubMed:26757249). Histones H1 act as linkers that bind to nucleosomes and compact polynucleosomes into a higher-order chromatin configuration (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
