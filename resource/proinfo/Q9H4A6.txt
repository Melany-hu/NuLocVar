UniprotID	Q9H4A6
Accession	Q9H4A6;Q9UIW5
EntryName	GOLP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (Coat protein GPP34) (Mitochondrial DNA absence factor) (MIDAS)
GeneName	GOLPH3 GPP34
Length	298
Function	Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-binding protein that links Golgi membranes to the cytoskeleton and may participate in the tensile force required for vesicle budding from the Golgi. Thereby, may play a role in Golgi membrane trafficking and could indirectly give its flattened shape to the Golgi apparatus. May also bind to the coatomer to regulate Golgi membrane trafficking. May play a role in anterograde transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane and regulate secretion. Has also been involved in the control of the localization of Golgi enzymes through interaction with their cytoplasmic part. May play an indirect role in cell migration. Has also been involved in the modulation of mTOR signaling. May also be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial lipids biosynthesis.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack membrane; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane; Mitochondrion intermembrane space; Cell membrane; Endosome
