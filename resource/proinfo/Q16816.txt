UniprotID	Q16816
Accession	Q16816;B7Z1D0;F5H2S1;Q75LP5
EntryName	PHKG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphorylase b kinase gamma catalytic chain, skeletal muscle/heart isoform (PHK-gamma-M) (EC 2.7.11.19) (Phosphorylase kinase subunit gamma-1) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase PHKG1) (EC 2.7.11.1, EC 2.7.11.26)
GeneName	PHKG1 PHKG
Length	387
Function	Catalytic subunit of the phosphorylase b kinase (PHK), which mediates the neural and hormonal regulation of glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis) by phosphorylating and thereby activating glycogen phosphorylase. In vitro, phosphorylates PYGM, TNNI3, MAPT/TAU, GAP43 and NRGN/RC3 (By similarity).
