Accession	P37840;A8K2A4;Q13701;Q4JHI3;Q6IAU6
EntryName	SYUA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-synuclein (Non-A beta component of AD amyloid) (Non-A4 component of amyloid precursor) (NACP)
GeneName	SNCA NACP PARK1
Length	140
Function	Neuronal protein that plays several roles in synaptic activity such as regulation of synaptic vesicle trafficking and subsequent neurotransmitter release (PubMed:20798282, PubMed:26442590, PubMed:28288128, PubMed:30404828). Participates as a monomer in synaptic vesicle exocytosis by enhancing vesicle priming, fusion and dilation of exocytotic fusion pores (PubMed:28288128, PubMed:30404828). Mechanistically, acts by increasing local Ca(2+) release from microdomains which is essential for the enhancement of ATP-induced exocytosis (PubMed:30404828). Also acts as a molecular chaperone in its multimeric membrane-bound state, assisting in the folding of synaptic fusion components called SNAREs (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein REceptors) at presynaptic plasma membrane in conjunction with cysteine string protein-alpha/DNAJC5 (PubMed:20798282). This chaperone activity is important to sustain normal SNARE-complex assembly during aging (PubMed:20798282). Also plays a role in the regulation of the dopamine neurotransmission by associating with the dopamine transporter (DAT1) and thereby modulating its activity (PubMed:26442590).
