EntryName	COT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	COUP transcription factor 2 (COUP-TF2) (Apolipoprotein A-I regulatory protein 1) (ARP-1) (COUP transcription factor II) (COUP-TF II) (Nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 2)
GeneName	NR2F2 ARP1 TFCOUP2
Length	414
Function	Ligand-activated transcription factor. Activated by high concentrations of 9-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans-retinoic acid, but not by dexamethasone, cortisol or progesterone (in vitro). Regulation of the apolipoprotein A-I gene transcription. Binds to DNA site A. May be required to establish ovary identity during early gonad development (PubMed:29478779).
