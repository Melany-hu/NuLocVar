Accession	Q96A54;B3KMB0;Q53HS7;Q53YY6;Q9Y360
EntryName	PAQR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adiponectin receptor protein 1 (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 1) (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member I)
GeneName	ADIPOR1 PAQR1 TESBP1A CGI-45
Length	375
Function	Receptor for ADIPOQ, an essential hormone secreted by adipocytes that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism (PubMed:12802337, PubMed:25855295). Required for normal glucose and fat homeostasis and for maintaining a normal body weight. ADIPOQ-binding activates a signaling cascade that leads to increased AMPK activity, and ultimately to increased fatty acid oxidation, increased glucose uptake and decreased gluconeogenesis. Has high affinity for globular adiponectin and low affinity for full-length adiponectin (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
