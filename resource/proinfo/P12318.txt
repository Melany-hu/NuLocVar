UniprotID	P12318
Accession	P12318;Q8WUN1;Q8WW64
EntryName	FCG2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Low affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor II-a (IgG Fc receptor II-a) (CDw32) (Fc-gamma RII-a) (Fc-gamma-RIIa) (FcRII-a) (CD antigen CD32)
GeneName	FCGR2A CD32 FCG2 FCGR2A1 IGFR2
Length	317
Function	Binds to the Fc region of immunoglobulins gamma. Low affinity receptor. By binding to IgG it initiates cellular responses against pathogens and soluble antigens. Promotes phagocytosis of opsonized antigens.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
