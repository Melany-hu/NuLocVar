UniprotID	P61968
Accession	P61968;D3DT23;O00158;O88894
EntryName	LMO4_HUMAN
ProteinName	LIM domain transcription factor LMO4 (Breast tumor autoantigen) (LIM domain only protein 4) (LMO-4)
GeneName	LMO4
Length	165
Function	Transcription cofactor. Plays a role in establishing motor neuron identity, in concert with MNX1, acting, at least in part, to disrupt LDB1-LHX3 complexes thereby negatively modulating interneuron genes in motor neurons.
