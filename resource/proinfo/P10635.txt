UniprotID	P10635
Accession	P10635;Q16752;Q2XND6;Q2XND7;Q2XNE0;Q6B012;Q6NXU8
EntryName	CP2D6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 2D6 (EC 1.14.14.-) (CYPIID6) (Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase) (Cytochrome P450-DB1) (Debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase)
GeneName	CYP2D6 CYP2DL1
Length	497
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of fatty acids, steroids and retinoids (PubMed:18698000, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997, PubMed:21289075, PubMed:21576599). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:18698000, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997, PubMed:21289075, PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Metabolizes endocannabinoid arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ethanolamide (20-HETE-EA) and 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ethanolamides (EpETrE-EAs), potentially modulating endocannabinoid system signaling (PubMed:18698000, PubMed:21289075). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes cholesterol toward 25-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological regulator of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:21576599). Catalyzes the oxidative transformations of all-trans retinol to all-trans retinal, a precursor for the active form all-trans-retinoic acid (PubMed:10681376). Also involved in the oxidative metabolism of drugs such as antiarrhythmics, adrenoceptor antagonists, and tricyclic antidepressants.
