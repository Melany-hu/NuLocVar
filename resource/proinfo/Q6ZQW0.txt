UniprotID	Q6ZQW0
Accession	Q6ZQW0;A4UD41;F5H5G0
EntryName	I23O2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (IDO-2) (EC 1.13.11.-) (Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-like protein 1) (Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase-like protein 1)
GeneName	IDO2 INDOL1
Length	407
Function	Catalyzes the first and rate limiting step of the catabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway (PubMed:17671174). Involved in immune regulation. May not play a significant role in tryptophan-related tumoral resistance (PubMed:25691885).
