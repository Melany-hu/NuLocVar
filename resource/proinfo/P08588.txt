ProteinName	Beta-1 adrenergic receptor (Beta-1 adrenoreceptor) (Beta-1 adrenoceptor)
GeneName	ADRB1 ADRB1R B1AR
Length	477
Function	Beta-adrenergic receptors mediate the catecholamine-induced activation of adenylate cyclase through the action of G proteins. This receptor binds epinephrine and norepinephrine with approximately equal affinity. Mediates Ras activation through G(s)-alpha- and cAMP-mediated signaling. Involved in the regulation of sleep/wake behaviors (PubMed:31473062).
