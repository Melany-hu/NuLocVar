EntryName	SNW1_HUMAN
ProteinName	SNW domain-containing protein 1 (Nuclear protein SkiP) (Nuclear receptor coactivator NCoA-62) (Ski-interacting protein)
GeneName	SNW1 SKIIP SKIP
Length	536
Function	Involved in pre-mRNA splicing as component of the spliceosome (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770). As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (Probable). Required for the specific splicing of CDKN1A pre-mRNA; the function probably involves the recruitment of U2AF2 to the mRNA. May recruit PPIL1 to the spliceosome. May be involved in cyclin-D1/CCND1 mRNA stability through the SNARP complex which associates with both the 3'end of the CCND1 gene and its mRNA. Involved in transcriptional regulation. Modulates TGF-beta-mediated transcription via association with SMAD proteins, MYOD1-mediated transcription via association with PABPN1, RB1-mediated transcriptional repression, and retinoid-X receptor (RXR)- and vitamin D receptor (VDR)-dependent gene transcription in a cell line-specific manner probably involving coactivators NCOA1 and GRIP1. Is involved in NOTCH1-mediated transcriptional activation. Binds to multimerized forms of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and is proposed to recruit transcriptional coactivators such as MAML1 to form an intermediate preactivation complex which associates with DNA-bound CBF-1/RBPJ to form a transcriptional activation complex by releasing SNW1 and redundant NOTCH1 NICD.
