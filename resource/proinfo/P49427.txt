UniprotID	P49427
Accession	P49427;A8K689
EntryName	UB2R1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 R1 (EC 2.3.2.23) ((E3-independent) E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme R1) (EC 2.3.2.24) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme R1) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-32 kDa complementing) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-CDC34) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase R1)
GeneName	CDC34 UBCH3 UBE2R1
Length	236
Function	E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that accepts ubiquitin from an E1 ubiquitin-activating protein, and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins by an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (PubMed:10329681, PubMed:17588522, PubMed:20061386, PubMed:38326650). In vitro catalyzes 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:22496338). Cooperates with the E2 UBCH5C and the SCF(FBXW11) E3 ligase complex for the polyubiquitination of NFKBIA leading to its subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:10329681, PubMed:10918611, PubMed:17698585). Performs ubiquitin chain elongation building ubiquitin chains from the UBE2D3-primed NFKBIA-linked ubiquitin. UBE2D3 acts as an initiator E2, priming the phosphorylated NFKBIA target at positions 'Lys-21' and/or 'Lys-22' with a monoubiquitin. Cooperates with the SCF(SKP2) E3 ligase complex to regulate cell proliferation through ubiquitination and degradation of MYBL2 and KIP1 (PubMed:10871850, PubMed:15652359, PubMed:19112177). Involved in ubiquitin conjugation and degradation of CREM isoform ICERIIgamma and ATF15 resulting in abrogation of ICERIIgamma- and ATF5-mediated repression of cAMP-induced transcription during both meiotic and mitotic cell cycles. Involved in the regulation of the cell cycle G2/M phase through its targeting of the WEE1 kinase for ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:19126550). Also involved in the degradation of beta-catenin (PubMed:12037680). Is target of human herpes virus 1 protein ICP0, leading to ICP0-dependent dynamic interaction with proteasomes (PubMed:11805320, PubMed:12060736).
