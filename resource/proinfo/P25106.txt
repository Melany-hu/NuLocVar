Accession	P25106;A8K6J4;Q53RV4;Q8NE10;Q92938;Q92986
EntryName	ACKR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Atypical chemokine receptor 3 (C-X-C chemokine receptor type 7) (CXC-R7) (CXCR-7) (Chemokine orphan receptor 1) (G-protein coupled receptor 159) (G-protein coupled receptor RDC1 homolog) (RDC-1)
GeneName	ACKR3 CMKOR1 CXCR7 GPR159 RDC1
Length	362
Function	Atypical chemokine receptor that controls chemokine levels and localization via high-affinity chemokine binding that is uncoupled from classic ligand-driven signal transduction cascades, resulting instead in chemokine sequestration, degradation, or transcytosis. Also known as interceptor (internalizing receptor) or chemokine-scavenging receptor or chemokine decoy receptor. Acts as a receptor for chemokines CXCL11 and CXCL12/SDF1 (PubMed:16107333, PubMed:19255243, PubMed:19380869, PubMed:20161793, PubMed:22300987). Chemokine binding does not activate G-protein-mediated signal transduction but instead induces beta-arrestin recruitment, leading to ligand internalization and activation of MAPK signaling pathway (PubMed:16940167, PubMed:18653785, PubMed:20018651). Required for regulation of CXCR4 protein levels in migrating interneurons, thereby adapting their chemokine responsiveness (PubMed:16940167, PubMed:18653785). In glioma cells, transduces signals via MEK/ERK pathway, mediating resistance to apoptosis. Promotes cell growth and survival (PubMed:16940167, PubMed:20388803). Not involved in cell migration, adhesion or proliferation of normal hematopoietic progenitors but activated by CXCL11 in malignant hemapoietic cells, leading to phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (MAPK3/MAPK1) and enhanced cell adhesion and migration (PubMed:17804806, PubMed:18653785, PubMed:19641136, PubMed:20887389). Plays a regulatory role in CXCR4-mediated activation of cell surface integrins by CXCL12 (PubMed:18653785). Required for heart valve development (PubMed:17804806). Regulates axon guidance in the oculomotor system through the regulation of CXCL12 levels (PubMed:31211835).
