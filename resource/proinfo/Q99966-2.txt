UniprotID	Q99966-2
Accession	Q99966;B5BU50;B5BUI2
EntryName	CITE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator 1 (Melanocyte-specific protein 1)
GeneName	CITED1 MSG1
Length	219
Function	Transcriptional coactivator of the p300/CBP-mediated transcription complex. Enhances SMAD-mediated transcription by strengthening the functional link between the DNA-binding SMAD transcription factors and the p300/CBP transcription coactivator complex. Stimulates estrogen-dependent transactivation activity mediated by estrogen receptors signaling; stabilizes the interaction of estrogen receptor ESR1 and histone acetyltransferase EP300. Positively regulates TGF-beta signaling through its association with the SMAD/p300/CBP-mediated transcriptional coactivator complex. Induces transcription from estrogen-responsive promoters and protection against cell death. Potentiates EGR2-mediated transcriptional activation activity from the ERBB2 promoter. Acts as an inhibitor of osteoblastic mineralization through a cAMP-dependent parathyroid hormone receptor signaling. May play a role in pigmentation of melanocytes. Associates with chromatin to the estrogen-responsive TGF-alpha promoter region in a estrogen-dependent manner.
