UniprotID	Q15464
Accession	Q15464;B9EGM0;D3DRQ5;Q504U5;Q5VUM8
EntryName	SHB_HUMAN
ProteinName	SH2 domain-containing adapter protein B
GeneName	SHB
Length	509
Function	Adapter protein which regulates several signal transduction cascades by linking activated receptors to downstream signaling components. May play a role in angiogenesis by regulating FGFR1, VEGFR2 and PDGFR signaling. May also play a role in T-cell antigen receptor/TCR signaling, interleukin-2 signaling, apoptosis and neuronal cells differentiation by mediating basic-FGF and NGF-induced signaling cascades. May also regulate IRS1 and IRS2 signaling in insulin-producing cells.
