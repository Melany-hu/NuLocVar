UniprotID	Q9BQD7
Accession	Q9BQD7;A2IDD4
EntryName	ANKMT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenine nucleotide translocase lysine N-methyltransferase (ANT-KMT) (EC 2.1.1.-)
GeneName	ANTKMT C16orf24 FAM173A RJD7
Length	235
Function	Mitochondrial protein-lysine N-methyltransferase that trimethylates adenine nucleotide translocases ANT2/SLC25A5 and ANT3/SLC25A6, thereby regulating mitochondrial respiration (PubMed:31213526). Probably also trimethylates ANT1/SLC25A4 (PubMed:31213526).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion membrane
