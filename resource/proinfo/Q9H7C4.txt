UniprotID	Q9H7C4
Accession	Q9H7C4;B4DNK8;B4DY58;C9IY41
EntryName	SYNCI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Syncoilin (Syncoilin intermediate filament 1) (Syncoilin-1)
GeneName	SYNC SYNC1
Length	482
Function	Atypical type III intermediate filament (IF) protein that may play a supportive role in the efficient coupling of mechanical stress between the myofibril and fiber exterior. May facilitate lateral force transmission during skeletal muscle contraction. Does not form homofilaments nor heterofilaments with other IF proteins.
