UniprotID	P40337
Accession	P40337;B2RE45;Q13599;Q6PDA9
EntryName	VHL_HUMAN
ProteinName	von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor (Protein G7) (pVHL)
GeneName	VHL
Length	213
Function	Involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitination complex (PubMed:10944113, PubMed:17981124, PubMed:19584355). Seems to act as a target recruitment subunit in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and recruits hydroxylated hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) under normoxic conditions (PubMed:10944113, PubMed:17981124). Involved in transcriptional repression through interaction with HIF1A, HIF1AN and histone deacetylases (PubMed:10944113, PubMed:17981124). Ubiquitinates, in an oxygen-responsive manner, ADRB2 (PubMed:19584355). Acts as a negative regulator of mTORC1 by promoting ubiquitination and degradation of RPTOR (PubMed:34290272).
