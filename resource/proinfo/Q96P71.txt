EntryName	NECA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding protein 3 (Amyloid-beta A4 protein-binding family A member 2-binding protein) (Nek2-interacting protein 1) (Neuronal calcium-binding protein 3) (X11L-binding protein 51)
GeneName	NECAB3 APBA2BP NIP1 SYTIP2 XB51
Length	396
Function	Inhibits the interaction of APBA2 with amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), and hence allows formation of amyloid-beta. May enhance the activity of HIF1A and thus promote glycolysis under normoxic conditions; the function requires its ABM domain and may implicate the stabilization of the interaction between HIF1AN and APBA3.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus
