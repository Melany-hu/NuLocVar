UniprotID	Q99819
Accession	Q99819;Q4TT69;Q96S29
EntryName	GDIR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 3 (Rho GDI 3) (Rho-GDI gamma)
GeneName	ARHGDIG
Length	225
Function	Inhibits GDP/GTP exchange reaction of RhoB. Interacts specifically with the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of post-translationally processed Rhob and Rhog proteins, both of which show a growth-regulated expression in mammalian cells. Stimulates the release of the GDP-bound but not the GTP-bound RhoB protein. Also inhibits the GDP/GTP exchange of RhoB but shows less ability to inhibit the dissociation of prebound GTP.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
