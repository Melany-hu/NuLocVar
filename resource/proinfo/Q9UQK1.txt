UniprotID	Q9UQK1
Accession	Q9UQK1;B2R7X0;O95686
EntryName	PPR3C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3C (Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 5) (PP1 subunit R5) (Protein targeting to glycogen) (PTG)
GeneName	PPP1R3C PPP1R5
Length	317
Function	Acts as a glycogen-targeting subunit for PP1 and regulates its activity. Activates glycogen synthase, reduces glycogen phosphorylase activity and limits glycogen breakdown. Dramatically increases basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis upon overexpression in a variety of cell types.
