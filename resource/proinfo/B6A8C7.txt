UniprotID	B6A8C7
Accession	B6A8C7;B4DWY4
EntryName	TARM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	T-cell-interacting, activating receptor on myeloid cells protein 1 (OSCAR-like transcript-2 protein) (OLT-2)
GeneName	TARM1
Length	271
Function	May act as receptor (By similarity). Negatively regulates TCR-mediated CD4(+) T cell proliferation and activation, possibly by binding an unknown ligand on the T cell surface (PubMed:26311901). Enhances Toll-like receptor-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages and neutrophils (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
