UniprotID	P21583
Accession	P21583;A0AV09;A8K2Q4;B7ZLM4;Q16487;Q68DZ2;Q7M4N8;Q9UQK7
EntryName	SCF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kit ligand (Mast cell growth factor) (MGF) (Stem cell factor) (SCF) (c-Kit ligand) [Cleaved into: Soluble KIT ligand (sKITLG)]
GeneName	KITLG MGF SCF
Length	273
Function	Ligand for the receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinase KIT. Plays an essential role in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation, hematopoiesis, stem cell maintenance, gametogenesis, mast cell development, migration and function, and in melanogenesis. KITLG/SCF binding can activate several signaling pathways. Promotes phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and subsequent activation of the kinase AKT1. KITLG/SCF and KIT also transmit signals via GRB2 and activation of RAS, RAF1 and the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and/or MAPK3/ERK1. KITLG/SCF and KIT promote activation of STAT family members STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5. KITLG/SCF and KIT promote activation of PLCG1, leading to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. KITLG/SCF acts synergistically with other cytokines, probably interleukins.
