UniprotID	Q15915
Accession	Q15915;Q2M3N1
EntryName	ZIC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein ZIC 1 (Zinc finger protein 201) (Zinc finger protein of the cerebellum 1)
GeneName	ZIC1 ZIC ZNF201
Length	447
Function	Acts as a transcriptional activator. Involved in neurogenesis. Plays important roles in the early stage of organogenesis of the CNS, as well as during dorsal spinal cord development and maturation of the cerebellum. Involved in the spatial distribution of mossy fiber (MF) neurons within the pontine gray nucleus (PGN). Plays a role in the regulation of MF axon pathway choice. Promotes MF migration towards ipsilaterally-located cerebellar territories. May have a role in shear flow mechanotransduction in osteocytes. Retains nuclear GLI1 and GLI3 in the cytoplasm. Binds to the minimal GLI-consensus sequence 5'-TGGGTGGTC-3' (By similarity).
