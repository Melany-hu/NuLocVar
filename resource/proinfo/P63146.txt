Accession	P63146;B2R503;D3DQA2;P23567;Q4PJ15;Q9D0J6
EntryName	UBE2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 B (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme B) (RAD6 homolog B) (HR6B) (hHR6B) (Ubiquitin carrier protein B) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-17 kDa) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase B)
GeneName	UBE2B RAD6B UBCH1
Length	152
Function	E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that accepts ubiquitin from the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 and transfers it to a E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (PubMed:16337599, PubMed:17108083, PubMed:17130289, PubMed:1717990, PubMed:20061386). In vitro catalyzes 'Lys-11'-, as well as 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:20061386). Together with the E3 enzyme BRE1 (RNF20 and/or RNF40), plays a role in transcription regulation by catalyzing the monoubiquitination of histone H2B at 'Lys-120' to form H2BK120ub1 (PubMed:16337599). H2BK120ub1 gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation, elongation by RNA polymerase II, telomeric silencing, and is also a prerequisite for H3K4me and H3K79me formation (PubMed:16337599). May play a role in DNA repair (PubMed:8062904). Associates to the E3 ligase RAD18 to form the UBE2B-RAD18 ubiquitin ligase complex involved in mono-ubiquitination of DNA-associated PCNA on 'Lys-164' (PubMed:17108083, PubMed:17130289). In association with the E3 enzyme UBR4, is involved in N-end rule-dependent protein degradation (PubMed:38182926). May be involved in neurite outgrowth (By similarity).
