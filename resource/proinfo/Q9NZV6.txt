UniprotID	Q9NZV6
Accession	Q9NZV6;Q96RX6;Q9BTV2;Q9P0B1
EntryName	MSRB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase B1 (MsrB1) (EC 1.8.4.12) (EC 1.8.4.14) (Selenoprotein X) (SelX)
GeneName	MSRB1 SEPX1 HSPC270
Length	116
Function	Methionine-sulfoxide reductase that specifically reduces methionine (R)-sulfoxide back to methionine. While in many cases, methionine oxidation is the result of random oxidation following oxidative stress, methionine oxidation is also a post-translational modification that takes place on specific residue. Acts as a regulator of actin assembly by reducing methionine (R)-sulfoxide mediated by MICALs (MICAL1, MICAL2 or MICAL3) on actin, thereby promoting filament repolymerization. Plays a role in innate immunity by reducing oxidized actin, leading to actin repolymerization in macrophages.
