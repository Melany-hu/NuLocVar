UniprotID	P82251
Accession	P82251;B2R9A6
EntryName	BAT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	b(0,+)-type amino acid transporter 1 (b(0,+)AT1) (Glycoprotein-associated amino acid transporter b0,+AT1) (Solute carrier family 7 member 9)
GeneName	SLC7A9 BAT1
Length	487
Function	Associates with SLC3A1 to form a functional transporter complex that mediates the electrogenic exchange between cationic amino acids and neutral amino acids, with a stoichiometry of 1:1 (PubMed:16825196, PubMed:32494597, PubMed:32817565, PubMed:8663357). Has system b(0,+)-like activity with high affinity for extracellular cationic amino acids and L-cystine and lower affinity for intracellular neutral amino acids (PubMed:16825196, PubMed:32494597, PubMed:8663357). Substrate exchange is driven by high concentration of intracellular neutral amino acids and the intracellular reduction of L-cystine to L-cysteine (PubMed:8663357). Required for reabsorption of L-cystine and dibasic amino acids across the brush border membrane in renal proximal tubules.
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane; Cell membrane
