UniprotID	O15263
Accession	O15263;Q52LC0
EntryName	DFB4A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Defensin beta 4A (Beta-defensin 2) (BD-2) (hBD-2) (Defensin, beta 2) (Skin-antimicrobial peptide 1) (SAP1)
GeneName	DEFB4A DEFB102 DEFB2 DEFB4; DEFB4B
Length	64
Function	Exhibits antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria, with highest activity against Gram-negative bacteria (PubMed:10837369, PubMed:9202117). Antimicrobial activity against P.aruginosa seems to be salt-sensitive and is reduced with high salt concentrations greater than 25 mM (PubMed:10837369). Also exhibits antimicrobial activity against the yeast C.albicans (PubMed:10837369, PubMed:30050988, PubMed:9202117). Permeabilizes C.albicans cell membranes via targeting plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), thereby leading to cell fragmentation and cell death (PubMed:30050988). Acts as a ligand for C-C chemokine receptor CCR6 (PubMed:10521347, PubMed:20068036). Binds to CCR6 and induces chemotactic activity of CCR6-expressing cells, such as immature dendritic cells and memory T cells (PubMed:10521347, PubMed:20068036).
