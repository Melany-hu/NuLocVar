EntryName	ZN830_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein 830 (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 16)
GeneName	ZNF830 CCDC16
Length	372
Function	May play a role in pre-mRNA splicing as component of the spliceosome (PubMed:25599396). Acts as an important regulator of the cell cycle that participates in the maintenance of genome integrity. During cell cycle progression in embryonic fibroblast, prevents replication fork collapse, double-strand break formation and cell cycle checkpoint activation. Controls mitotic cell cycle progression and cell survival in rapidly proliferating intestinal epithelium and embryonic stem cells. During the embryo preimplantation, controls different aspects of M phase. During early oocyte growth, plays a role in oocyte survival by preventing chromosomal breaks formation, activation of TP63 and reduction of transcription (By similarity).
