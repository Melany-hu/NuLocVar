Function	Filament-forming cytoskeletal GTPase. May play a role in cytokinesis (Potential). May play a role in the cytoarchitecture of neurons, including dendritic arborization and dendritic spines, and in GABAergic synaptic connectivity (By similarity). During Listeria monocytogenes infection, not required for the bacterial entry process, but restricts its efficacy.
