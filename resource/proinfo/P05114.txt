UniprotID	P05114
Accession	P05114;Q3KQR8
EntryName	HMGN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Non-histone chromosomal protein HMG-14 (High mobility group nucleosome-binding domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	HMGN1 HMG14
Length	100
Function	Binds to the inner side of the nucleosomal DNA thus altering the interaction between the DNA and the histone octamer. May be involved in the process which maintains transcribable genes in a unique chromatin conformation. Inhibits the phosphorylation of nucleosomal histones H3 and H2A by RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA3/RSK2 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm
