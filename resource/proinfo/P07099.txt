EntryName	HYEP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Epoxide hydrolase 1 (EC 3.3.2.9) (Epoxide hydratase) (Microsomal epoxide hydrolase) (mEH)
GeneName	EPHX1 EPHX EPOX
Length	455
Function	Biotransformation enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of arene and aliphatic epoxides to less reactive and more water soluble dihydrodiols by the trans addition of water (By similarity). Plays a role in the metabolism of endogenous lipids such as epoxide-containing fatty acids (PubMed:22798687). Metabolizes the abundant endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) to free arachidonic acid (AA) and glycerol (PubMed:24958911). Binds 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol (20(S)-OHC) (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Microsome membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
