UniprotID	Q6PEW1
Accession	Q6PEW1;B3KV48;Q6PID5;Q8N1C1
EntryName	ZCH12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger CCHC domain-containing protein 12 (Smad-interacting zinc finger protein 1)
GeneName	ZCCHC12 SIZN1
Length	402
Function	Transcriptional coactivator in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-signaling pathway. It positively modulates BMP signaling by interacting with SMAD1 and associating with CBP in the transcription complex. It contributes to the BMP-induced enhancement of cholinergic-neuron-specific gene expression (By similarity).
