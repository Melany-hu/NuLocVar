UniprotID	P05423
Accession	P05423;Q6FI28;Q9BPV7;Q9BPZ1;Q9BXB3
EntryName	RPC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC4 (RNA polymerase III subunit C4) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit D) (Protein BN51) (RNA polymerase III 47 kDa subunit) (RPC53 homolog)
GeneName	POLR3D BN51 BN51T
Length	398
Function	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates (PubMed:12391170, PubMed:20413673, PubMed:33558764, PubMed:34675218, PubMed:35637192). Specific peripheric component of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) which synthesizes small non-coding RNAs including 5S rRNA, snRNAs, tRNAs and miRNAs from at least 500 distinct genomic loci. Assembles with POLR3E/RPC5 forming a subcomplex that binds the Pol III core. Enables recruitment of Pol III at transcription initiation site and drives transcription initiation from both type 2 and type 3 DNA promoters. Required for efficient transcription termination and reinitiation (By similarity) (PubMed:12391170, PubMed:20413673, PubMed:35637192). Pol III plays a key role in sensing and limiting infection by intracellular bacteria and DNA viruses. Acts as nuclear and cytosolic DNA sensor involved in innate immune response. Can sense non-self dsDNA that serves as template for transcription into dsRNA. The non-self RNA polymerase III transcripts, such as Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNAs (EBERs) induce type I interferon and NF-kappa-B through the RIG-I pathway (PubMed:19609254, PubMed:19631370).
