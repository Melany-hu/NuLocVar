UniprotID	P62875
Accession	P62875;P52436;Q6FHX3
EntryName	RPAB5_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerases I, II, and III subunit RPABC5 (RNA polymerases I, II, and III subunit ABC5) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit L) (RNA polymerase II 7.6 kDa subunit) (RPB7.6) (RPB10 homolog)
GeneName	POLR2L
Length	67
Function	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Common component of RNA polymerases I, II and III which synthesize ribosomal RNA precursors, mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs, and a small RNAs, such as 5S rRNA and tRNAs, respectively.
