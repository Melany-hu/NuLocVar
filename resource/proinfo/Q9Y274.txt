UniprotID	Q9Y274
Accession	Q9Y274;B2RCH2;B3KMI1;D3DN39;F8W6U0
EntryName	SIA10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Type 2 lactosamine alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.3.6) (CMP-NeuAc:beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase VI) (ST3Gal VI) (ST3GalVI) (Sialyltransferase 10)
GeneName	ST3GAL6 SIAT10
Length	331
Function	Transfers the sialyl residue from CMP-N-acetyl-beta-neuraminate to the terminal galactose residue on sugar chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids (PubMed:10206952, PubMed:26692484). It's alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase activity is specific toward type II glycan chains (Galbeta1-4GlcNAc) on glycoproteins and glycolipids such as neolactosides nLc4Cer and nLc6Cer, whose sialyl-products serve as precursors for the Lewis X antigen (PubMed:10206952, PubMed:26692484). Critically involved in the synthesis of functional selectin ligands needed for neutrophil recruitment during inflammation and lymphocyte homing to the lymph nodes (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
