UniprotID	O75934
Accession	O75934;Q6FGS0
EntryName	SPF27_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pre-mRNA-splicing factor SPF27 (Breast carcinoma-amplified sequence 2) (DNA amplified in mammary carcinoma 1 protein) (Spliceosome-associated protein SPF 27)
GeneName	BCAS2 DAM1
Length	225
Function	Required for pre-mRNA splicing as component of the activated spliceosome (PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:29301961, PubMed:29360106, PubMed:30705154). Component of the PRP19-CDC5L complex that forms an integral part of the spliceosome and is required for activating pre-mRNA splicing. May have a scaffolding role in the spliceosome assembly as it contacts all other components of the core complex. The PRP19-CDC5L complex may also play a role in the response to DNA damage (DDR).
