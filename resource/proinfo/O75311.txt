EntryName	GLRA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycine receptor subunit alpha-3
GeneName	GLRA3
Length	464
Function	Glycine receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels. Channel opening is triggered by extracellular glycine (PubMed:26416729, PubMed:9677400). Channel characteristics depend on the subunit composition; heteropentameric channels display faster channel closure (By similarity). Plays an important role in the down-regulation of neuronal excitability (By similarity). Contributes to the generation of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (By similarity). Contributes to increased pain perception in response to increased prostaglandin E2 levels (By similarity). Plays a role in cellular responses to ethanol (By similarity).
