UniprotID	Q9Y534
Accession	Q9Y534;Q8ND37
EntryName	CSDC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cold shock domain-containing protein C2 (RNA-binding protein PIPPin)
GeneName	CSDC2 PIPPIN
Length	153
Function	RNA-binding factor which binds specifically to the very 3'-UTR ends of both histone H1 and H3.3 mRNAs, encompassing the polyadenylation signal. Might play a central role in the negative regulation of histone variant synthesis in the developing brain (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm
