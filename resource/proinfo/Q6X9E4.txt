UniprotID	Q6X9E4
Accession	Q6X9E4;E9PG36;Q494Y9;Q494Z0
EntryName	FBW12_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 12 (F-box and WD-40 domain-containing protein 12) (F-box only protein 35)
GeneName	FBXW12 FBW12 FBXO12 FBXO35
Length	464
Function	Substrate-recognition component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (PubMed:26171402). Promotes degradation of interleukin-22 receptor subunit IL22RA1 in resting and IL22-stimulated conditions by facilitating its ubiquitination (PubMed:26171402). Functions as a cell growth suppressor (PubMed:26171402).
