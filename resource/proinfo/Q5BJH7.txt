UniprotID	Q5BJH7
Accession	Q5BJH7;H7BXS8;Q5JPC2;Q8WY70;Q96C02;Q96IC4
EntryName	YIF1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein YIF1B (YIP1-interacting factor homolog B)
GeneName	YIF1B PP4519 UNQ3073/PRO9905
Length	314
Function	Functions in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport and regulates the proper organization of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi (By similarity). Plays a key role in targeting to neuronal dendrites receptors such as HTR1A (By similarity). Plays also a role in primary cilium and sperm flagellum assembly probably through protein transport to these compartments (PubMed:33103737).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane
