UniprotID	Q96FJ2
Accession	Q96FJ2;B2R5B4
EntryName	DYL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynein light chain 2, cytoplasmic (8 kDa dynein light chain b) (DLC8b) (Dynein light chain LC8-type 2)
GeneName	DYNLL2 DLC2
Length	89
Function	Acts as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex that are thought to be involved in linking dynein to cargos and to adapter proteins that regulate dynein function. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. May play a role in changing or maintaining the spatial distribution of cytoskeletal structures (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
