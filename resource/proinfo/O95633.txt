UniprotID	O95633
Accession	O95633;A8K7E3
EntryName	FSTL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Follistatin-related protein 3 (Follistatin-like protein 3) (Follistatin-related gene protein)
GeneName	FSTL3 FLRG UNQ674/PRO1308
Length	263
Function	Isoform 1 or the secreted form is a binding and antagonizing protein for members of the TGF-beta family, such as activin, BMP2 and MSTN. Inhibits activin A-, activin B-, BMP2- and MSDT-induced cellular signaling; more effective on activin A than on activin B. Involved in bone formation; inhibits osteoclast differentiation. Involved in hematopoiesis; involved in differentiation of hemopoietic progenitor cells, increases hematopoietic cell adhesion to fibronectin and seems to contribute to the adhesion of hematopoietic precursor cells to the bone marrow stroma. Isoform 2 or the nuclear form is probably involved in transcriptional regulation via interaction with MLLT10.
