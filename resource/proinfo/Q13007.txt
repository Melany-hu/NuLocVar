UniprotID	Q13007
Accession	Q13007;Q2YHE5;Q53XZ7;Q5YLN8;Q96DB0;Q96KG4
EntryName	IL24_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-24 (IL-24) (Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 7 protein) (MDA-7) (Suppression of tumorigenicity 16 protein)
GeneName	IL24 MDA7 ST16
Length	206
Function	Multifunctional cytokine mainly produced by T-cells that plays a regulatory role in immune response, tissue homeostasis, host defense, and oncogenesis (PubMed:25168428, PubMed:27687232). Possesses antiviral functions and induces the type I interferon response during influenza infection (PubMed:27687232). Signals through two receptor complexes IL20RA/IL20RB or IL20RB/IL22RA1 (PubMed:11706020, PubMed:30111632). In turn, stimulates the JAK1-STAT3 and MAPK pathways and promotes the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL8 and MMP1 (PubMed:25168428). Intracellularly, maintains endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis by restricting the eIF2alpha-CHOP pathway-mediated stress signal (By similarity). In addition, acts as a quality control mechanism for the ubiquitin proteasome system by alerting the cell to proteasome dysfunction through activation of PKR/EIF2AK2 (By similarity).
