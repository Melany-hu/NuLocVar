EntryName	MESD_HUMAN
ProteinName	LRP chaperone MESD (LDLR chaperone MESD) (Mesoderm development LRP chaperone MESD) (Mesoderm development candidate 2) (Mesoderm development protein) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-61)
GeneName	MESD KIAA0081 MESDC2 MESDM UNQ1911/PRO4369
Length	234
Function	Chaperone specifically assisting the folding of beta-propeller/EGF modules within the family of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) (PubMed:15014448). Acts as a modulator of the Wnt pathway through chaperoning the coreceptors of the canonical Wnt pathway, LRP5 and LRP6, to the plasma membrane (PubMed:17488095, PubMed:23572575). Essential for specification of embryonic polarity and mesoderm induction. Plays an essential role in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation by promoting cell-surface expression of LRP4 (By similarity). May regulate phagocytosis of apoptotic retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (By similarity).
