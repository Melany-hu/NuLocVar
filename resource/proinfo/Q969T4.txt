UniprotID	Q969T4
Accession	Q969T4;B2RAD6;D3DPG3;Q5U0R7;Q7Z4W4
EntryName	UB2E3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E3 (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E3) (UbcH9) (Ubiquitin carrier protein E3) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-23 kDa) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase E3)
GeneName	UBE2E3 UBCE4 UBCH9
Length	207
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. In vitro catalyzes 'Lys-11'- and 'Lys-48'-, as well as 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination. Participates in the regulation of transepithelial sodium transport in renal cells.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm
