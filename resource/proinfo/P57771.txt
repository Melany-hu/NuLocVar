UniprotID	P57771
Accession	P57771;B4DGL9;Q3SYD2
EntryName	RGS8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 8 (RGS8)
GeneName	RGS8
Length	180
Function	Regulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades, including signaling via muscarinic acetylcholine receptor CHRM2 and dopamine receptor DRD2 (By similarity). Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits, thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form (PubMed:18434541). Modulates the activity of potassium channels that are activated in response to DRD2 and CHRM2 signaling (By similarity).
