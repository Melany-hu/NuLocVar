UniprotID	Q96PL1
Accession	Q96PL1
EntryName	SG3A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Secretoglobin family 3A member 2 (Pneumo secretory protein 1) (PnSP-1) (Uteroglobin-related protein 1)
GeneName	SCGB3A2 PNSP1 UGRP1 UNQ566/PRO1128
Length	93
Function	Secreted cytokine-like protein (PubMed:12847263). Binds to the scavenger receptor MARCO (PubMed:12847263). Can also bind to pathogens including the Gram-positive bacterium L.monocytogenes, the Gram-negative bacterium P.aeruginosa, and yeast (PubMed:12847263). Strongly inhibits phospholipase A2 (PLA2G1B) activity (PubMed:24213919). Seems to have anti-inflammatory effects in respiratory epithelium (By similarity). Also has anti-fibrotic activity in lung (PubMed:24213919). May play a role in fetal lung development and maturation (PubMed:24213919). Promotes branching morphogenesis during early stages of lung development (PubMed:24213919). In the pituitary, may inhibit production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (By similarity).
