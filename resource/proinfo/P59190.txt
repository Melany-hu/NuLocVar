UniprotID	P59190
Accession	P59190;G5EMR7;Q86TX7;Q8IW89
EntryName	RAB15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-15 (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB15
Length	212
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes (By similarity). Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (By similarity). RAB15 may act in concert with RAB3A in regulating aspects of synaptic vesicle membrane flow within the nerve terminal (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
