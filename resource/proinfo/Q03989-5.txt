EntryName	ARI5A_HUMAN
ProteinName	AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 5A (ARID domain-containing protein 5A) (Modulator recognition factor 1) (MRF-1)
GeneName	ARID5A MRF1
Length	526
Function	DNA-binding protein that may regulate transcription and act as a repressor by binding to AT-rich stretches in the promoter region of target genes (PubMed:8649988). May positively regulate chondrocyte-specific transcription such as of COL2A1 in collaboration with SOX9 and positively regulate histone H3 acetylation at chondrocyte-specific genes. May stimulate early-stage chondrocyte differentiation and inhibit later stage differention (By similarity). Can repress ESR1-mediated transcriptional activation; proposed to act as corepressor for selective nuclear hormone receptors (PubMed:15941852). As an RNA-binding protein, involved in the regulation of inflammatory response by stabilizing selective inflammation-related mRNAs, such as STAT3 and TBX21 (By similarity). Also stabilizes IL6 mRNA (PubMed:32209697). Binds to stem loop structures located in the 3'UTRs of IL6, STAT3 and TBX21 mRNAs; at least for STAT3 prevents binding of ZC3H12A to the mRNA stem loop structure thus inhibiting its degradation activity. Contributes to elevated IL6 levels possibly implicated in autoimmunity processes. IL6-dependent stabilization of STAT3 mRNA may promote differentiation of naive CD4+ T-cells into T-helper Th17 cells. In CD4+ T-cells may also inhibit RORC-induced Th17 cell differentiation independently of IL6 signaling. Stabilization of TBX21 mRNA contributes to elevated interferon-gamma secretion in Th1 cells possibly implicated in the establishment of septic shock (By similarity). Stabilizes TNFRSF4/OX40 mRNA by binding to the conserved stem loop structure in its 3'UTR; thereby competing with the mRNA-destabilizing functions of RC3H1 and endoribonuclease ZC3H12A (By similarity).
