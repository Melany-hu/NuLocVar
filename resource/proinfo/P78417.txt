UniprotID	P78417
Accession	P78417;D3DRA3;F5H7H0;Q5TA03;Q7Z3T2
EntryName	GSTO1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutathione S-transferase omega-1 (GSTO-1) (EC 2.5.1.18) (Glutathione S-transferase omega 1-1) (GSTO 1-1) (Glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase) (EC 1.8.5.1) (Monomethylarsonic acid reductase) (MMA(V) reductase) (EC 1.20.4.2) (S-(Phenacyl)glutathione reductase) (SPG-R)
GeneName	GSTO1 GSTTLP28
Length	241
Function	Exhibits glutathione-dependent thiol transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities. Has S-(phenacyl)glutathione reductase activity. Also has glutathione S-transferase activity. Participates in the biotransformation of inorganic arsenic and reduces monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsonic acid.
