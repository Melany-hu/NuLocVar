UniprotID	Q9UEU0
Accession	Q9UEU0;O43547;Q96J28
EntryName	VTI1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vesicle transport through interaction with t-SNAREs homolog 1B (Vesicle transport v-SNARE protein Vti1-like 1) (Vti1-rp1)
GeneName	VTI1B VTI1 VTI1L VTI1L1 VTI2
Length	232
Function	V-SNARE that mediates vesicle transport pathways through interactions with t-SNAREs on the target membrane. These interactions are proposed to mediate aspects of the specificity of vesicle trafficking and to promote fusion of the lipid bilayers. May be concerned with increased secretion of cytokines associated with cellular senescence.
Subcellular Location	Early endosome membrane; Late endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane; Cytoplasmic granule; Recycling endosome membrane
