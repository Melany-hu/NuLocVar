UniprotID	Q6IPR3
Accession	Q6IPR3;B4DSP9;E9PGR7;Q5HYJ0;Q8N7L1
EntryName	TYW3_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA wybutosine-synthesizing protein 3 homolog (tRNA-yW-synthesizing protein 3) (EC 2.1.1.282) (tRNA(Phe) 7-((3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)-4-demethylwyosine(37)-N(4))-methyltransferase)
GeneName	TYW3 C1orf171
Length	259
Function	Probable S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase that acts as a component of the wybutosine biosynthesis pathway. Wybutosine is a hyper modified guanosine with a tricyclic base found at the 3'-position adjacent to the anticodon of eukaryotic phenylalanine tRNA (By similarity).
