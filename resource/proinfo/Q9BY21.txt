UniprotID	Q9BY21
Accession	Q9BY21;Q5KU35;Q96JZ8;Q9BXC2
EntryName	GPR87_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 87 (G-protein coupled receptor 95)
GeneName	GPR87 GPR95 FKSG78
Length	358
Function	Receptor for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (PubMed:17905198). Necessary for p53/TP53-dependent survival in response to DNA damage (PubMed:19602589). Promotes the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway and thereby modulates glycolysis and oxidative stress production by the regulation of hexokinase-2/HK2 (PubMed:35843477).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
