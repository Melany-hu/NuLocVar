EntryName	MOB1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	MOB kinase activator 1A (Mob1 alpha) (Mob1A) (Mob1 homolog 1B) (Mps one binder kinase activator-like 1B)
GeneName	MOB1A C2orf6 MOB4B MOBK1B MOBKL1B
Length	216
Function	Activator of LATS1/2 in the Hippo signaling pathway which plays a pivotal role in organ size control and tumor suppression by restricting proliferation and promoting apoptosis. The core of this pathway is composed of a kinase cascade wherein STK3/MST2 and STK4/MST1, in complex with its regulatory protein SAV1, phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2 in complex with its regulatory protein MOB1, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates YAP1 oncoprotein and WWTR1/TAZ. Phosphorylation of YAP1 by LATS1/2 inhibits its translocation into the nucleus to regulate cellular genes important for cell proliferation, cell death, and cell migration. Stimulates the kinase activity of STK38 and STK38L. Acts cooperatively with STK3/MST2 to activate STK38.
