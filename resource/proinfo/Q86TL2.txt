UniprotID	Q86TL2
Accession	Q86TL2
EntryName	STIMA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Store-operated calcium entry regulator STIMATE (STIM-activating enhancer encoded by TMEM110) (Transmembrane protein 110)
GeneName	STIMATE TMEM110
Length	294
Function	Acts as a regulator of store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) at junctional sites that connect the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM), called ER-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junction or cortical ER (PubMed:26322679, PubMed:26644574). SOCE is a Ca(2+) influx following depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) stores (PubMed:26322679). Acts by interacting with STIM1, promoting STIM1 conformational switch (PubMed:26322679). Involved in STIM1 relocalization to ER-PM junctions (PubMed:26644574). Contributes to the maintenance and reorganization of store-dependent ER-PM junctions (PubMed:26644574).
