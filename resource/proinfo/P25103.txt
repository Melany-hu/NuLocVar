UniprotID	P25103
Accession	P25103;A8K150
EntryName	NK1R_HUMAN
ProteinName	Substance-P receptor (SPR) (NK-1 receptor) (NK-1R) (Tachykinin receptor 1)
GeneName	TACR1 NK1R TAC1R
Length	407
Function	This is a receptor for the tachykinin neuropeptide substance P. It is probably associated with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. The rank order of affinity of this receptor to tachykinins is: substance P > substance K > neuromedin-K.
