UniprotID	P19875
Accession	P19875;Q6FGD6;Q9UPB8
EntryName	CXCL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-X-C motif chemokine 2 (Growth-regulated protein beta) (Gro-beta) (Macrophage inflammatory protein 2-alpha) (MIP2-alpha) [Cleaved into: GRO-beta(5-73) (GRO-beta-T) (Hematopoietic synergistic factor) (HSF) (SB-251353)]
GeneName	CXCL2 GRO2 GROB MIP2A SCYB2
Length	107
Function	Produced by activated monocytes and neutrophils and expressed at sites of inflammation. Hematoregulatory chemokine, which, in vitro, suppresses hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation. GRO-beta(5-73) shows a highly enhanced hematopoietic activity.
