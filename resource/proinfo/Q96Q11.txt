EntryName	TRNT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	CCA tRNA nucleotidyltransferase 1, mitochondrial (EC 2.7.7.72) (Mitochondrial tRNA nucleotidyl transferase, CCA-adding) (mt CCA-adding enzyme) (mt tRNA CCA-diphosphorylase) (mt tRNA CCA-pyrophosphorylase) (mt tRNA adenylyltransferase)
GeneName	TRNT1 CGI-47
Length	434
Function	Nucleotidyltransferase that catalyzes the addition and repair of the essential 3'-terminal CCA sequence in tRNAs, which is necessary for the attachment of amino acids to the 3' terminus of tRNA molecules, using CTP and ATP as substrates (PubMed:11504732, PubMed:25193871, PubMed:25640237, PubMed:25652405, PubMed:29454993, PubMed:30959222, PubMed:31011209, PubMed:34023389). tRNA 3'-terminal CCA addition is required both for tRNA processing and repair (PubMed:22076379, PubMed:25640237). Promotes tRNA repair and recycling downstream of the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway by mediating addition of the tRNA 3'-terminal CCA following cleavage by ANKZF1 and repair by ELAC1 (PubMed:31011209). Also involved in tRNA surveillance by mediating tandem CCA addition to generate a CCACCA at the 3' terminus of unstable tRNAs and tRNA-like transcripts (PubMed:22076379, PubMed:25640237). While stable tRNAs receive only 3'-terminal CCA, unstable tRNAs beginning with GG are marked with CCACCA and rapidly degraded (PubMed:22076379, PubMed:25640237). The structural flexibility of RNA controls the choice between CCA versus CCACCA addition: following the first CCA addition cycle, nucleotide-binding to the active site triggers a clockwise screw motion, producing torque on the RNA (PubMed:25640237). This ejects stable RNAs, whereas unstable RNAs are refolded while bound to the enzyme and subjected to a second CCA catalytic cycle (PubMed:25640237).
