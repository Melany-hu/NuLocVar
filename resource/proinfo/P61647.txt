UniprotID	P61647
Accession	P61647;B0YJ97;B9EH72;Q5VZH4
EntryName	SIA8F_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 8F (EC 2.4.99.-) (Sialyltransferase 8F) (SIAT8-F) (Sialyltransferase St8Sia VI) (ST8SiaVI)
GeneName	ST8SIA6 SIAT8F
Length	398
Function	Alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase that prefers O-glycans to N-glycans or glycolipids as acceptor substrates. The minimal acceptor substrate is the NeuAc-alpha-2,3(6)-Gal sequence at the non-reducing end of their carbohydrate groups.
