UniprotID	Q96RM1
Accession	Q96RM1;Q5T9T3
EntryName	SPR2F_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small proline-rich protein 2F (SPR-2F)
GeneName	SPRR2F
Length	72
Function	Cross-linked envelope protein of keratinocytes. It is a keratinocyte protein that first appears in the cell cytosol, but ultimately becomes cross-linked to membrane proteins by transglutaminase. All that results in the formation of an insoluble envelope beneath the plasma membrane (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
