UniprotID	O43508
Accession	O43508;Q8IZK7;Q8WUZ7
EntryName	TNF12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 12 (APO3 ligand) (TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis) (TWEAK) [Cleaved into: Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 12, membrane form; Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 12, secreted form]
GeneName	TNFSF12 APO3L DR3LG UNQ181/PRO207
Length	249
Function	Binds to FN14 and possibly also to TNRFSF12/APO3. Weak inducer of apoptosis in some cell types. Mediates NF-kappa-B activation. Promotes angiogenesis and the proliferation of endothelial cells. Also involved in induction of inflammatory cytokines. Promotes IL8 secretion.
