EntryName	TRPV4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TrpV4) (Osm-9-like TRP channel 4) (OTRPC4) (Transient receptor potential protein 12) (TRP12) (Vanilloid receptor-like channel 2) (Vanilloid receptor-like protein 2) (VRL-2) (Vanilloid receptor-related osmotically-activated channel) (VR-OAC)
GeneName	TRPV4 VRL2 VROAC
Length	871
Function	Non-selective calcium permeant cation channel involved in osmotic sensitivity and mechanosensitivity (PubMed:16293632, PubMed:18695040, PubMed:18826956, PubMed:22526352, PubMed:23136043, PubMed:29899501). Activation by exposure to hypotonicity within the physiological range exhibits an outward rectification (PubMed:18695040, PubMed:18826956, PubMed:29899501). Also activated by heat, low pH, citrate and phorbol esters (PubMed:16293632, PubMed:18695040, PubMed:18826956, PubMed:20037586, PubMed:21964574, PubMed:25256292). Increase of intracellular Ca(2+) potentiates currents. Channel activity seems to be regulated by a calmodulin-dependent mechanism with a negative feedback mechanism (PubMed:12724311, PubMed:18826956). Promotes cell-cell junction formation in skin keratinocytes and plays an important role in the formation and/or maintenance of functional intercellular barriers (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of intracellular Ca(2+) in synoviocytes (PubMed:19759329). Plays an obligatory role as a molecular component in the nonselective cation channel activation induced by 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate and hypotonic stimulation in synoviocytes and also regulates production of IL-8 (PubMed:19759329). Together with PKD2, forms mechano- and thermosensitive channels in cilium (PubMed:18695040). Negatively regulates expression of PPARGC1A, UCP1, oxidative metabolism and respiration in adipocytes (By similarity). Regulates expression of chemokines and cytokines related to pro-inflammatory pathway in adipocytes (By similarity). Together with AQP5, controls regulatory volume decrease in salivary epithelial cells (By similarity). Required for normal development and maintenance of bone and cartilage (PubMed:26249260). In its inactive state, may sequester DDX3X at the plasma membrane. When activated, the interaction between both proteins is affected and DDX3X relocalizes to the nucleus (PubMed:29899501). In neurons of the central nervous system, could play a role in triggering voluntary water intake in response to increased sodium concentration in body fluid (By similarity).
