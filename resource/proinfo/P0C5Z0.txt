UniprotID	P0C5Z0
Accession	P0C5Z0;A1L4E4;P98176;Q5TZB2;Q6FG78;Q96PR7
EntryName	H2AB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A-Bbd type 2/3 (H2A Barr body-deficient) (H2A.Bbd)
GeneName	H2AB2 H2AFB2; H2AB3 H2ABBD H2AFB H2AFB3
Length	115
Function	Atypical histone H2A which can replace conventional H2A in some nucleosomes and is associated with active transcription and mRNA processing. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. Nucleosomes containing this histone are less rigid and organize less DNA than canonical nucleosomes in vivo. They are enriched in actively transcribed genes and associate with the elongating form of RNA polymerase. They associate with spliceosome components and are required for mRNA splicing. May participate in spermatogenesis.
