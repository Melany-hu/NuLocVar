UniprotID	P31946
Accession	P31946;A8K9K2;E1P616
EntryName	1433B_HUMAN
ProteinName	14-3-3 protein beta/alpha (Protein 1054) (Protein kinase C inhibitor protein 1) (KCIP-1) [Cleaved into: 14-3-3 protein beta/alpha, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	YWHAB
Length	246
Function	Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathways. Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner. Negative regulator of osteogenesis. Blocks the nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated form (by AKT1) of SRPK2 and antagonizes its stimulatory effect on cyclin D1 expression resulting in blockage of neuronal apoptosis elicited by SRPK2. Negative regulator of signaling cascades that mediate activation of MAP kinases via AKAP13.
