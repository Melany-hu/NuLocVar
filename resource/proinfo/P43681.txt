Function	Component of neuronal acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that function as pentameric, ligand-gated cation channels with high calcium permeability among other activities. nAChRs are excitatory neurotrasnmitter receptors formed by a collection of nAChR subunits known to mediate synaptic transmission in the nervous system and the neuromuscular junction. Each nAchR subunit confers differential attributes to channel properties, including activation, deactivation and desensitization kinetics, pH sensitivity, cation permeability, and binding to allosteric modulators (PubMed:22361591, PubMed:27698419, PubMed:29720657, PubMed:38454578). CHRNA4 forms heteropentameric neuronal acetylcholine receptors with CHRNB2 and CHRNB4, as well as CHRNA5 and CHRNB3 as accesory subunits. Is the most abundant nAChR subtype expressed in the central nervous system (PubMed:16835356, PubMed:22361591, PubMed:27698419, PubMed:29720657, PubMed:38454578). Found in two major stoichiometric forms,(CHRNA4)3:(CHRNB2)2 and (CHRNA4)2:(CHRNB2)3, the two stoichiometric forms differ in their unitary conductance, calcium permeability, ACh sensitivity and potentiation by divalent cation (PubMed:27698419, PubMed:29720657, PubMed:38454578). Involved in the modulation of calcium-dependent signaling pathways, influences the release of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, glutamate and GABA (By similarity).
