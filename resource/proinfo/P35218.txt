UniprotID	P35218
Accession	P35218;B2RPF2
EntryName	CAH5A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carbonic anhydrase 5A, mitochondrial (EC 4.2.1.1) (Carbonate dehydratase VA) (Carbonic anhydrase VA) (CA-VA)
GeneName	CA5A CA5
Length	305
Function	Mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase that catalyzes the reversible conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate/HCO3 (PubMed:24530203, PubMed:8356065). Mitochondria are impermeable to HCO3, and thus this intramitochondrial carbonic anhydrase is pivotal in providing HCO3 for multiple mitochondrial enzymes that catalyze the formation of essential metabolites of intermediary metabolism in the urea and Krebs cycles (PubMed:24530203).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
