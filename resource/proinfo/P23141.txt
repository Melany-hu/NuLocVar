ProteinName	Liver carboxylesterase 1 (Acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase) (ACAT) (Brain carboxylesterase hBr1) (Carboxylesterase 1) (CE-1) (hCE-1) (EC 3.1.1.1) (Cholesteryl ester hydrolase) (CEH) (EC 3.1.1.13) (Cocaine carboxylesterase) (Egasyn) (HMSE) (Methylumbelliferyl-acetate deacetylase 1) (EC 3.1.1.56) (Monocyte/macrophage serine esterase) (Retinyl ester hydrolase) (REH) (Serine esterase 1) (Triacylglycerol hydrolase) (TGH)
GeneName	CES1 CES2 SES1
Length	567
Function	Involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics and in the activation of ester and amide prodrugs (PubMed:18762277, PubMed:7980644, PubMed:9169443, PubMed:9490062). Hydrolyzes aromatic and aliphatic esters, but has no catalytic activity toward amides or a fatty acyl-CoA ester (PubMed:18762277, PubMed:7980644, PubMed:9169443, PubMed:9490062). Hydrolyzes the methyl ester group of cocaine to form benzoylecgonine (PubMed:7980644). Catalyzes the transesterification of cocaine to form cocaethylene (PubMed:7980644). Displays fatty acid ethyl ester synthase activity, catalyzing the ethyl esterification of oleic acid to ethyloleate (PubMed:7980644). Converts monoacylglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol. Hydrolyzes of 2-arachidonoylglycerol and prostaglandins (PubMed:21049984). Hydrolyzes cellular cholesteryl esters to free cholesterols and promotes reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) by facilitating both the initial and final steps in the process (PubMed:11015575, PubMed:16024911, PubMed:16971496, PubMed:18762277). First of all, allows free cholesterol efflux from macrophages to extracellular cholesterol acceptors and secondly, releases free cholesterol from lipoprotein-delivered cholesteryl esters in the liver for bile acid synthesis or direct secretion into the bile (PubMed:16971496, PubMed:18599737, PubMed:18762277).
