UniprotID	O43825
Accession	O43825;B2RAB1;Q9BZQ9
EntryName	B3GT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 2 (Beta-1,3-GalTase 2) (Beta3Gal-T2) (Beta3GalT2) (EC 2.4.1.86) (UDP-galactose:2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose 3beta-galactosyltransferase 2)
GeneName	B3GALT2
Length	422
Function	Beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase that transfers galactose from UDP-galactose to substrates with a terminal beta-N-acetylglucosamine (beta-GlcNAc) residue. Can also utilize substrates with a terminal galactose residue, albeit with lower efficiency. Involved in the biosynthesis of the carbohydrate moieties of glycolipids and glycoproteins. Inactive towards substrates with terminal alpha-N-acetylglucosamine (alpha-GlcNAc) or alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine (alpha-GalNAc) residues.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
