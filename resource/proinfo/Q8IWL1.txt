EntryName	SFPA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pulmonary surfactant-associated protein A2 (PSP-A) (PSPA) (SP-A) (SP-A2) (35 kDa pulmonary surfactant-associated protein) (Alveolar proteinosis protein) (Collectin-5)
GeneName	SFTPA2 COLEC5 PSAP SFTP1 SFTPA SFTPA2B
Length	248
Function	In presence of calcium ions, it binds to surfactant phospholipids and contributes to lower the surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli of the mammalian lung and is essential for normal respiration.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Secreted; Extracellular space; Extracellular matrix; Secreted; Extracellular space; Surface film
