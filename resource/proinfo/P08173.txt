UniprotID	P08173
Accession	P08173;B2RPP4;Q0VD60;Q4VBK7
EntryName	ACM4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4
GeneName	CHRM4
Length	479
Function	The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mediates various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins. Primary transducing effect is inhibition of adenylate cyclase.
