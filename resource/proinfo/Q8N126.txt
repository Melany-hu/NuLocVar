UniprotID	Q8N126
Accession	Q8N126;Q8IZQ9;Q9NVJ5;Q9UJP1
EntryName	CADM3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cell adhesion molecule 3 (Brain immunoglobulin receptor) (Immunoglobulin superfamily member 4B) (IgSF4B) (Nectin-like protein 1) (NECL-1) (Synaptic cell adhesion molecule 3) (SynCAM3) (TSLC1-like protein 1) (TSLL1)
GeneName	CADM3 IGSF4B NECL1 SYNCAM3 TSLL1 UNQ225/PRO258
Length	398
Function	Involved in cell-cell adhesion. Has both calcium-independent homophilic cell-cell adhesion activity and calcium-independent heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activity with IGSF4, NECTIN1 and NECTIN3. Interaction with EPB41L1 may regulate structure or function of cell-cell junctions (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell junction
