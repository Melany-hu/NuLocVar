UniprotID	Q9UBR4
Accession	Q9UBR4;Q5TB39;Q5TB40;Q9NZB5;Q9P0I8;Q9P0I9
EntryName	LHX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	LIM/homeobox protein Lhx3 (LIM homeobox protein 3)
GeneName	LHX3
Length	397
Function	Transcription factor. Recognizes and binds to the consensus sequence motif 5'-AATTAATTA-3' in the regulatory elements of target genes, such as glycoprotein hormones alpha chain CGA and visual system homeobox CHX10, positively modulating transcription; transcription can be co-activated by LDB2. Synergistically enhances transcription from the prolactin promoter in cooperation with POU1F1/Pit-1 (By similarity). Required for the establishment of the specialized cells of the pituitary gland and the nervous system (PubMed:21149718). Involved in the development of interneurons and motor neurons in cooperation with LDB1 and ISL1 (By similarity).
