UniprotID	O75818
Accession	O75818;Q5VX97;Q8WVK8
EntryName	RPP40_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease P protein subunit p40 (RNaseP protein p40) (RNase P subunit 1)
GeneName	RPP40 RNASEP1
Length	363
Function	Component of ribonuclease P, a ribonucleoprotein complex that generates mature tRNA molecules by cleaving their 5'-ends (PubMed:30454648, PubMed:9630247). Also a component of the MRP ribonuclease complex, which cleaves pre-rRNA sequences (PubMed:28115465).
