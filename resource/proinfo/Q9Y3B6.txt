EntryName	EMC9_HUMAN
ProteinName	ER membrane protein complex subunit 9 (Protein FAM158A)
GeneName	EMC9 C14orf122 FAM158A CGI-112
Length	208
Function	Part of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex (EMC) that enables the energy-independent insertion into endoplasmic reticulum membranes of newly synthesized membrane proteins (PubMed:29242231, PubMed:29809151, PubMed:30415835, PubMed:32459176). Preferentially accommodates proteins with transmembrane domains that are weakly hydrophobic or contain destabilizing features such as charged and aromatic residues (PubMed:29242231, PubMed:29809151, PubMed:30415835). Involved in the cotranslational insertion of multi-pass membrane proteins in which stop-transfer membrane-anchor sequences become ER membrane spanning helices (PubMed:29809151, PubMed:30415835). It is also required for the post-translational insertion of tail-anchored/TA proteins in endoplasmic reticulum membranes (PubMed:29242231, PubMed:29809151). By mediating the proper cotranslational insertion of N-terminal transmembrane domains in an N-exo topology, with translocated N-terminus in the lumen of the ER, controls the topology of multi-pass membrane proteins like the G protein-coupled receptors (PubMed:30415835). By regulating the insertion of various proteins in membranes, it is indirectly involved in many cellular processes (Probable).
