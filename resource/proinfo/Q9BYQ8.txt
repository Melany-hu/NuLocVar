UniprotID	Q9BYQ8
Accession	Q9BYQ8
EntryName	KRA49_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 4-9 (Keratin-associated protein 4.9) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 4.9)
GeneName	KRTAP4-9 KAP4.9 KRTAP4.9
Length	210
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
