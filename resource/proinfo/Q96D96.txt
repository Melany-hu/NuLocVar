EntryName	HVCN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Voltage-gated hydrogen channel 1 (Hydrogen voltage-gated channel 1) (HV1) (Voltage sensor domain-only protein)
GeneName	HVCN1 VSOP UNQ578/PRO1140
Length	273
Function	Voltage-gated proton-selective channel that conducts outward proton currents in response to intracellular acidification. Lacks a canonical ion-channel pore domain and mediates proton permeability via its voltage sensor domain (PubMed:16554753, PubMed:20037153, PubMed:20548053, PubMed:22020278, PubMed:27859356, PubMed:30478045, PubMed:37669933). Appears to play a dominant role in regulation of CO2/HCO3(-)/H(+) equilibrium in sperm flagellum. Prevents the acidification resulting from HCO3(-) synthesis and thus sustains high HCO3(-) levels inside sperm for capacitation (PubMed:20144758, PubMed:30478045, PubMed:37669933). Provides for proton efflux that compensates for electron charge generated by NADPH oxidase activity either in the extracellular or phagosomal compartments, thus enabling the production of high levels of bactericidal reactive oxygen species during the respiratory burst (PubMed:20037153, PubMed:30478045). Opens when the pH of airway surface liquid exceeds 7 and contributes to respiratory epithelial acid secretion to maintain pH in the mucosa (PubMed:20548053).
