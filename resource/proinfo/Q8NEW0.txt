UniprotID	Q8NEW0
Accession	Q8NEW0;B2R949;D3DT61;Q8TCH2
EntryName	ZNT7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc transporter 7 (ZnT-7) (Solute carrier family 30 member 7) (Znt-like transporter 2)
GeneName	SLC30A7 ZNT7 ZNTL2
Length	376
Function	Zinc ion transporter mediating zinc entry from the cytosol into the lumen of organelles along the secretory pathway (PubMed:15525635, PubMed:15994300). By contributing to zinc ion homeostasis within the early secretory pathway, regulates the activation and folding of enzymes like alkaline phosphatases (PubMed:15525635, PubMed:15994300).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network; Sarcoplasmic reticulum; Mitochondrion
