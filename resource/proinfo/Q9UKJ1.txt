UniprotID	Q9UKJ1
Accession	Q9UKJ1;Q8NHI1
EntryName	PILRA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor alpha (Cell surface receptor FDF03) (Inhibitory receptor PILR-alpha)
GeneName	PILRA
Length	303
Function	Paired receptors consist of highly related activating and inhibitory receptors and are widely involved in the regulation of the immune system. PILRA is thought to act as a cellular signaling inhibitory receptor by recruiting cytoplasmic phosphatases like PTPN6/SHP-1 and PTPN11/SHP-2 via their SH2 domains that block signal transduction through dephosphorylation of signaling molecules. Receptor for PIANP.
