EntryName	S2539_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial glutathione transporter SLC25A39 (Solute carrier family 25 member 39)
GeneName	SLC25A39 CGI-69 PRO2163
Length	359
Function	Mitochondrial transporter required for glutathione import into mitochondria (PubMed:34707288, PubMed:35513392, PubMed:37917749, PubMed:38157846). Glutathione, which plays key roles in oxidative metabolism, is produced exclusively in the cytosol and is imported in many organelles (PubMed:34707288). Mitochondrial glutathione is required for the activity and stability of proteins containing iron-sulfur clusters, as well as erythropoiesis (PubMed:34707288).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
