UniprotID	O95476
Accession	O95476;D3DTN7;Q96GQ9
EntryName	CNEP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	CTD nuclear envelope phosphatase 1 (EC 3.1.3.16) (Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase dullard)
GeneName	CTDNEP1 DULLARD
Length	244
Function	Serine/threonine protein phosphatase forming with CNEP1R1 an active phosphatase complex that dephosphorylates and may activate LPIN1 and LPIN2. LPIN1 and LPIN2 are phosphatidate phosphatases that catalyze the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol and control the metabolism of fatty acids at different levels. May indirectly modulate the lipid composition of nuclear and/or endoplasmic reticulum membranes and be required for proper nuclear membrane morphology and/or dynamics. May also indirectly regulate the production of lipid droplets and triacylglycerol. May antagonize BMP signaling.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Nucleus membrane
