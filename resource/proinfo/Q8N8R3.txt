UniprotID	Q8N8R3
Accession	Q8N8R3;A3KMR5;Q541V0
EntryName	S2529_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial basic amino acids transporter (Carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase-like) (CACT-like) (Mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier protein CACL) (Mitochondrial ornithine transporter 3) (Solute carrier family 25 member 29)
GeneName	SLC25A29 C14orf69 ORNT3
Length	303
Function	Mitochondrial transporter of arginine, lysine, homoarginine, methylarginine and, to a much lesser extent, ornithine and histidine (PubMed:19287344, PubMed:24652292). Does not transport carnitine nor acylcarnitines (PubMed:24652292). Functions by both counter-exchange and uniport mechanisms (PubMed:24652292). Plays a physiological role in the import of basic amino acids into mitochondria for mitochondrial protein synthesis and amino acid degradation (PubMed:19287344, PubMed:24652292).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
