UniprotID	Q9Y661
Accession	Q9Y661;Q5QI42;Q8NDC2
EntryName	HS3S4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heparan sulfate glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 4 (EC 2.8.2.23) (Heparan sulfate D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase 4) (3-OST-4) (Heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 4) (h3-OST-4)
GeneName	HS3ST4 3OST4
Length	456
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) to catalyze the transfer of a sulfo group to an N-unsubstituted glucosamine linked to a 2-O-sulfo iduronic acid unit on heparan sulfate. Unlike 3-OST-1, does not convert non-anticoagulant heparan sulfate to anticoagulant heparan sulfate (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
