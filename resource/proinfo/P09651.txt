UniprotID	P09651
Accession	P09651;A8K4Z8;Q3MIB7;Q6PJZ7
EntryName	ROA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) (Helix-destabilizing protein) (Single-strand RNA-binding protein) (hnRNP core protein A1) [Cleaved into: Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	HNRNPA1 HNRPA1
Length	372
Function	Involved in the packaging of pre-mRNA into hnRNP particles, transport of poly(A) mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and modulation of splice site selection (PubMed:17371836). Plays a role in the splicing of pyruvate kinase PKM by binding repressively to sequences flanking PKM exon 9, inhibiting exon 9 inclusion and resulting in exon 10 inclusion and production of the PKM M2 isoform (PubMed:20010808). Binds to the IRES and thereby inhibits the translation of the apoptosis protease activating factor APAF1 (PubMed:31498791). May bind to specific miRNA hairpins (PubMed:28431233).
