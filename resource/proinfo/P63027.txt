UniprotID	P63027
Accession	P63027;P19065;Q9BUC2
EntryName	VAMP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP-2) (Synaptobrevin-2)
GeneName	VAMP2 SYB2
Length	116
Function	Involved in the targeting and/or fusion of transport vesicles to their target membrane (By similarity). Major SNARE protein of synaptic vesicles which mediates fusion of synaptic vesicles to release neurotransmitters. Essential for fast vesicular exocytosis and activity-dependent neurotransmitter release as well as fast endocytosis that mediates rapid reuse of synaptic vesicles (By similarity) (PubMed:30929742). Modulates the gating characteristics of the delayed rectifier voltage-dependent potassium channel KCNB1.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane; Cell membrane
