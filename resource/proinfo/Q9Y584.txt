UniprotID	Q9Y584
Accession	Q9Y584;Q9NWI8
EntryName	TIM22_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim22 (Testis-expressed protein 4)
GeneName	TIMM22 TEX4 TIM22
Length	194
Function	Essential core component of the TIM22 complex, a complex that mediates the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. In the TIM22 complex, it constitutes the voltage-activated and signal-gated channel. Forms a twin-pore translocase that uses the membrane potential as external driving force in 2 voltage-dependent steps (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
