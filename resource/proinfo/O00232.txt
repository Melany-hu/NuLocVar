UniprotID	O00232
Accession	O00232;A6NP15;Q53HA2;Q6P053
EntryName	PSD12_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 12 (26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN5) (26S proteasome regulatory subunit p55)
GeneName	PSMD12
Length	456
Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair.
