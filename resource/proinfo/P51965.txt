UniprotID	P51965
Accession	P51965;B2RBX4;C9J8K2;K4DI90
EntryName	UB2E1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E1 (EC 2.3.2.23) ((E3-independent) E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E1) (EC 2.3.2.24) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E1) (UbcH6) (Ubiquitin carrier protein E1) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase E1)
GeneName	UBE2E1 UBCH6
Length	193
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ISG15 to other proteins. Mediates the selective degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins. In vitro also catalyzes 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination. Catalyzes monoubiquitination of other proteins in both an E3-dependent and E3-independent manner (PubMed:27237050).
