UniprotID	P78415
Accession	P78415;Q7Z4A4;Q7Z4A5;Q8IVC6
EntryName	IRX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Iroquois-class homeodomain protein IRX-3 (Homeodomain protein IRXB1) (Iroquois homeobox protein 3)
GeneName	IRX3 IRXB1
Length	501
Function	Transcription factor involved in SHH-dependent neural patterning. Together with NKX2-2 and NKX6-1 acts to restrict the generation of motor neurons to the appropriate region of the neural tube. Belongs to the class I proteins of neuronal progenitor factors, which are repressed by SHH signals. Involved in the transcriptional repression of MNX1 in non-motor neuron cells. Acts as a regulator of energy metabolism.
