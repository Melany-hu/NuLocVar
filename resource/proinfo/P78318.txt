UniprotID	P78318
Accession	P78318;Q8TAB2
EntryName	IGBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Immunoglobulin-binding protein 1 (B-cell signal transduction molecule alpha 4) (Protein alpha-4) (CD79a-binding protein 1) (Protein phosphatase 2/4/6 regulatory subunit) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-16)
GeneName	IGBP1 IBP1
Length	339
Function	Associated to surface IgM-receptor; may be involved in signal transduction. Involved in regulation of the catalytic activity of the phosphatases PP2A, PP4 and PP6 by protecting their partially folded catalytic subunits from degradative polyubiquitination until they associate with regulatory subunits.
