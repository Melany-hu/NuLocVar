EntryName	THA11_HUMAN
ProteinName	THAP domain-containing protein 11
GeneName	THAP11 HRIHFB2206
Length	314
Function	Transcription factor, which has both transcriptional activation and repression activities (PubMed:31905202). Also modulates chromatin accessibility (PubMed:38361031). In complex with HCFC1 and ZNF143, regulates the expression of several genes, including AP2S1, ESCO2, OPHN1, RBL1, UBXN8 and ZNF32 (PubMed:26416877). May regulate the expression of genes that encode both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (By similarity). Required for normal mitochondrial development and function. Regulates mitochondrial gene expression, including that of components of the electron transport chain (By similarity). Involved in the maintainance of pluripotency in early embryonic cells, possibly through its action on mitochondrial maturation which is required to meet high energy demands of these cells (By similarity). Required for early development of retina, preventing premature exit of retinal progenitor cells from the cell cycle. This effect may also be mediated by its action on mitochondria (By similarity). Through the regulation of MMACHC gene expression, controls cobalamin metabolism (PubMed:28449119, PubMed:31905202). Required for normal brain development and neural precursor differentiation (By similarity). Involved in cell growth (PubMed:31905202).
