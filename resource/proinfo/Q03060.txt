EntryName	CREM_HUMAN
ProteinName	cAMP-responsive element modulator (Inducible cAMP early repressor) (ICER)
GeneName	CREM
Length	345
Function	Transcriptional regulator that binds the cAMP response element (CRE), a sequence present in many viral and cellular promoters. Isoforms are either transcriptional activators or repressors. Plays a role in spermatogenesis and is involved in spermatid maturation (PubMed:10373550).
