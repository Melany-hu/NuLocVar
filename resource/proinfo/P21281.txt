UniprotID	P21281
Accession	P21281;B2R5Z3;D3DSQ5;Q14544;Q15859;Q96IR0
EntryName	VATB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit B, brain isoform (V-ATPase subunit B 2) (Endomembrane proton pump 58 kDa subunit) (HO57) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit B 2)
GeneName	ATP6V1B2 ATP6B2 VPP3
Length	511
Function	Non-catalytic subunit of the V1 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons (PubMed:33065002). V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment (PubMed:32001091). In renal intercalated cells, can partially compensate the lack of ATP6V1B1 and mediate secretion of protons (H+) into the urine under base-line conditions but not in conditions of acid load (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane; Melanosome; Cytoplasm; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane
