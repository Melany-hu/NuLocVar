UniprotID	P13727
Accession	P13727;A6XMW0;B2R5I1;P81448;Q14227;Q6ICT2
EntryName	PRG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bone marrow proteoglycan (BMPG) (Proteoglycan 2) [Cleaved into: Eosinophil granule major basic protein (EMBP) (MBP) (Pregnancy-associated major basic protein)]
GeneName	PRG2 MBP
Length	222
Function	Cytotoxin and helminthotoxin. Also induces non-cytolytic histamine release from human basophils. Involved in antiparasitic defense mechanisms and immune hypersensitivity reactions. The proform acts as a proteinase inhibitor, reducing the activity of PAPPA.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle
