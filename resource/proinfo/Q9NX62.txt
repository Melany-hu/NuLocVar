UniprotID	Q9NX62
Accession	Q9NX62;Q6NVY7
EntryName	IMPA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Golgi-resident adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate 3'-phosphatase (Golgi-resident PAP phosphatase) (gPAPP) (EC 3.1.3.7) (3'(2'), 5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase 2) (Inositol monophosphatase domain-containing protein 1) (Myo-inositol monophosphatase A3) (Phosphoadenosine phosphate 3'-nucleotidase)
GeneName	BPNT2 IMPA3 IMPAD1
Length	359
Function	Exhibits 3'-nucleotidase activity toward adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate (PAP), namely hydrolyzes adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate into adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and a phosphate. May play a role in the formation of skeletal elements derived through endochondral ossification, possibly by clearing adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate produced by Golgi sulfotransferases during glycosaminoglycan sulfation. Has no activity toward 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) or inositol phosphate (IP) substrates including I(1)P, I(1,4)P2, I(1,3,4)P3, I(1,4,5)P3 and I(1,3,4,5)P4.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane
