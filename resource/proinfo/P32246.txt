UniprotID	P32246
Accession	P32246;Q86VA9
EntryName	CCR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C chemokine receptor type 1 (C-C CKR-1) (CC-CKR-1) (CCR-1) (CCR1) (HM145) (LD78 receptor) (Macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha receptor) (MIP-1alpha-R) (RANTES-R) (CD antigen CD191)
GeneName	CCR1 CMKBR1 CMKR1 SCYAR1
Length	355
Function	Chemokine receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating immune cell migration, inflammation, and immune responses (PubMed:14991608). Contributes to the inflammatory response by recruiting immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, T-cells, and dendritic cells, to sites of inflammation for the clearance of pathogens and the resolution of tissue damage. When activated by its ligands including CCL3, CCL5-9, CCL13-16 and CCL23, triggers a signaling cascade within immune cells, leading to their migration towards the source of the chemokine (PubMed:15905581). For example, mediates neutrophil migration after activation by CCL3 leading to the sequential release of TNF-alpha and leukotriene B4 (By similarity). Also mediates monocyte migration upon CXCL4 binding (PubMed:29930254). Activation by CCL5 results in neuroinflammation through the ERK1/2 signaling pathway (By similarity).
