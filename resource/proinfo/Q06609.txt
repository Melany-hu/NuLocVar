EntryName	RAD51_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA repair protein RAD51 homolog 1 (HsRAD51) (hRAD51) (RAD51 homolog A)
GeneName	RAD51 RAD51A RECA
Length	339
Function	Plays an important role in homologous strand exchange, a key step in DNA repair through homologous recombination (HR) (PubMed:12205100, PubMed:18417535, PubMed:20231364, PubMed:20348101, PubMed:22325354, PubMed:23509288, PubMed:23754376, PubMed:26681308, PubMed:28575658, PubMed:32640219). Binds to single-stranded DNA in an ATP-dependent manner to form nucleoprotein filaments which are essential for the homology search and strand exchange (PubMed:12205100, PubMed:18417535, PubMed:20231364, PubMed:20348101, PubMed:23509288, PubMed:23754376, PubMed:26681308, PubMed:28575658). Catalyzes the recognition of homology and strand exchange between homologous DNA partners to form a joint molecule between a processed DNA break and the repair template (PubMed:12205100, PubMed:18417535, PubMed:20231364, PubMed:20348101, PubMed:23509288, PubMed:23754376, PubMed:26681308, PubMed:28575658, PubMed:38459011). Recruited to resolve stalled replication forks during replication stress (PubMed:27797818, PubMed:31844045). Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing BRCA2 and RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR (PubMed:12442171, PubMed:24141787). Plays a role in regulating mitochondrial DNA copy number under conditions of oxidative stress in the presence of RAD51C and XRCC3 (PubMed:20413593). Also involved in interstrand cross-link repair (PubMed:26253028).
