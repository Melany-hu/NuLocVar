UniprotID	P18509
Accession	P18509;B2R7N4;Q52LQ0
EntryName	PACA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) [Cleaved into: PACAP-related peptide (PRP-48); Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 27 (PACAP-27) (PACAP27); Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 38 (PACAP-38) (PACAP38)]
GeneName	ADCYAP1
Length	176
Function	PACAP is a neuropeptide involved in diverse array of physiological processes through activating the PACAP subfamily of class B1 G protein-coupled receptors: VIP receptor 1 (VIPR1), VIP receptor 2 (VIPR2), and PACAP type I receptor (ADCYAP1R1) (PubMed:11175907, PubMed:23800469, PubMed:32047270, PubMed:36385145). Exerts neuroprotective and general cytoprotective effects due to anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant actions (PubMed:23800469). Promotes neuron projection development through the RAPGEF2/Rap1/B-Raf/ERK pathway (PubMed:23800469). In chromaffin cells, induces long-lasting increase of intracellular calcium concentrations and neuroendocrine secretion (By similarity). Involved in the control of glucose homeostasis, induces insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells (By similarity). PACAP exists in two bioactive forms from proteolysis of the same precursor protein, PACAP27 and PACAP38, which differ by eleven amino acid residues in the C-terminus (PubMed:32047270).
