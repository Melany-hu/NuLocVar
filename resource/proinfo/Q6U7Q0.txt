UniprotID	Q6U7Q0
Accession	Q6U7Q0;A8K1X3;Q0VDH6;Q6B0G2;Q86W72;Q9H5I9
EntryName	ZN322_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein 322 (Zinc finger protein 322A) (Zinc finger protein 388) (Zinc finger protein 489)
GeneName	ZNF322 ZNF322A ZNF388 ZNF489
Length	402
Function	Transcriptional activator (PubMed:15555580). Important for maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (By similarity). Binds directly to the POU5F1 distal enhancer and the NANOG proximal promoter, and enhances expression of both genes (By similarity). Can also bind to numerous other gene promoters and regulates expression of many other pluripotency factors, either directly or indirectly (By similarity). Promotes inhibition of MAPK signaling during embryonic stem cell differentiation (By similarity).
