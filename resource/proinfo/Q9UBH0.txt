UniprotID	Q9UBH0
Accession	Q9UBH0;A8K2I4;Q56AT9;Q7RTZ6
EntryName	I36RA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-36 receptor antagonist protein (IL-36Ra) (FIL1 delta) (IL-1-related protein 3) (IL-1RP3) (Interleukin-1 HY1) (IL-1HY1) (Interleukin-1 delta) (IL-1 delta) (Interleukin-1 family member 5) (IL-1F5) (Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist homolog 1) (IL-1ra homolog 1) (Interleukin-1-like protein 1) (IL-1L1)
GeneName	IL36RN FIL1D IL1F5 IL1HY1 IL1L1 IL1RP3 UNQ1896/PRO4342
Length	155
Function	Inhibits the activity of interleukin-36 (IL36A,IL36B and IL36G) by binding to receptor IL1RL2 and preventing its association with the coreceptor IL1RAP for signaling. Part of the IL-36 signaling system that is thought to be present in epithelial barriers and to take part in local inflammatory response; similar to the IL-1 system with which it shares the coreceptor. Proposed to play a role in skin inflammation. May be involved in the innate immune response to fungal pathogens, such as Aspergillus fumigatus. May activate an anti-inflammatory signaling pathway by recruiting SIGIRR.
