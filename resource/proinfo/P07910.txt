EntryName	HNRPC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C1/C2 (hnRNP C1/C2)
GeneName	HNRNPC HNRPC
Length	306
Function	Binds pre-mRNA and nucleates the assembly of 40S hnRNP particles (PubMed:8264621). Interacts with poly-U tracts in the 3'-UTR or 5'-UTR of mRNA and modulates the stability and the level of translation of bound mRNA molecules (PubMed:12509468, PubMed:16010978, PubMed:7567451, PubMed:8264621). Single HNRNPC tetramers bind 230-240 nucleotides. Trimers of HNRNPC tetramers bind 700 nucleotides (PubMed:8264621). May play a role in the early steps of spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been shown to alter the local structure in mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) via a mechanism named 'm(6)A-switch', facilitating binding of HNRNPC, leading to regulation of mRNA splicing (PubMed:25719671).
