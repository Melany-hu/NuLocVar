UniprotID	P16455
Accession	P16455;Q5VY78
EntryName	MGMT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.63) (6-O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) (MGMT) (O-6-methylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase)
GeneName	MGMT
Length	207
Function	Involved in the cellular defense against the biological effects of O6-methylguanine (O6-MeG) and O4-methylthymine (O4-MeT) in DNA. Repairs the methylated nucleobase in DNA by stoichiometrically transferring the methyl group to a cysteine residue in the enzyme. This is a suicide reaction: the enzyme is irreversibly inactivated.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
