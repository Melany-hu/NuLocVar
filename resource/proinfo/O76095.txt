UniprotID	O76095
Accession	O76095;O95442;Q6IB19;Q9P0Q4
EntryName	JTB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein JTB (Jumping translocation breakpoint protein) (Prostate androgen-regulated protein) (PAR protein)
GeneName	JTB HSPC222
Length	146
Function	Required for normal cytokinesis during mitosis. Plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation. May be a component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), a complex that acts as a key regulator of mitosis. The CPC complex has essential functions at the centromere in ensuring correct chromosome alignment and segregation and is required for chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle assembly. Increases AURKB activity. Inhibits apoptosis induced by TGFB1 (By similarity). Overexpression induces swelling of mitochondria and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential (By similarity).
