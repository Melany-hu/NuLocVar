UniprotID	Q9BUM1
Accession	Q9BUM1;Q8WU15
EntryName	G6PC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucose-6-phosphatase 3 (G-6-Pase 3) (G6Pase 3) (EC 3.1.3.9) (Glucose-6-phosphatase beta) (G6Pase-beta) (Ubiquitous glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein)
GeneName	G6PC3 UGRP
Length	346
Function	Hydrolyzes glucose-6-phosphate to glucose in the endoplasmic reticulum. May form with the glucose-6-phosphate transporter (SLC37A4/G6PT) a ubiquitously expressed complex responsible for glucose production through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Probably required for normal neutrophil function.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
