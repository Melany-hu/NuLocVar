ProteinName	Heparan sulfate glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1 (EC 2.8.2.30) (Heparan sulfate D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1) (3-OST-3B) (Heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1) (h3-OST-3B)
GeneName	HS3ST3B1 3OST3B1 HS3ST3B
Length	390
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) to catalyze the transfer of a sulfo group to an N-unsubstituted glucosamine linked to a 2-O-sulfo iduronic acid unit on heparan sulfate (PubMed:10520990, PubMed:9988768). Catalyzes the O-sulfation of glucosamine in IdoUA2S-GlcNS and also in IdoUA2S-GlcNH2 (PubMed:10520990, PubMed:9988768). The substrate-specific O-sulfation generates an enzyme-modified heparan sulfate which acts as a binding receptor to Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and permits its entry (PubMed:10520990). Unlike HS3ST1/3-OST-1, does not convert non-anticoagulant heparan sulfate to anticoagulant heparan sulfate (PubMed:9988768).
