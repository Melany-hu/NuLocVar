EntryName	ZP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 3 (Sperm receptor) (ZP3A/ZP3B) (Zona pellucida glycoprotein 3) (Zp-3) (Zona pellucida protein C) [Cleaved into: Processed zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 3]
GeneName	ZP3 ZP3A ZP3B ZPC
Length	424
Function	Component of the zona pellucida, an extracellular matrix surrounding oocytes which mediates sperm binding, induction of the acrosome reaction and prevents post-fertilization polyspermy. The zona pellucida is composed of 3 to 4 glycoproteins, ZP1, ZP2, ZP3, and ZP4. ZP3 is essential for sperm binding and zona matrix formation.
Subcellular Location	Zona pellucida; Cell membrane
