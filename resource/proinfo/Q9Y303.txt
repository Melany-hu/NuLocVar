UniprotID	Q9Y303
Accession	Q9Y303;B4DL77;Q8WV54
EntryName	NAGA_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase (GlcNAc 6-P deacetylase) (EC 3.5.1.25) (Amidohydrolase domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	AMDHD2 CGI-14
Length	409
Function	Hydrolyzes the N-glycolyl group from N-glycolylglucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcNGc-6-P) in the N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) degradation pathway. Although human is not able to catalyze formation of Neu5Gc due to the inactive CMAHP enzyme, Neu5Gc is present in food and must be degraded.
