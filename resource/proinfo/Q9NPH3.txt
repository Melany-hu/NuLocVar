UniprotID	Q9NPH3
Accession	Q9NPH3;B1NLD0;D3DNW0;O14915;Q86WJ7
EntryName	IL1AP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1 receptor accessory protein) (IL-1RAcP) (EC 3.2.2.6) (Interleukin-1 receptor 3) (IL-1R-3) (IL-1R3)
GeneName	IL1RAP C3orf13 IL1R3
Length	570
Function	Coreceptor for IL1RL2 in the IL-36 signaling system (By similarity). Coreceptor with IL1R1 in the IL-1 signaling system. Associates with IL1R1 bound to IL1B to form the high affinity interleukin-1 receptor complex which mediates interleukin-1-dependent activation of NF-kappa-B and other pathways. Signaling involves the recruitment of adapter molecules such as TOLLIP, MYD88, and IRAK1 or IRAK2 via the respective TIR domains of the receptor/coreceptor subunits. Recruits TOLLIP to the signaling complex. Does not bind to interleukin-1 alone; binding of IL1RN to IL1R1, prevents its association with IL1R1 to form a signaling complex. The cellular response is modulated through a non-signaling association with the membrane IL1R2 decoy receptor. Coreceptor for IL1RL1 in the IL-33 signaling system. Can bidirectionally induce pre- and postsynaptic differentiation of neurons by trans-synaptically binding to PTPRD (By similarity). May play a role in IL1B-mediated costimulation of IFNG production from T-helper 1 (Th1) cells (Probable).
