UniprotID	Q9UKS6
Accession	Q9UKS6;A6NH84;Q9H331;Q9NWV9
EntryName	PACN3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons protein 3 (SH3 domain-containing protein 6511)
GeneName	PACSIN3
Length	424
Function	Plays a role in endocytosis and regulates internalization of plasma membrane proteins. Overexpression impairs internalization of SLC2A1/GLUT1 and TRPV4 and increases the levels of SLC2A1/GLUT1 and TRPV4 at the cell membrane. Inhibits the TRPV4 calcium channel activity (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cell membrane
