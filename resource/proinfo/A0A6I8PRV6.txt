UniprotID	A0A6I8PRV6
Accession	A0A6I8PRV6
EntryName	A0A6I8PRV6_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-actin-capping protein subunit beta
GeneName	CAPZB
Length	59
Function	F-actin-capping proteins bind in a Ca(2+)-independent manner to the fast growing ends of actin filaments (barbed end) thereby blocking the exchange of subunits at these ends. Unlike other capping proteins (such as gelsolin and severin), these proteins do not sever actin filaments. Plays a role in the regulation of cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization. Forms, with CAPZB, the barbed end of the fast growing ends of actin filaments in the dynactin complex and stabilizes dynactin structure. The dynactin multiprotein complex activates the molecular motor dynein for ultra-processive transport along microtubules.
