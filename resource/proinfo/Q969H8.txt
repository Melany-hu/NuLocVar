UniprotID	Q969H8
Accession	Q969H8;D6W628;O75256;O75272;Q9BTK7;Q9NP69
EntryName	MYDGF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myeloid-derived growth factor (MYDGF)
GeneName	MYDGF C19orf10
Length	173
Function	Bone marrow-derived monocyte and paracrine-acting protein that promotes cardiac myocyte survival and adaptive angiogenesis for cardiac protection and/or repair after myocardial infarction (MI). Stimulates endothelial cell proliferation through a MAPK1/3-, STAT3- and CCND1-mediated signaling pathway. Inhibits cardiac myocyte apoptosis in a PI3K/AKT-dependent signaling pathway (By similarity). Involved in endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis (PubMed:25581518).
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment; Endoplasmic reticulum; Golgi apparatus
