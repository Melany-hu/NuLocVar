UniprotID	Q96I25
Accession	Q96I25;Q96GY6
EntryName	SPF45_HUMAN
ProteinName	Splicing factor 45 (45 kDa-splicing factor) (RNA-binding motif protein 17)
GeneName	RBM17 SPF45
Length	401
Function	Splice factor that binds to the single-stranded 3'AG at the exon/intron border and promotes its utilization in the second catalytic step. Involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and the utilization of cryptic splice sites. Promotes the utilization of a cryptic splice site created by the beta-110 mutation in the HBB gene. The resulting frameshift leads to sickle cell anemia.
