UniprotID	Q13162
Accession	Q13162;Q6FHT3
EntryName	PRDX4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxiredoxin-4 (EC 1.11.1.24) (Antioxidant enzyme AOE372) (AOE37-2) (Peroxiredoxin IV) (Prx-IV) (Thioredoxin peroxidase AO372) (Thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase A0372) (Thioredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxin 4)
GeneName	PRDX4
Length	271
Function	Thiol-specific peroxidase that catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water and alcohols, respectively. Plays a role in cell protection against oxidative stress by detoxifying peroxides and as sensor of hydrogen peroxide-mediated signaling events. Regulates the activation of NF-kappa-B in the cytosol by a modulation of I-kappa-B-alpha phosphorylation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Endoplasmic reticulum
