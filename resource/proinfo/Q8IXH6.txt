UniprotID	Q8IXH6
Accession	Q8IXH6;A8K8S8;E1P5P6;Q5JX64;Q8IYL5;Q9NU00
EntryName	T53I2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor protein p53-inducible nuclear protein 2 (Diabetes and obesity-regulated gene) (p53-inducible protein U) (PIG-U)
GeneName	TP53INP2 C20orf110 DOR PINH
Length	220
Function	Dual regulator of transcription and autophagy. Positively regulates autophagy and is required for autophagosome formation and processing. May act as a scaffold protein that recruits MAP1LC3A, GABARAP and GABARAPL2 and brings them to the autophagosome membrane by interacting with VMP1 where, in cooperation with the BECN1-PI3-kinase class III complex, they trigger autophagosome development. Acts as a transcriptional activator of THRA.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Nucleus; Nucleus; PML body; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome
