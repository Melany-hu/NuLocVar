UniprotID	Q6HA08
Accession	Q6HA08;Q3KNT0
EntryName	ASTL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Astacin-like metalloendopeptidase (EC 3.4.-.-) (Oocyte astacin) (Ovastacin) (ZP2-proteinase)
GeneName	ASTL
Length	431
Function	Oocyte-specific oolemmal receptor involved in sperm and egg adhesion and fertilization. Plays a role in the polyspermy inhibition. Probably acts as a protease for the post-fertilization cleavage of ZP2. Cleaves the sperm-binding ZP2 at the surface of the zona pellucida after fertilization and cortical granule exocytosis, rendering the zona pellucida unable to support further sperm binding.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Cortical granule
