UniprotID	Q9H3P2
Accession	Q9H3P2;A2A2T1;O95392
EntryName	NELFA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Negative elongation factor A (NELF-A) (Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 2 protein)
GeneName	NELFA WHSC2 P/OKcl.15
Length	528
Function	Essential component of the NELF complex, a complex that negatively regulates the elongation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The NELF complex, which acts via an association with the DSIF complex and causes transcriptional pausing, is counteracted by the P-TEFb kinase complex.
