UniprotID	Q6VUC0
Accession	Q6VUC0;Q8IW12
EntryName	AP2E_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor AP-2-epsilon (AP2-epsilon) (Activating enhancer-binding protein 2-epsilon)
GeneName	TFAP2E
Length	442
Function	Sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that interacts with inducible viral and cellular enhancer elements to regulate transcription of selected genes. AP-2 factors bind to the consensus sequence 5'-GCCNNNGGC-3' and activate genes involved in a large spectrum of important biological functions including proper eye, face, body wall, limb and neural tube development. They also suppress a number of genes including MCAM/MUC18, C/EBP alpha and MYC. AP-2-epsilon may play a role in the development of the CNS and in cartilage differentiation (By similarity).
