UniprotID	P12277
Accession	P12277;A8K236;B2R5R4;Q2LE07;Q6FG40;Q9UC66
EntryName	KCRB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Creatine kinase B-type (EC 2.7.3.2) (Brain creatine kinase) (B-CK) (Creatine kinase B chain) (Creatine phosphokinase B-type) (CPK-B)
GeneName	CKB CKBB
Length	381
Function	Reversibly catalyzes the transfer of phosphate between ATP and various phosphogens (e.g. creatine phosphate) (PubMed:8186255). Creatine kinase isoenzymes play a central role in energy transduction in tissues with large, fluctuating energy demands, such as skeletal muscle, heart, brain and spermatozoa (Probable). Acts as a key regulator of adaptive thermogenesis as part of the futile creatine cycle: localizes to the mitochondria of thermogenic fat cells and acts by mediating phosphorylation of creatine to initiate a futile cycle of creatine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (By similarity). During the futile creatine cycle, creatine and N-phosphocreatine are in a futile cycle, which dissipates the high energy charge of N-phosphocreatine as heat without performing any mechanical or chemical work (By similarity).
