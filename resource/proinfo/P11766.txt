UniprotID	P11766
Accession	P11766;Q6FHR2
EntryName	ADHX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alcohol dehydrogenase class-3 (EC 1.1.1.1) (Alcohol dehydrogenase 5) (Alcohol dehydrogenase class chi chain) (Alcohol dehydrogenase class-III) (Glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase) (FALDH) (FDH) (GSH-FDH) (EC 1.1.1.-) (S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase) (EC 1.1.1.284)
GeneName	ADH5 ADHX FDH
Length	374
Function	Catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain primary alcohols and the oxidation of S-(hydroxymethyl) glutathione (PubMed:8460164). Also oxidizes long chain omega-hydroxy fatty acids, such as 20-HETE, producing both the intermediate aldehyde, 20-oxoarachidonate and the end product, a dicarboxylic acid, (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenedioate (PubMed:16081420). Class-III ADH is remarkably ineffective in oxidizing ethanol (PubMed:8460164). Required for clearance of cellular formaldehyde, a cytotoxic and carcinogenic metabolite that induces DNA damage (PubMed:33355142). Also acts as a S-nitroso-glutathione reductase by catalyzing the NADH-dependent reduction of S-nitrosoglutathione, thereby regulating protein S-nitrosylation (By similarity).
