Length	779
Function	Regulates the translocation of phosphorylated SRC to peripheral cell-matrix adhesion sites. Required for proper architecture of actin filaments. Plays a role in coupling actin fibers to cell junctions in endothelial cells and is therefore required for correct endothelial cell morphology via facilitating transcellular transmission of mechanical force resulting in endothelial cell elongation (By similarity). Required for the anchoring of radial actin fibers to CDH1 junction complexes at the cell membrane which facilitates organization of radial actin fiber structure and cellular response to contractile forces (PubMed:28842668). This contributes to maintenance of cell area, size, shape, epithelial sheet organization and trophectoderm cell properties that facilitate blastocyst zona hatching (PubMed:28842668). Inhibits the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, probably by recruiting CTNNB1 to recycling endosomes and hence preventing its translocation to the nucleus. Participates in angiogenesis. Activates the Hippo signaling pathway in response to cell contact inhibition via interaction with and ubiquitination by Crumbs complex-bound WWP1 (PubMed:34404733). Ubiquitinated AMOTL2 then interacts with LATS2 which in turn phosphorylates YAP1, excluding it from the nucleus and localizing it to the cytoplasm and tight junctions, therefore ultimately repressing YAP1-driven transcription of target genes (PubMed:17293535, PubMed:21205866, PubMed:26598551). Acts to inhibit WWTR1/TAZ transcriptional coactivator activity via sequestering WWTR1/TAZ in the cytoplasm and at tight junctions (PubMed:23911299). Regulates the size and protein composition of the podosome cortex and core at myofibril neuromuscular junctions (PubMed:23525008). Selectively promotes FGF-induced MAPK activation through SRC (PubMed:17293535). May play a role in the polarity, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells.
