UniprotID	Q8WWZ1
Accession	Q8WWZ1;Q53SR9;Q56AT8;Q7RTZ5;Q969H5;Q9BYX1
EntryName	IL1FA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-1 family member 10 (IL-1F10) (Family of interleukin 1-theta) (FIL1 theta) (Interleukin-1 HY2) (IL-1HY2) (Interleukin-1 theta) (IL-1 theta) (Interleukin-38) (IL-38)
GeneName	IL1F10 FIL1T IL1HY2 IL38 FKSG75 UNQ6119/PRO20041
Length	152
Function	Cytokine with immunomodulatory activity. Alone, does not induce cytokine production, but reduces IL22 and IL17A production by T-cells in response to heat-killed Candida albicans. Reduces IL36G-induced production of IL8 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Increases IL6 production by dendritic cells stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Ligand for IL-36R/IL1RL2.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Secreted
