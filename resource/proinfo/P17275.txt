UniprotID	P17275
Accession	P17275;Q96GH3
EntryName	JUNB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor JunB (Transcription factor AP-1 subunit JunB)
GeneName	JUNB
Length	347
Function	Transcription factor involved in regulating gene activity following the primary growth factor response. Binds to the DNA sequence 5'-TGATCA-3'. Heterodimerizes with proteins of the FOS family to form an AP-1 transcription complex, thereby enhancing its DNA binding activity to an AP-1 consensus sequence and its transcriptional activity (By similarity).
