EntryName	5HT1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (5-HT-1B) (5-HT1B) (S12) (Serotonin 1D beta receptor) (5-HT-1D-beta) (Serotonin receptor 1B)
GeneName	HTR1B HTR1DB
Length	390
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (PubMed:10452531, PubMed:1315531, PubMed:1328844, PubMed:1348246, PubMed:1351684, PubMed:1559993, PubMed:1565658, PubMed:1610347, PubMed:23519210, PubMed:23519215, PubMed:29925951, PubMed:8218242). Also functions as a receptor for ergot alkaloid derivatives, various anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs and other psychoactive substances, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (PubMed:23519210, PubMed:23519215, PubMed:29925951). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase (PubMed:10452531, PubMed:1315531, PubMed:1328844, PubMed:1348246, PubMed:1351684, PubMed:1559993, PubMed:1565658, PubMed:1610347, PubMed:23519210, PubMed:23519215, PubMed:29925951, PubMed:8218242). HTR1B is coupled to G(i)/G(o) G alpha proteins and mediates inhibitory neurotransmission by inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity (PubMed:29925951, PubMed:35610220). Arrestin family members inhibit signaling via G proteins and mediate activation of alternative signaling pathways (PubMed:29925951). Regulates the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine and acetylcholine in the brain, and thereby affects neural activity, nociceptive processing, pain perception, mood and behavior (PubMed:18476671, PubMed:20945968). Besides, plays a role in vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries (PubMed:15853772).
