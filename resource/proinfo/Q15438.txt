UniprotID	Q15438
Accession	Q15438;A6NFW7;B7Z1T4;Q9P123;Q9P124
EntryName	CYH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytohesin-1 (PH, SEC7 and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1) (SEC7 homolog B2-1)
GeneName	CYTH1 D17S811E PSCD1
Length	398
Function	Promotes guanine-nucleotide exchange on ARF1, ARF5 and ARF6. Promotes the activation of ARF factors through replacement of GDP with GTP. Plays an important role in membrane trafficking, during junctional remodeling and epithelial polarization, through regulation of ARF6 activity.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Cell junction; Tight junction; Cell junction; Adherens junction
