UniprotID	P57052
Accession	P57052;Q6YNC2;Q8NBA1;Q8NFF6
EntryName	RBM11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Splicing regulator RBM11 (RNA-binding motif protein 11)
GeneName	RBM11
Length	281
Function	Tissue-specific splicing factor with potential implication in the regulation of alternative splicing during neuron and germ cell differentiation. Antagonizes SRSF1-mediated BCL-X splicing. May affect the choice of alternative 5' splice sites by binding to specific sequences in exons and antagonizing the SR protein SRSF1.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleoplasm; Nucleus speckle
