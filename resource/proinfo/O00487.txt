UniprotID	O00487
Accession	O00487;B3KNW2;O00176
EntryName	PSDE_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 14 (EC 3.4.19.-) (26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN11) (26S proteasome-associated PAD1 homolog 1)
GeneName	PSMD14 POH1
Length	310
Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair. The PSMD14 subunit is a metalloprotease that specifically cleaves 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains within the complex. Plays a role in response to double-strand breaks (DSBs): acts as a regulator of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) by cleaving 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin, thereby promoting retention of JMJD2A/KDM4A on chromatin and restricting TP53BP1 accumulation. Also involved in homologous recombination repair by promoting RAD51 loading.
