UniprotID	P31371
Accession	P31371;A8K427;Q3SY32
EntryName	FGF9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF-9) (Glia-activating factor) (GAF) (Heparin-binding growth factor 9) (HBGF-9)
GeneName	FGF9
Length	208
Function	Plays an important role in the regulation of embryonic development, cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell migration. May have a role in glial cell growth and differentiation during development, gliosis during repair and regeneration of brain tissue after damage, differentiation and survival of neuronal cells, and growth stimulation of glial tumors.
