UniprotID	Q15528
Accession	Q15528;B3KW83;B3KWX4;O76072;Q5T8U0
EntryName	MED22_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 22 (Mediator complex subunit 22) (Surfeit locus protein 5) (Surf-5)
GeneName	MED22 SURF5
Length	200
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
