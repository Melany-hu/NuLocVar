UniprotID	Q8N8N7
Accession	Q8N8N7;Q3L8A4;Q6MZH8
EntryName	PTGR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostaglandin reductase 2 (PRG-2) (EC 1.3.1.48) (15-oxoprostaglandin 13-reductase) (Zinc-binding alcohol dehydrogenase domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	PTGR2 ZADH1
Length	351
Function	Functions as 15-oxo-prostaglandin 13-reductase and acts on 15-keto-PGE1, 15-keto-PGE2, 15-keto-PGE1-alpha and 15-keto-PGE2-alpha with highest activity towards 15-keto-PGE2 (PubMed:19000823). Overexpression represses transcriptional activity of PPARG and inhibits adipocyte differentiation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
