UniprotID	O43623
Accession	O43623;B2R6P6;Q53FC1
EntryName	SNAI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein SNAI2 (Neural crest transcription factor Slug) (Protein snail homolog 2)
GeneName	SNAI2 SLUG SLUGH
Length	268
Function	Transcriptional repressor that modulates both activator-dependent and basal transcription. Involved in the generation and migration of neural crest cells. Plays a role in mediating RAF1-induced transcriptional repression of the TJ protein, occludin (OCLN) and subsequent oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells (By similarity). Represses BRCA2 expression by binding to its E2-box-containing silencer and recruiting CTBP1 and HDAC1 in breast cells. In epidermal keratinocytes, binds to the E-box in ITGA3 promoter and represses its transcription. Involved in the regulation of ITGB1 and ITGB4 expression and cell adhesion and proliferation in epidermal keratinocytes. Binds to E-box2 domain of BSG and activates its expression during TGFB1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocytes. Represses E-Cadherin/CDH1 transcription via E-box elements. Involved in osteoblast maturation. Binds to RUNX2 and SOC9 promoters and may act as a positive and negative transcription regulator, respectively, in osteoblasts. Binds to CXCL12 promoter via E-box regions in mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts. Plays an essential role in TWIST1-induced EMT and its ability to promote invasion and metastasis.
