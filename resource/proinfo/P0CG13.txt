UniprotID	P0CG13
Accession	P0CG13;A8MYX8;Q71E72;Q8NDH8;Q8WV66;Q9NX73
EntryName	CTF8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chromosome transmission fidelity protein 8 homolog (hCTF8)
GeneName	CHTF8 CTF8
Length	121
Function	Chromosome cohesion factor involved in sister chromatid cohesion and fidelity of chromosome transmission. Component of one of the cell nuclear antigen loader complexes, CTF18-replication factor C (CTF18-RFC), which consists of CTF18, CTF8, DSCC1, RFC2, RFC3, RFC4 and RFC5. The CTF18-RFC complex binds to single-stranded and primed DNAs and has weak ATPase activity that is stimulated the presence of primed DNA, replication protein A (RPA) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The CTF18-RFC complex catalyzes the ATP-dependent loading of PCNA onto primed and gapped DNA. It also interacts with and stimulates POLH, which is suggestive of a protein network that coordinates DNA repair, recombination and chromosome cohesion reactions with replication fork progression.
