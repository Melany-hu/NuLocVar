EntryName	MLX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Max-like protein X (Class D basic helix-loop-helix protein 13) (bHLHd13) (Max-like bHLHZip protein) (Protein BigMax) (Transcription factor-like protein 4)
GeneName	MLX BHLHD13 TCFL4
Length	298
Function	Transcription regulator. Forms a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein complex with MAD1, MAD4, MNT, WBSCR14 and MLXIP which recognizes the core sequence 5'-CACGTG-3'. The TCFL4-MAD1, TCFL4-MAD4, TCFL4-WBSCR14 complexes are transcriptional repressors. Plays a role in transcriptional activation of glycolytic target genes. Involved in glucose-responsive gene regulation.
