EntryName	NELFD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Negative elongation factor C/D (NELF-C/D) (TH1-like protein)
GeneName	NELFCD NELFD TH1 TH1L HSPC130
Length	590
Function	Essential component of the NELF complex, a complex that negatively regulates the elongation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (PubMed:12612062). The NELF complex, which acts via an association with the DSIF complex and causes transcriptional pausing, is counteracted by the P-TEFb kinase complex (PubMed:10199401).
