UniprotID	P04798
Accession	P04798;A4F3V9;A4F3W0;Q53G18
EntryName	CP1A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYPIA1) (EC 1.14.14.1) (Cytochrome P450 form 6) (Cytochrome P450-C) (Cytochrome P450-P1) (Hydroperoxy icosatetraenoate dehydratase) (EC 4.2.1.152)
GeneName	CYP1A1
Length	512
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids, steroid hormones and vitamins (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15041462, PubMed:15805301, PubMed:18577768, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15041462, PubMed:15805301, PubMed:18577768, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Exhibits high catalytic activity for the formation of hydroxyestrogens from estrone (E1) and 17beta-estradiol (E2), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2, as well as D-ring hydroxylated E1 and E2 at the C15-alpha and C16-alpha positions (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15805301). Displays different regioselectivities for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) hydroxylation (PubMed:15041462, PubMed:18577768). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of certain PUFA (PubMed:15041462, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Converts arachidonic acid toward epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) regioisomers, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET, that function as lipid mediators in the vascular system (PubMed:20972997). Displays an absolute stereoselectivity in the epoxidation of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) producing the 17(R),18(S) enantiomer (PubMed:15041462). May play an important role in all-trans retinoic acid biosynthesis in extrahepatic tissues. Catalyzes two successive oxidative transformation of all-trans retinol to all-trans retinal and then to the active form all-trans retinoic acid (PubMed:10681376). May also participate in eicosanoids metabolism by converting hydroperoxide species into oxo metabolites (lipoxygenase-like reaction, NADPH-independent) (PubMed:21068195).
