EntryName	RGS6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 6 (RGS6) (S914)
GeneName	RGS6
Length	472
Function	Regulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades. Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits, thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form. The RGS6/GNB5 dimer enhances GNAO1 GTPase activity (PubMed:10521509).
