UniprotID	Q9H6F2
Accession	Q9H6F2;A8K9P9
EntryName	TM38A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trimeric intracellular cation channel type A (TRIC-A) (TRICA) (Transmembrane protein 38A)
GeneName	TMEM38A TRICA
Length	299
Function	Intracellular monovalent cation channel required for maintenance of rapid intracellular calcium release. Acts as a potassium counter-ion channel that functions in synchronization with calcium release from intracellular stores (By similarity). Opened by a change of voltage within the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane; Nucleus membrane
