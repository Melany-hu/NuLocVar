EntryName	TM175_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endosomal/lysosomal proton channel TMEM175 (Potassium channel TMEM175) (Transmembrane protein 175) (hTMEM175)
GeneName	TMEM175
Length	504
Function	Proton-activated proton channel that catalyzes proton efflux from endosomes and lysosomes to maintain a steady-state pH (PubMed:35333573, PubMed:35750034, PubMed:37390818). Activated at low pH (under pH 4.6) by luminal side protons: selectively mediates lysosomal proton release from lysosomes, eliciting a proton leak that balances V-ATPase activity to maintain pH homeostasis (PubMed:35750034). Regulation of lumenal pH stability is required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion (PubMed:26317472, PubMed:32267231). Also acts as a potassium channel at higher pH, regulating potassium conductance in endosomes and lysosomes (PubMed:26317472, PubMed:28723891, PubMed:32228865, PubMed:32267231, PubMed:33505021). Constitutes the pore-forming subunit of the lysoK(GF) complex, a complex activated by extracellular growth factors (PubMed:33505021). The lysoK(GF) complex is composed of TMEM175 and AKT (AKT1, AKT2 or AKT3), a major target of growth factor receptors: in the complex, TMEM175 channel is opened by conformational changes by AKT, leading to its activation (PubMed:33505021). The lysoK(GF) complex is required to protect neurons against stress-induced damage (PubMed:33505021).
