UniprotID	Q9HAV7
Accession	Q9HAV7;B2R783;Q549M6
EntryName	GRPE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	GrpE protein homolog 1, mitochondrial (HMGE) (Mt-GrpE#1)
GeneName	GRPEL1 GREPEL1
Length	217
Function	Essential component of the PAM complex, a complex required for the translocation of transit peptide-containing proteins from the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix in an ATP-dependent manner (By similarity). Seems to control the nucleotide-dependent binding of mitochondrial HSP70 to substrate proteins (PubMed:11311562).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
