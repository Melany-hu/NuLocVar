UniprotID	Q969Q6
Accession	Q969Q6;B4DEN7;D3DS97;D3DS98;Q5GJ55;Q5GJ56;Q6P4G2;Q86TZ3;Q9NWR9
EntryName	P2R3C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B'' subunit gamma (Protein phosphatase subunit G5PR) (Rhabdomyosarcoma antigen MU-RMS-40.6A/6C)
GeneName	PPP2R3C C14orf10 G5PR
Length	453
Function	May regulate MCM3AP phosphorylation through phosphatase recruitment (By similarity). May act as a negative regulator of ABCB1 expression and function through the dephosphorylation of ABCB1 by TFPI2/PPP2R3C complex (PubMed:24333728). May play a role in the activation-induced cell death of B-cells (By similarity).
