Accession	P30281;B2RD63;B3KQ22;E9PAS4;E9PB36;Q5T8J0;Q6FG62;Q96F49
EntryName	CCND3_HUMAN
ProteinName	G1/S-specific cyclin-D3
GeneName	CCND3
Length	96
Function	Regulatory component of the cyclin D3-CDK4 (DC) complex that phosphorylates and inhibits members of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family including RB1 and regulates the cell-cycle during G(1)/S transition (PubMed:8114739). Phosphorylation of RB1 allows dissociation of the transcription factor E2F from the RB/E2F complex and the subsequent transcription of E2F target genes which are responsible for the progression through the G(1) phase (PubMed:8114739). Hypophosphorylates RB1 in early G(1) phase (PubMed:8114739). Cyclin D-CDK4 complexes are major integrators of various mitogenenic and antimitogenic signals (PubMed:8114739). Component of the ternary complex, cyclin D3/CDK4/CDKN1B, required for nuclear translocation and activity of the cyclin D-CDK4 complex (PubMed:16782892). Shows transcriptional coactivator activity with ATF5 independently of CDK4 (PubMed:15358120).
