UniprotID	Q6GMV3
Accession	Q6GMV3
EntryName	PTRD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Putative peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase PTRHD1 (EC 3.1.1.29) (Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	PTRHD1 C2orf79
Length	140
Function	As a putative peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, it might be involved in releasing tRNAs from the ribosome during protein synthesis (Probable). Some evidence, however, suggests that it lacks peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity (PubMed:27235175).
