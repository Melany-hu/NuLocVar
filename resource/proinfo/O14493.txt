UniprotID	O14493
Accession	O14493
EntryName	CLD4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Claudin-4 (Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin receptor) (CPE-R) (CPE-receptor) (Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosomal region 8 protein)
GeneName	CLDN4 CPER CPETR1 WBSCR8
Length	209
Function	Can associate with other claudins to regulate tight junction structural and functional strand dynamics (PubMed:35773259, PubMed:36008380). May coassemble with CLDN8 into tight junction strands containing anion-selective channels that convey paracellular chloride permeability in renal collecting ducts (By similarity) (PubMed:36008380). May integrate into CLDN3 strands to modulate localized tight junction barrier properties (PubMed:35773259, PubMed:36008380). May disrupt strand assembly of channel-forming CLDN2 and CLDN15 and inhibit cation conductance (PubMed:35773259, PubMed:36008380). Cannot form tight junction strands on its own (PubMed:35773259, PubMed:36008380).
