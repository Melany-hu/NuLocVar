EntryName	PCBP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (Alpha-CP2) (Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E2) (hnRNP E2)
GeneName	PCBP2
Length	365
Function	Single-stranded nucleic acid binding protein that binds preferentially to oligo dC (PubMed:12414943, PubMed:7607214). Major cellular poly(rC)-binding protein (PubMed:12414943). Also binds poly(rU) (PubMed:12414943). Acts as a negative regulator of antiviral signaling (PubMed:19881509, PubMed:35322803). Negatively regulates cellular antiviral responses mediated by MAVS signaling (PubMed:19881509). It acts as an adapter between MAVS and the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH, therefore triggering MAVS ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:19881509). Negativeley regulates the cGAS-STING pathway via interaction with CGAS, preventing the formation of liquid-like droplets in which CGAS is activated (PubMed:35322803). Together with PCBP1, required for erythropoiesis, possibly by regulating mRNA splicing (By similarity).
