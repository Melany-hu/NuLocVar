UniprotID	O43818
Accession	O43818;B2R996;Q8IZ30
EntryName	U3IP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	U3 small nucleolar RNA-interacting protein 2 (RRP9 homolog) (U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein-associated 55 kDa protein) (U3 snoRNP-associated 55 kDa protein) (U3-55K)
GeneName	RRP9 RNU3IP2 U355K
Length	475
Function	Component of a nucleolar small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snoRNP) thought to participate in the processing and modification of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) (PubMed:26867678). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
