ProteinName	Inward rectifier potassium channel 13 (Inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir7.1) (Potassium channel, inwardly rectifying subfamily J member 13)
GeneName	KCNJ13
Length	360
Function	Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium. KCNJ13 has a very low single channel conductance, low sensitivity to block by external barium and cesium, and no dependence of its inward rectification properties on the internal blocking particle magnesium.
