UniprotID	O14792
Accession	O14792;B3KUA6;Q6PEY8
EntryName	HS3S1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heparan sulfate glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 1 (EC 2.8.2.23) (Heparan sulfate D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase 1) (3-OST-1) (Heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 1) (h3-OST-1)
GeneName	HS3ST1 3OST 3OST1
Length	307
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) to catalyze the transfer of a sulfo group to position 3 of glucosamine residues in heparan (PubMed:8900198, PubMed:9346953, PubMed:9988768). Catalyzes the rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HSact) (PubMed:8900198, PubMed:9988768). This modification is a crucial step in the biosynthesis of anticoagulant heparan sulfate as it completes the structure of the antithrombin pentasaccharide binding site (PubMed:8900198, PubMed:9988768).
