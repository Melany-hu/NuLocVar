UniprotID	P41597-2
Accession	P41597;A0AVQ3;B2RMT0;O95950;Q4VBL2
EntryName	CCR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (C-C CKR-2) (CC-CKR-2) (CCR-2) (CCR2) (Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 receptor) (MCP-1-R) (CD antigen CD192)
GeneName	CCR2 CMKBR2
Length	360
Function	Key functional receptor for CCL2 but can also bind CCL7, and CCL12 (PubMed:23408426, PubMed:38157855, PubMed:8048929, PubMed:8146186). Also transduces signaling mediated by CCL13 (PubMed:38157855). Its binding with CCL2 on monocytes and macrophages mediates chemotaxis and migration induction through the activation of the PI3K cascade, the small G protein Rac and lamellipodium protrusion (PubMed:38157855). Also acts as a receptor for the beta-defensin DEFB106A/DEFB106B (PubMed:23938203). Regulates the expression of T-cell inflammatory cytokines and T-cell differentiation, promoting the differentiation of T-cells into T-helper 17 cells (Th17) during inflammation (By similarity). Facilitates the export of mature thymocytes by enhancing directional movement of thymocytes to sphingosine-1-phosphate stimulation and up-regulation of S1P1R expression; signals through the JAK-STAT pathway to regulate FOXO1 activity leading to an increased expression of S1P1R (By similarity). Plays an important role in mediating peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain (By similarity). Increases NMDA-mediated synaptic transmission in both dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-containing neurons, which may be caused by MAPK/ERK-dependent phosphorylation of GRIN2B/NMDAR2B (By similarity). Mediates the recruitment of macrophages and monocytes to the injury site following brain injury (By similarity).
