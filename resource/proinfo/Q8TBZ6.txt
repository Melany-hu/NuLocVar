UniprotID	Q8TBZ6
Accession	Q8TBZ6;B2R8X7;Q9Y2T9
EntryName	TM10A_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA methyltransferase 10 homolog A (EC 2.1.1.221) (RNA (guanine-9-)-methyltransferase domain-containing protein 2) (tRNA (guanine(9)-N(1))-methyltransferase TRMT10A)
GeneName	TRMT10A RG9MTD2
Length	339
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent guanine N(1)-methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of N(1)-methylguanine at position 9 (m1G9) in tRNAs (PubMed:23042678, PubMed:25053765). Probably not able to catalyze formation of N(1)-methyladenine at position 9 (m1A9) in tRNAs (PubMed:23042678).
