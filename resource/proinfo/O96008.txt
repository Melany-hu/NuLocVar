UniprotID	O96008
Accession	O96008;A0A024R0P9;Q86VW4;Q8WY09;Q8WY10;Q8WY11;Q9BR95
EntryName	TOM40_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM40 homolog (Protein Haymaker) (Translocase of outer membrane 40 kDa subunit homolog) (p38.5)
GeneName	TOMM40 C19orf1 PEREC1 TOM40
Length	361
Function	Channel-forming protein essential for import of protein precursors into mitochondria (PubMed:15644312, PubMed:31206022). Plays a role in the assembly of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) by forming a complex with BCAP31 and mediating the translocation of Complex I components from the cytosol to the mitochondria (PubMed:31206022).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane
