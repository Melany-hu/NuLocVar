UniprotID	P49286
Accession	P49286
EntryName	MTR1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Melatonin receptor type 1B (Mel-1B-R) (Mel1b receptor)
GeneName	MTNR1B
Length	362
Function	High affinity receptor for melatonin. Likely to mediate the reproductive and circadian actions of melatonin. The activity of this receptor is mediated by pertussis toxin sensitive G proteins that inhibit adenylate cyclase activity.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
