UniprotID	Q6DN72
Accession	Q6DN72;A1KXW6;A2A4D6;Q6DN73;Q6XRC3;Q6ZNI1
EntryName	FCRL6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fc receptor-like protein 6 (FcR-like protein 6) (FcRL6) (Fc receptor homolog 6) (FcRH6) (IFGP6)
GeneName	FCRL6 FCRH6
Length	434
Function	Acts as a MHC class II receptor (PubMed:20519654). When stimulated on its own, does not play a role in cytokine production or the release of cytotoxic granules by NK cells and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells (PubMed:17213291, PubMed:18991291). Does not act as an Fc receptor (PubMed:18991291).
