UniprotID	Q5T7M4
Accession	Q5T7M4;Q5EBL5
EntryName	ADIPL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adipolin (Adipose-derived insulin-sensitizing factor) (C1q and TNF related protein 12) (Complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 12) [Cleaved into: Adipolin fC1QTNF12 (Adipolin fCTRP12) (Adipolin full-length form); Adipolin gC1QTNF12 (Adipolin cleaved form) (Adipolin gCTRP12)]
GeneName	C1QTNF12 C1QDC2 CTRP12 FAM132A
Length	302
Function	Insulin-sensitizing adipocyte-secreted protein (adipokine) that regulates glucose metabolism in liver and adipose tissue. Promotes glucose uptake in adipocytes and suppresses de novo glucose production in hepatocytes via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Administration lead to reduction of blood glucose. Able to attenuate inflammation in fat tissue.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Secreted
