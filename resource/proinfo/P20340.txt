UniprotID	P20340
Accession	P20340;A8K133;B7Z772;F5H668;Q1W5D8;Q5U0A8;Q9UBE4
EntryName	RAB6A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-6A (Rab-6) (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB6A RAB6
Length	208
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes (PubMed:25962623). Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (PubMed:25962623). RAB6A acts as a regulator of COPI-independent retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus towards the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (PubMed:25962623). Has a low GTPase activity (PubMed:25962623). Recruits VPS13B to the Golgi membrane (PubMed:25492866). Plays a role in neuron projection development (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Acrosome membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane
