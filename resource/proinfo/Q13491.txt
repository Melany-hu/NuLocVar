UniprotID	Q13491
Accession	Q13491;O76077;Q86X43;Q8N956
EntryName	GPM6B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuronal membrane glycoprotein M6-b (M6b)
GeneName	GPM6B M6B
Length	265
Function	May be involved in neural development. Involved in regulation of osteoblast function and bone formation. Involved in matrix vesicle release by osteoblasts; this function seems to involve maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton. May be involved in cellular trafficking of SERT and thereby in regulation of serotonin uptake.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
