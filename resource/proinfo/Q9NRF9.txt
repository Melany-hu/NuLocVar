UniprotID	Q9NRF9
Accession	Q9NRF9;Q5W0U1;Q8N758;Q8NCE5;Q9NR32
EntryName	DPOE3_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA polymerase epsilon subunit 3 (Arsenic-transactivated protein) (AsTP) (Chromatin accessibility complex 17 kDa protein) (CHRAC-17) (HuCHRAC17) (DNA polymerase II subunit 3) (DNA polymerase epsilon subunit p17)
GeneName	POLE3 CHRAC17
Length	147
Function	Accessory component of the DNA polymerase epsilon complex (PubMed:10801849). Participates in DNA repair and in chromosomal DNA replication (By similarity). Forms a complex with CHRAC1 and binds naked DNA, which is then incorporated into chromatin, aided by the nucleosome-remodeling activity of ISWI/SNF2H and ACF1 (PubMed:10801849). Does not enhance nucleosome sliding activity of the ACF-5 ISWI chromatin remodeling complex (PubMed:14759371).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
