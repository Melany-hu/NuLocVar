UniprotID	P09234
Accession	P09234;Q5TAL3
EntryName	RU1C_HUMAN
ProteinName	U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (U1 snRNP C) (U1-C) (U1C)
GeneName	SNRPC
Length	159
Function	Component of the spliceosomal U1 snRNP, which is essential for recognition of the pre-mRNA 5' splice-site and the subsequent assembly of the spliceosome. SNRPC/U1-C is directly involved in initial 5' splice-site recognition for both constitutive and regulated alternative splicing. The interaction with the 5' splice-site seems to precede base-pairing between the pre-mRNA and the U1 snRNA. Stimulates commitment or early (E) complex formation by stabilizing the base pairing of the 5' end of the U1 snRNA and the 5' splice-site region.
