UniprotID	Q6UXV4
Accession	Q6UXV4;Q3KNU7;Q5H9D1
EntryName	MIC27_HUMAN
ProteinName	MICOS complex subunit MIC27 (Apolipoprotein O-like) (Protein FAM121A)
GeneName	APOOL CXorf33 FAM121A MIC27 UNQ8193/PRO23204
Length	268
Function	Component of the MICOS complex, a large protein complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane that plays crucial roles in the maintenance of crista junctions, inner membrane architecture, and formation of contact sites to the outer membrane. Specifically binds to cardiolipin (in vitro) but not to the precursor lipid phosphatidylglycerol. Plays a crucial role in crista junction formation and mitochondrial function (PubMed:23704930), (PubMed:25764979).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Mitochondrion
