UniprotID	Q7Z4Y8
Accession	Q7Z4Y8
EntryName	AT5L2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Putative ATP synthase subunit g 2, mitochondrial (ATPase subunit g 2) (ATP synthase membrane subunit g-like protein)
GeneName	ATP5MGL ATP5K2 ATP5L2
Length	100
Function	Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. Part of the complex F(0) domain. Minor subunit located with subunit a in the membrane (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion membrane
