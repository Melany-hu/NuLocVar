UniprotID	Q9UBP4
Accession	Q9UBP4;A8K1I2;D3DQW1;Q9ULB7
EntryName	DKK3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dickkopf-related protein 3 (Dickkopf-3) (Dkk-3) (hDkk-3)
GeneName	DKK3 REIC UNQ258/PRO295
Length	350
Function	Antagonizes canonical Wnt signaling by inhibiting LRP5/6 interaction with Wnt and by forming a ternary complex with the transmembrane protein KREMEN that promotes internalization of LRP5/6. DKKs play an important role in vertebrate development, where they locally inhibit Wnt regulated processes such as antero-posterior axial patterning, limb development, somitogenesis and eye formation. In the adult, Dkks are implicated in bone formation and bone disease, cancer and Alzheimer disease (By similarity).
