UniprotID	Q8TBX8
Accession	Q8TBX8;B2RDL3;B4DM11;B4DY44;Q9H6N2
EntryName	PI42C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase type-2 gamma (EC 2.7.1.149) (Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase type II gamma) (PI(5)P 4-kinase type II gamma) (PIP4KII-gamma)
GeneName	PIP4K2C PIP5K2C
Length	421
Function	Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase with low enzymatic activity. May be a GTP sensor, has higher GTP-dependent kinase activity than ATP-dependent kinase activity. PIP4Ks negatively regulate insulin signaling through a catalytic-independent mechanism. They interact with PIP5Ks and suppress PIP5K-mediated PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis and insulin-dependent conversion to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PubMed:31091439).
