UniprotID	Q8TBK2
Accession	Q8TBK2;A8K380;B5ME38;Q9H787
EntryName	SETD6_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-lysine methyltransferase SETD6 (EC 2.1.1.-) (SET domain-containing protein 6)
GeneName	SETD6
Length	473
Function	Protein-lysine N-methyltransferase. Monomethylates 'Lys-310' of the RELA subunit of NF-kappa-B complex, leading to down-regulation of NF-kappa-B transcription factor activity (PubMed:21131967, PubMed:21515635, PubMed:30189201). Monomethylates 'Lys-8' of H2AZ (H2AZK8me1) (PubMed:23324626). Required for the maintenance of embryonic stem cell self-renewal (By similarity). Methylates PAK4.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
