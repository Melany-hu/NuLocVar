UniprotID	Q9H3R5
Accession	Q9H3R5;A8K3Y1
EntryName	CENPH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Centromere protein H (CENP-H) (Interphase centromere complex protein 35)
GeneName	CENPH ICEN35
Length	247
Function	Component of the CENPA-NAC (nucleosome-associated) complex, a complex that plays a central role in assembly of kinetochore proteins, mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. The CENPA-NAC complex recruits the CENPA-CAD (nucleosome distal) complex and may be involved in incorporation of newly synthesized CENPA into centromeres. Required for chromosome congression and efficiently align the chromosomes on a metaphase plate.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome; Centromere; Kinetochore
