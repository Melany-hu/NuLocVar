EntryName	CRDL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chordin-like protein 2 (Breast tumor novel factor 1) (BNF-1) (Chordin-related protein 2)
GeneName	CHRDL2 BNF1 CHL2 UNQ765/PRO1557
Length	142
Function	May inhibit BMPs activity by blocking their interaction with their receptors. Has a negative regulator effect on the cartilage formation/regeneration from immature mesenchymal cells, by preventing or reducing the rate of matrix accumulation (By similarity). Implicated in tumor angiogenesis. May play a role during myoblast and osteoblast differentiation, and maturation.
