UniprotID	Q8NFH4
Accession	Q8NFH4;Q9H644
EntryName	NUP37_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleoporin Nup37 (p37) (Nup107-160 subcomplex subunit Nup37)
GeneName	NUP37
Length	326
Function	Component of the Nup107-160 subcomplex of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The Nup107-160 subcomplex is required for the assembly of a functional NPC. The Nup107-160 subcomplex is also required for normal kinetochore microtubule attachment, mitotic progression and chromosome segregation.
