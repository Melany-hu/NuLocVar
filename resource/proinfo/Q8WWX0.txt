UniprotID	Q8WWX0
Accession	Q8WWX0;Q8N7B5
EntryName	ASB5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 5 (ASB-5)
GeneName	ASB5
Length	329
Function	May be a substrate-recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin-Cullin-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. May play a role in the initiation of arteriogenesis (By similarity).
