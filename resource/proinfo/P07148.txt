UniprotID	P07148
Accession	P07148
EntryName	FABPL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fatty acid-binding protein, liver (Fatty acid-binding protein 1) (Liver-type fatty acid-binding protein) (L-FABP)
GeneName	FABP1 FABPL
Length	127
Function	Plays a role in lipoprotein-mediated cholesterol uptake in hepatocytes (PubMed:25732850). Binds cholesterol (PubMed:25732850). Binds free fatty acids and their coenzyme A derivatives, bilirubin, and some other small molecules in the cytoplasm. May be involved in intracellular lipid transport (By similarity).
