UniprotID	P30086
Accession	P30086;B2R4S1
EntryName	PEBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP-1) (HCNPpp) (Neuropolypeptide h3) (Prostatic-binding protein) (Raf kinase inhibitor protein) (RKIP) [Cleaved into: Hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP)]
GeneName	PEBP1 PBP PEBP
Length	187
Function	Binds ATP, opioids and phosphatidylethanolamine. Has lower affinity for phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine. Serine protease inhibitor which inhibits thrombin, neuropsin and chymotrypsin but not trypsin, tissue type plasminogen activator and elastase (By similarity). Inhibits the kinase activity of RAF1 by inhibiting its activation and by dissociating the RAF1/MEK complex and acting as a competitive inhibitor of MEK phosphorylation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
