UniprotID	P31689
Accession	P31689;Q5T7Q0;Q86TL9
EntryName	DNJA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	DnaJ homolog subfamily A member 1 (DnaJ protein homolog 2) (HSDJ) (Heat shock 40 kDa protein 4) (Heat shock protein J2) (HSJ-2) (Human DnaJ protein 2) (hDj-2)
GeneName	DNAJA1 DNAJ2 HDJ2 HSJ2 HSPF4
Length	397
Function	Co-chaperone for HSPA8/Hsc70 (PubMed:10816573). Stimulates ATP hydrolysis, but not the folding of unfolded proteins mediated by HSPA1A (in vitro) (PubMed:24318877). Plays a role in protein transport into mitochondria via its role as co-chaperone. Functions as a co-chaperone for HSPA1B and negatively regulates the translocation of BAX from the cytosol to mitochondria in response to cellular stress, thereby protecting cells against apoptosis (PubMed:14752510). Promotes apoptosis in response to cellular stress mediated by exposure to anisomycin or UV (PubMed:24512202).
