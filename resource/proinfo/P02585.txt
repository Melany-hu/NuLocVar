UniprotID	P02585
Accession	P02585;Q6FH92
EntryName	TNNC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Troponin C, skeletal muscle
GeneName	TNNC2
Length	160
Function	Troponin is the central regulatory protein of striated muscle contraction. Tn consists of three components: Tn-I which is the inhibitor of actomyosin ATPase, Tn-T which contains the binding site for tropomyosin and Tn-C. The binding of calcium to Tn-C abolishes the inhibitory action of Tn on actin filaments.
