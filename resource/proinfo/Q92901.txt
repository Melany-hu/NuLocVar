UniprotID	Q92901
Accession	Q92901
EntryName	RL3L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosomal protein uL3-like (60S ribosomal protein L3-like) (Large ribosomal subunit protein uL3-like)
GeneName	RPL3L
Length	407
Function	Heart- and skeletal muscle-specific component of the ribosome, which regulates muscle function. Component of the large ribosomal subunit in striated muscle cells: replaces the RPL3 paralog in the ribosome in these cells. The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell. Inhibits myotube growth and muscle function.
