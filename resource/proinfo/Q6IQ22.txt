UniprotID	Q6IQ22
Accession	Q6IQ22;A6NEF5;Q4KMQ3
EntryName	RAB12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-12 (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB12
Length	244
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (By similarity). RAB12 may play a role in protein transport from recycling endosomes to lysosomes regulating, for instance, the degradation of the transferrin receptor. Involved in autophagy (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Recycling endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome
