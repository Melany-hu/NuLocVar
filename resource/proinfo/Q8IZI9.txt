UniprotID	Q8IZI9
Accession	Q8IZI9;A2BDE1;Q6VN56;Q7Z4J3;Q8IWL6
EntryName	IFNL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon lambda-3 (IFN-lambda-3) (Cytokine Zcyto22) (Interleukin-28B) (IL-28B) (Interleukin-28C) (IL-28C)
GeneName	IFNL3 IL28B IL28C ZCYTO22
Length	196
Function	Cytokine with antiviral, antitumour and immunomodulatory activities. Plays a critical role in the antiviral host defense, predominantly in the epithelial tissues. Acts as a ligand for the heterodimeric class II cytokine receptor composed of IL10RB and IFNLR1, and receptor engagement leads to the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway resulting in the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), which mediate the antiviral state. Has a restricted receptor distribution and therefore restricted targets: is primarily active in epithelial cells and this cell type-selective action is because of the epithelial cell-specific expression of its receptor IFNLR1. Seems not to be essential for early virus-activated host defense in vaginal infection, but plays an important role in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced antiviral defense. Plays a significant role in the antiviral immune defense in the intestinal epithelium. Exerts an immunomodulatory effect by up-regulating MHC class I antigen expression.
