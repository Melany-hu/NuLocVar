EntryName	DPH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	2-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)histidine synthase subunit 1 (EC 2.5.1.108) (Diphthamide biosynthesis protein 1) (Diphtheria toxin resistance protein 1) (Ovarian cancer-associated gene 1 protein) (S-adenosyl-L-methionine:L-histidine 3-amino-3-carboxypropyltransferase 1)
GeneName	DPH1 DPH2L DPH2L1 OVCA1
Length	438
Function	Catalyzes the first step of diphthamide biosynthesis, a post-translational modification of histidine which occurs in elongation factor 2 (PubMed:30877278). DPH1 and DPH2 transfer a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to a histidine residue, the reaction is assisted by a reduction system comprising DPH3 and a NADH-dependent reductase (By similarity). Acts as a tumor suppressor (PubMed:10519411).
