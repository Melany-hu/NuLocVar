UniprotID	Q6NXT2
Accession	Q6NXT2;E9P281
EntryName	H3C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H3.3C (Histone H3.5)
GeneName	H3-5 H3F3C
Length	135
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling. Hominid-specific H3.5/H3F3C preferentially colocalizes with euchromatin, and it is associated with actively transcribed genes.
