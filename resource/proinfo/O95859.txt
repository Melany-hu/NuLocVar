EntryName	TSN12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tetraspanin-12 (Tspan-12) (Tetraspan NET-2) (Transmembrane 4 superfamily member 12)
GeneName	TSPAN12 NET2 TM4SF12 UNQ774/PRO1568
Length	305
Function	Regulator of cell surface receptor signal transduction. Plays a central role in retinal vascularization by regulating norrin (NDP) signal transduction. Acts in concert with norrin (NDP) to promote FZD4 multimerization and subsequent activation of FZD4, leading to promote accumulation of beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and stimulate LEF/TCF-mediated transcriptional programs. Suprisingly, it only activates the norrin (NDP)-dependent activation of FZD4, while it does not activate the Wnt-dependent activation of FZD4, suggesting the existence of a Wnt-independent signaling that also promote accumulation the beta-catenin (CTNNB1) (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of membrane proteinases such as ADAM10 and MMP14/MT1-MMP. Activates ADAM10-dependent cleavage activity of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Activates MMP14/MT1-MMP-dependent cleavage activity.
