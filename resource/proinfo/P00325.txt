EntryName	ADH1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	All-trans-retinol dehydrogenase [NAD(+)] ADH1B (EC 1.1.1.105) (Alcohol dehydrogenase 1B) (Alcohol dehydrogenase subunit beta)
GeneName	ADH1B ADH2
Length	375
Function	Catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of all-trans-retinol and its derivatives such as all-trans-4-hydroxyretinol and may participate in retinoid metabolism (PubMed:15369820, PubMed:16787387). In vitro can also catalyze the NADH-dependent reduction of all-trans-retinal and its derivatives such as all-trans-4-oxoretinal (PubMed:15369820, PubMed:16787387). Catalyzes in the oxidative direction with higher efficiency (PubMed:16787387). Has the same affinity for all-trans-4-hydroxyretinol and all-trans-4-oxoretinal (PubMed:15369820).
