Accession	Q6Q788;B0YIV9;Q3MIK6;Q6UWK9;Q9UBJ3
EntryName	APOA5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Apolipoprotein A-V (Apo-AV) (ApoA-V) (Apolipoprotein A5) (Regeneration-associated protein 3)
GeneName	APOA5 RAP3 UNQ411/PRO773
Length	366
Function	Minor apolipoprotein mainly associated with HDL and to a lesser extent with VLDL. May also be associated with chylomicrons. Important determinant of plasma triglyceride (TG) levels by both being a potent stimulator of apo-CII lipoprotein lipase (LPL) TG hydrolysis and an inhibitor of the hepatic VLDL-TG production rate (without affecting the VLDL-apoB production rate) (By similarity). Activates poorly lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and does not enhance efflux of cholesterol from macrophages. Binds heparin (PubMed:17326667).
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Early endosome; Late endosome; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network
