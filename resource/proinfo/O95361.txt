UniprotID	O95361
Accession	O95361;Q6IAL8;Q7Z6I2;Q96BE8;Q96J43
EntryName	TRI16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tripartite motif-containing protein 16 (EC 2.3.2.27) (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM16) (Estrogen-responsive B box protein)
GeneName	TRIM16 EBBP
Length	564
Function	E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays an essential role in the organization of autophagic response and ubiquitination upon lysosomal and phagosomal damages. Plays a role in the stress-induced biogenesis and degradation of protein aggresomes by regulating the p62-KEAP1-NRF2 signaling and particularly by modulating the ubiquitination levels and thus stability of NRF2. Acts as a scaffold protein and facilitates autophagic degradation of protein aggregates by interacting with p62/SQSTM, ATG16L1 and LC3B/MAP1LC3B. In turn, protects the cell against oxidative stress-induced cell death as a consequence of endomembrane damage.
