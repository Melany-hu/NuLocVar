UniprotID	Q9BYC8
Accession	Q9BYC8;Q96Q68;Q9P098
EntryName	RM32_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein bL32m (39S ribosomal protein L32, mitochondrial) (L32mt) (MRP-L32)
GeneName	MRPL32 HSPC283
Length	188
Function	Component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU) (PubMed:25278503, PubMed:25838379, PubMed:28892042). The mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins inside mitochondria (PubMed:25278503, PubMed:25838379, PubMed:28892042).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
