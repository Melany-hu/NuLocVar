Accession	Q9H974;A6NGE9;B7Z472;B7Z5R2;J3KR78;Q6IA59
EntryName	QTRT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase accessory subunit 2 (Queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	QTRT2 QTRTD1
Length	415
Function	Non-catalytic subunit of the queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase (TGT) that catalyzes the base-exchange of a guanine (G) residue with queuine (Q) at position 34 (anticodon wobble position) in tRNAs with GU(N) anticodons (tRNA-Asp, -Asn, -His and -Tyr), resulting in the hypermodified nucleoside queuosine (7-(((4,5-cis-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-yl)amino)methyl)-7-deazaguanosine).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Mitochondrion outer membrane
