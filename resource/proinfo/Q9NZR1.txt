UniprotID	Q9NZR1
Accession	Q9NZR1;B4DEW6
EntryName	TMOD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tropomodulin-2 (Neuronal tropomodulin) (N-Tmod)
GeneName	TMOD2 NTMOD
Length	351
Function	Blocks the elongation and depolymerization of the actin filaments at the pointed end. The Tmod/TM complex contributes to the formation of the short actin protofilament, which in turn defines the geometry of the membrane skeleton (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
