Accession	O15503;A4D2N1;A8K6L0;Q53XW8;Q9BUV5
EntryName	INSI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Insulin-induced gene 1 protein (INSIG-1)
GeneName	INSIG1
Length	277
Function	Oxysterol-binding protein that mediates feedback control of cholesterol synthesis by controlling both endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport of SCAP and degradation of HMGCR (PubMed:12202038, PubMed:12535518, PubMed:16168377, PubMed:16399501, PubMed:16606821, PubMed:32322062). Acts as a negative regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis by mediating the retention of the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby blocking the processing of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) SREBF1/SREBP1 and SREBF2/SREBP2 (PubMed:12202038, PubMed:16399501, PubMed:26311497, PubMed:32322062). Binds oxysterol, including 25-hydroxycholesterol, regulating interaction with SCAP and retention of the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:32322062). In presence of oxysterol, interacts with SCAP, retaining the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby preventing SCAP from escorting SREBF1/SREBP1 and SREBF2/SREBP2 to the Golgi (PubMed:15899885, PubMed:32322062). Sterol deprivation or phosphorylation by PCK1 reduce oxysterol-binding, disrupting the interaction between INSIG1 and SCAP, thereby promoting Golgi transport of the SCAP-SREBP complex, followed by processing and nuclear translocation of SREBF1/SREBP1 and SREBF2/SREBP2 (PubMed:26311497, PubMed:32322062). Also regulates cholesterol synthesis by regulating degradation of HMGCR: initiates the sterol-mediated ubiquitin-mediated endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of HMGCR via recruitment of the reductase to the ubiquitin ligases AMFR/gp78 and/or RNF139 (PubMed:12535518, PubMed:16168377, PubMed:22143767). Also regulates degradation of SOAT2/ACAT2 when the lipid levels are low: initiates the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SOAT2/ACAT2 via recruitment of the ubiquitin ligases AMFR/gp78 (PubMed:28604676).
