UniprotID	Q8N6D2
Accession	Q8N6D2;B2RDG2;Q8NBG3
EntryName	RN182_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF182 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 182) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase RNF182)
GeneName	RNF182
Length	247
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates the ubiquitination of ATP6V0C and targets it to degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (PubMed:18298843). Also plays a role in the inhibition of TLR-triggered innate immune response by mediating 'Lys'-48-linked ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of NF-kappa-B component RELA (PubMed:31432514).
