UniprotID	Q6UXN8
Accession	Q6UXN8;B0ZBM2
EntryName	CLC9A_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-type lectin domain family 9 member A (CD antigen CD370)
GeneName	CLEC9A UNQ9341/PRO34046
Length	241
Function	Functions as an endocytic receptor on a small subset of myeloid cells specialized for the uptake and processing of material from dead cells. Recognizes filamentous form of actin in association with particular actin-binding domains of cytoskeletal proteins, including spectrin, exposed when cell membranes are damaged, and mediate the cross-presentation of dead-cell associated antigens in a Syk-dependent manner.
