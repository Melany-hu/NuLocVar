Accession	Q93015;Q93014
EntryName	NAA80_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-alpha-acetyltransferase 80 (HsNAAA80) (EC 2.3.1.-) (N-acetyltransferase 6) (Protein fusion-2) (Protein fus-2)
GeneName	NAA80 FUS2 NAT6
Length	286
Function	N-alpha-acetyltransferase that specifically mediates the acetylation of the acidic amino terminus of processed forms of beta- and gamma-actin (ACTB and ACTG, respectively) (PubMed:29581253, PubMed:30028079). N-terminal acetylation of processed beta- and gamma-actin regulates actin filament depolymerization and elongation (PubMed:29581253). In vivo, preferentially displays N-terminal acetyltransferase activity towards acid N-terminal sequences starting with Asp-Asp-Asp and Glu-Glu-Glu (PubMed:29581253, PubMed:30028079). In vitro, shows high activity towards Met-Asp-Glu-Leu and Met-Asp-Asp-Asp (PubMed:10644992, PubMed:29581307). May act as a tumor suppressor (PubMed:10644992).
