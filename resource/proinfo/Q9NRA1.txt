UniprotID	Q9NRA1
Accession	Q9NRA1;B4DU34;B9EGR8;Q4W5M9;Q9UL22
EntryName	PDGFC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGF-C) (Fallotein) (Spinal cord-derived growth factor) (SCDGF) (VEGF-E) [Cleaved into: Platelet-derived growth factor C, latent form (PDGFC latent form); Platelet-derived growth factor C, receptor-binding form (PDGFC receptor-binding form)]
GeneName	PDGFC SCDGF UNQ174/PRO200
Length	345
Function	Growth factor that plays an essential role in the regulation of embryonic development, cell proliferation, cell migration, survival and chemotaxis. Potent mitogen and chemoattractant for cells of mesenchymal origin. Required for normal skeleton formation during embryonic development, especially for normal development of the craniofacial skeleton and for normal development of the palate. Required for normal skin morphogenesis during embryonic development. Plays an important role in wound healing, where it appears to be involved in three stages: inflammation, proliferation and remodeling. Plays an important role in angiogenesis and blood vessel development. Involved in fibrotic processes, in which transformation of interstitial fibroblasts into myofibroblasts plus collagen deposition occurs. The CUB domain has mitogenic activity in coronary artery smooth muscle cells, suggesting a role beyond the maintenance of the latency of the PDGF domain. In the nucleus, PDGFC seems to have additional function.
