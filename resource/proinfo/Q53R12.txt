UniprotID	Q53R12
Accession	Q53R12;B2RP42;Q5U609;Q6UWS1;Q9H5X9
EntryName	T4S20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane 4 L6 family member 20
GeneName	TM4SF20 UNQ518/PRO994
Length	229
Function	Polytopic transmembrane protein that inhibits regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of CREB3L1, inhibiting its activation and the induction of collagen synthesis (PubMed:25310401, PubMed:27499293). In response to ceramide, which alters TM4SF20 membrane topology, stimulates RIP activation of CREB3L1 (PubMed:27499293). Ceramide reverses the direction through which transmembrane helices are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane during translation of TM4SF20, this mechanism is called 'regulated alternative translocation' (RAT) and regulates the function of the transmembrane protein (PubMed:27499293).
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
