UniprotID	Q8ND56
Accession	Q8ND56;B4DTG6;Q76LX7;Q96AR3;Q96K73;Q96SN5;Q9UFR3
EntryName	LS14A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein LSM14 homolog A (Protein FAM61A) (Protein SCD6 homolog) (Putative alpha-synuclein-binding protein) (AlphaSNBP) (RNA-associated protein 55A) (hRAP55) (hRAP55A)
GeneName	LSM14A C19orf13 FAM61A RAP55 RAP55A
Length	463
Function	Essential for formation of P-bodies, cytoplasmic structures that provide storage sites for translationally inactive mRNAs and protect them from degradation (PubMed:16484376, PubMed:17074753, PubMed:29510985). Acts as a repressor of mRNA translation (PubMed:29510985). May play a role in mitotic spindle assembly (PubMed:26339800).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; P-body; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Spindle; Cytoplasm; Stress granule
