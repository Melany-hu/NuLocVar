EntryName	IGF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Insulin-like growth factor II) (IGF-II) (Somatomedin-A) (T3M-11-derived growth factor) [Cleaved into: Insulin-like growth factor II Ala-25 Del; Preptin]
GeneName	IGF2 IGF-2 PP1446
Length	236
Function	The insulin-like growth factors possess growth-promoting activity (By similarity). Major fetal growth hormone in mammals. Plays a key role in regulating fetoplacental development. IGF2 is influenced by placental lactogen. Also involved in tissue differentiation. In adults, involved in glucose metabolism in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver (Probable). Acts as a ligand for integrin which is required for IGF2 signaling (PubMed:28873464). Positively regulates myogenic transcription factor MYOD1 function by facilitating the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators, thereby controlling muscle terminal differentiation (By similarity). Inhibits myoblast differentiation and modulates metabolism via increasing the mitochondrial respiration rate (By similarity).
