UniprotID	Q7Z569
Accession	Q7Z569;B4DRM1;B9EGS8;O43238;O75341
EntryName	BRAP_HUMAN
ProteinName	BRCA1-associated protein (EC 2.3.2.27) (BRAP2) (Impedes mitogenic signal propagation) (IMP) (RING finger protein 52) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase BRAP2) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-63)
GeneName	BRAP RNF52
Length	592
Function	Negatively regulates MAP kinase activation by limiting the formation of Raf/MEK complexes probably by inactivation of the KSR1 scaffold protein. Also acts as a Ras responsive E3 ubiquitin ligase that, on activation of Ras, is modified by auto-polyubiquitination resulting in the release of inhibition of Raf/MEK complex formation. May also act as a cytoplasmic retention protein with a role in regulating nuclear transport.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
