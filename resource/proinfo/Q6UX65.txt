UniprotID	Q6UX65
Accession	Q6UX65;B3SUG9;Q4VWF6;Q86VD3;Q8NBQ4
EntryName	DRAM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator protein 2 (Transmembrane protein 77)
GeneName	DRAM2 TMEM77 PSEC0031 UNQ154/PRO180
Length	266
Function	Plays a role in the initiation of autophagy. In the retina, might be involved in the process of photoreceptor cells renewal and recycling to preserve visual function. Induces apoptotic cell death when coexpressed with DRAM1.
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane; Photoreceptor inner segment; Apical cell membrane
