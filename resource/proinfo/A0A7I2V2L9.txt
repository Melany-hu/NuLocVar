UniprotID	A0A7I2V2L9
Accession	A0A7I2V2L9
EntryName	A0A7I2V2L9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein uL13 (60S ribosomal protein L13a)
GeneName	RPL13A
Length	198
Function	Associated with ribosomes but is not required for canonical ribosome function and has extra-ribosomal functions. Component of the GAIT (gamma interferon-activated inhibitor of translation) complex which mediates interferon-gamma-induced transcript-selective translation inhibition in inflammation processes. Upon interferon-gamma activation and subsequent phosphorylation dissociates from the ribosome and assembles into the GAIT complex which binds to stem loop-containing GAIT elements in the 3'-UTR of diverse inflammatory mRNAs (such as ceruplasmin) and suppresses their translation. In the GAIT complex interacts with m7G cap-bound eIF4G at or near the eIF3-binding site and blocks the recruitment of the 43S ribosomal complex. Involved in methylation of rRNA.
