Accession	Q8N5Z5;B0QYA9;B0QYB0;O95517
EntryName	KCD17_HUMAN
ProteinName	BTB/POZ domain-containing protein KCTD17
GeneName	KCTD17
Length	314
Function	Substrate-adapter for CUL3-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of TCHP, a protein involved in ciliogenesis down-regulation. Thereby, positively regulates ciliogenesis, playing a crucial role in the initial steps of axoneme extension (PubMed:25270598). May also play a role in endoplasmic reticulum calcium ion homeostasis (PubMed:25983243).
