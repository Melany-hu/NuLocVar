UniprotID	Q6UXH0
Accession	Q6UXH0;Q9NQZ1
EntryName	ANGL8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Angiopoietin-like protein 8 (Betatrophin) (Lipasin) (Refeeding-induced fat and liver protein)
GeneName	ANGPTL8 C19orf80 RIFL UNQ599/PRO1185
Length	198
Function	Hormone that acts as a blood lipid regulator by regulating serum triglyceride levels (PubMed:22569073, PubMed:22809513, PubMed:23150577).
