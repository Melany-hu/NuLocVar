EntryName	KIF25_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kinesin-like protein KIF25 (Kinesin-like protein 3)
GeneName	KIF25 KNSL3
Length	384
Function	Minus-end microtubule-dependent motor protein (By similarity). Acts as a negative regulator of centrosome separation required to prevent premature centrosome separation during interphase (PubMed:28263957). Required to maintain a centered nucleus to ensure that the spindle is stably oriented at the onset of mitosis (PubMed:28263957). May also act as a negative regulator of amino acid starvation-induced autophagy (PubMed:22354037).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome
