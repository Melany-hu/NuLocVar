ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(o) subunit alpha (EC 3.6.5.-)
GeneName	GNAO1
Length	354
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in numerous signaling cascades (PubMed:29925951). The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (By similarity). Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding (By similarity). The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal (By similarity). Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numerous regulatory proteins (By similarity). Signaling is mediated via effector proteins, such as adenylate cyclase (By similarity). Inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, leading to decreased intracellular cAMP levels (By similarity).
