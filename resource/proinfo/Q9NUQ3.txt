UniprotID	Q9NUQ3
Accession	Q9NUQ3;Q2KQ75;Q5JNZ7;Q9P0X1
EntryName	TXLNG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-taxilin (Environmental lipopolysaccharide-responding gene protein) (Factor inhibiting ATF4-mediated transcription) (FIAT) (Lipopolysaccharide-specific response protein 5)
GeneName	TXLNG CXorf15 ELRG LSR5
Length	528
Function	May be involved in intracellular vesicle traffic. Inhibits ATF4-mediated transcription, possibly by dimerizing with ATF4 to form inactive dimers that cannot bind DNA. May be involved in regulating bone mass density through an ATF4-dependent pathway. May be involved in cell cycle progression.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytosol
