UniprotID	P41219
Accession	P41219;Q8N577
EntryName	PERI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peripherin (Neurofilament 4)
GeneName	PRPH NEF4 PRPH1
Length	470
Function	Class-III neuronal intermediate filament protein (By similarity). May form an independent structural network without the involvement of other neurofilaments or may cooperate with the neuronal intermediate filament proteins NEFL, NEFH, NEFM and INA to form a filamentous network (PubMed:15322088, PubMed:15446584). Assembly of the neuronal intermediate filaments may be regulated by RAB7A (By similarity). Plays a role in the development of unmyelinated sensory neurons (By similarity). May be involved in axon elongation and axon regeneration after injury (By similarity). Inhibits neurite extension in type II spiral ganglion neurons in the cochlea (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cell projection; Axon; Perikaryon
