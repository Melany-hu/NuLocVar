UniprotID	Q9H5H4
Accession	Q9H5H4;Q569L7;Q96CX4
EntryName	ZN768_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein 768
GeneName	ZNF768
Length	540
Function	Binds to mammalian-wide interspersed repeat (MIRs) sequences in euchromatin and promoter regions of genes at the consensus sequence 5'-GCTGTGTG--CCTCTCTG-3', consisting of two anchor regions connected by a linker region; the linker region probably does not contribute to the binding specificity (PubMed:30476274). Required for cell homeostasis (PubMed:34404770). May be involved in transcriptional regulation (Probable).
