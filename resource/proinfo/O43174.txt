EntryName	CP26A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 26A1 (CYP26A1) (EC 1.14.13.-) (Cytochrome P450 retinoic acid-inactivating 1) (Cytochrome P450RAI) (hP450RAI) (Retinoic acid 4-hydroxylase) (Retinoic acid-metabolizing cytochrome)
GeneName	CYP26A1 CYP26 P450RAI1
Length	497
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of retinoates (RAs), the active metabolites of vitamin A, and critical signaling molecules in animals (PubMed:22020119, PubMed:9228017, PubMed:9716180). RAs exist as at least four different isomers: all-trans-RA (atRA), 9-cis-RA, 13-cis-RA, and 9,13-dicis-RA, where atRA is considered to be the biologically active isomer, although 9-cis-RA and 13-cis-RA also have activity (Probable). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of atRA primarily at C-4 and C-18, thereby contributing to the regulation of atRA homeostasis and signaling (PubMed:22020119, PubMed:9228017, PubMed:9716180). Hydroxylation of atRA limits its biological activity and initiates a degradative process leading to its eventual elimination (Probable). Involved in the convertion of atRA to all-trans-4-oxo-RA. Able to metabolize other RAs such as 9-cis, 13-cis and 9,13-di-cis RA (By similarity) (PubMed:9228017). Can oxidize all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoate (DRA) to metabolites which could include all-trans-4-oxo-DRA, all-trans-4-hydroxy-DRA, all-trans-5,8-epoxy-DRA, and all-trans-18-hydroxy-DRA (By similarity). May play a role in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics such as tazarotenic acid (PubMed:26937021).
