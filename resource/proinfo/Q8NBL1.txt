EntryName	PGLT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 (EC 2.4.1.376) (CAP10-like 46 kDa protein) (hCLP46) (KTEL motif-containing protein 1) (Myelodysplastic syndromes relative protein) (O-glucosyltransferase Rumi homolog) (hRumi) (Protein O-xylosyltransferase POGLUT1) (EC 2.4.2.63)
GeneName	POGLUT1 C3orf9 CLP46 KTELC1 MDSRP MDS010 UNQ490/PRO1006
Length	392
Function	Dual specificity glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of glucose and xylose from UDP-glucose and UDP-xylose, respectively, to a serine residue found in the consensus sequence of C-X-S-X-P-C (PubMed:21081508, PubMed:21490058, PubMed:21949356, PubMed:27807076, PubMed:28775322). Specifically targets extracellular EGF repeats of protein such as CRB2, F7, F9 and NOTCH2 (PubMed:21081508, PubMed:21490058, PubMed:21949356, PubMed:27807076, PubMed:28775322). Acts as a positive regulator of Notch signaling by mediating O-glucosylation of Notch, leading to regulate muscle development (PubMed:27807076). Notch glucosylation does not affect Notch ligand binding (PubMed:21490058). Required during early development to promote gastrulation: acts by mediating O-glucosylation of CRB2, which is required for CRB2 localization to the cell membrane (By similarity).
