UniprotID	A6NJT0
Accession	A6NJT0;A4D221
EntryName	UNC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein unc-4 homolog (Homeobox protein Uncx4.1)
GeneName	UNCX UNCX4.1
Length	531
Function	Transcription factor involved in somitogenesis and neurogenesis. Required for the maintenance and differentiation of particular elements of the axial skeleton. May act upstream of PAX9. Plays a role in controlling the development of connections of hypothalamic neurons to pituitary elements, allowing central neurons to reach the peripheral blood circulation and to deliver hormones for control of peripheral functions (By similarity).
