EntryName	MTND_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acireductone dioxygenase (Acireductone dioxygenase (Fe(2+)-requiring)) (ARD') (Fe-ARD) (EC 1.13.11.54) (Acireductone dioxygenase (Ni(2+)-requiring)) (ARD) (Ni-ARD) (EC 1.13.11.53) (Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase cytoplasmic tail-binding protein 1) (MTCBP-1) (Submergence-induced protein-like factor) (Sip-L)
GeneName	ADI1 MTCBP1 HMFT1638
Length	179
Function	Catalyzes 2 different reactions between oxygen and the acireductone 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene (DHK-MTPene) depending upon the metal bound in the active site (By similarity). Fe-containing acireductone dioxygenase (Fe-ARD) produces formate and 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate (KMTB), the alpha-ketoacid precursor of methionine in the methionine recycle pathway (PubMed:15938715). Ni-containing acireductone dioxygenase (Ni-ARD) produces methylthiopropionate, carbon monoxide and formate, and does not lie on the methionine recycle pathway (By similarity). Also down-regulates cell migration mediated by MMP14 (PubMed:14718544). Necessary for hepatitis C virus replication in an otherwise non-permissive cell line (PubMed:11602742).
