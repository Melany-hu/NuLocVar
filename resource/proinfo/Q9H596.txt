UniprotID	Q9H596
Accession	Q9H596;Q0VDA6;Q6IAJ6;Q6YDQ8
EntryName	DUS21_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity protein phosphatase 21 (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.48) (Low molecular weight dual specificity phosphatase 21) (LMW-DSP21)
GeneName	DUSP21 LMWDSP21
Length	190
Function	Protein phosphatase component of the sperm flagellar doublet microtubules (By similarity). May act as a regulator of sperm motility by mediating dephosphorylation of sperm doublet microtubule proteins (By similarity). Can dephosphorylate single and diphosphorylated synthetic MAPK peptides, with preference for the phosphotyrosine and diphosphorylated forms over phosphothreonine (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Mitochondrion inner membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Flagellum axoneme
