UniprotID	P62995
Accession	P62995;B4DVK2;D3DNU3;O15449;Q15815;Q64283
EntryName	TRA2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transformer-2 protein homolog beta (TRA-2 beta) (TRA2-beta) (hTRA2-beta) (Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 10) (Transformer-2 protein homolog B)
GeneName	TRA2B SFRS10
Length	288
Function	Sequence-specific RNA-binding protein which participates in the control of pre-mRNA splicing. Can either activate or suppress exon inclusion. Acts additively with RBMX to promote exon 7 inclusion of the survival motor neuron SMN2. Activates the splicing of MAPT/Tau exon 10. Alters pre-mRNA splicing patterns by antagonizing the effects of splicing regulators, like RBMX. Binds to the AG-rich SE2 domain in the SMN exon 7 RNA. Binds to pre-mRNA.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
