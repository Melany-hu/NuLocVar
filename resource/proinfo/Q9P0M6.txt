UniprotID	Q9P0M6
Accession	Q9P0M6;Q5SQT2
EntryName	H2AW_HUMAN
ProteinName	Core histone macro-H2A.2 (Histone macroH2A2) (mH2A2)
GeneName	MACROH2A2 H2AFY2
Length	372
Function	Variant histone H2A which replaces conventional H2A in a subset of nucleosomes where it represses transcription. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling. May be involved in stable X chromosome inactivation.
