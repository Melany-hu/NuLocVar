UniprotID	A6NI61
Accession	A6NI61
EntryName	MYMK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein myomaker (Myoblast fusion maker) (Transmembrane protein 226) (Transmembrane protein 8C)
GeneName	MYMK TMEM226 TMEM8C
Length	221
Function	Myoblast-specific protein that mediates myoblast fusion, an essential step for the formation of multi-nucleated muscle fibers (PubMed:28681861). Actively participates in the membrane fusion reaction by mediating the mixing of cell membrane lipids (hemifusion) upstream of MYMX. Acts independently of MYMX (By similarity). Involved in skeletal muscle regeneration in response to injury by mediating the fusion of satellite cells, a population of muscle stem cells, with injured myofibers (By similarity). Also involved in skeletal muscle hypertrophy, probably by mediating the fusion of satellite cells with myofibers (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane
