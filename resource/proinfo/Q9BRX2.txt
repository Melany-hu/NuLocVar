ProteinName	Protein pelota homolog (hPelota) (Protein Dom34 homolog)
GeneName	PELO CGI-17
Length	385
Function	Component of the Pelota-HBS1L complex, a complex that recognizes stalled ribosomes and triggers the No-Go Decay (NGD) pathway (PubMed:21448132, PubMed:23667253, PubMed:27543824, PubMed:27863242). In the Pelota-HBS1L complex, PELO recognizes ribosomes stalled at the 3' end of an mRNA and engages stalled ribosomes by destabilizing mRNA in the mRNA channel (PubMed:27543824, PubMed:27863242). Following mRNA extraction from stalled ribosomes by the SKI complex, the Pelota-HBS1L complex promotes recruitment of ABCE1, which drives the disassembly of stalled ribosomes, followed by degradation of damaged mRNAs as part of the NGD pathway (PubMed:21448132, PubMed:32006463). As part of the PINK1-regulated signaling, upon mitochondrial damage is recruited to the ribosome/mRNA-ribonucleoprotein complex associated to mitochondrial outer membrane thereby enabling the recruitment of autophagy receptors and induction of mitophagy (PubMed:29861391).
