Function	Stabilizing factor, of the core iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly complex, that regulates, in association with NDUFAB1, the stability and the cysteine desulfurase activity of NFS1 and participates in the  clusters assembly on the scaffolding protein ISCU (PubMed:17331979, PubMed:31664822). The core iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly complex is involved in the de novo synthesis of a  cluster, the first step of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur protein biogenesis. This process is initiated by the cysteine desulfurase complex (NFS1:LYRM4:NDUFAB1) that produces persulfide which is delivered on the scaffold protein ISCU in a FXN-dependent manner. Then this complex is stabilized by FDX2 which provides reducing equivalents to accomplish the  cluster assembly. Finally, the  cluster is transferred from ISCU to chaperone proteins, including HSCB, HSPA9 and GLRX5 (By similarity). May also participates in the iron-sulfur protein biogenesis in the cytoplasm through its interaction with the cytoplasmic form of NFS1 (PubMed:19454487).
