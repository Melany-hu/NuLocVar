Accession	Q9Y5B8;A8K3T6;A8MY09;B3KSW9;Q5TGZ4
EntryName	NDK7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleoside diphosphate kinase homolog 7 (NDK 7) (NDP kinase homolog 7) (3'-5' exonuclease NME7) (EC 3.1.-.-) (Protein kinase NME7) (EC 2.7.-.-) (nm23-H7)
GeneName	NME7
Length	376
Function	Possesses an intrinsic kinase activity (PubMed:24807905). Displays 3'-5' exonuclease activity with a preference for single-stranded DNA (PubMed:16313181). Does not seem to have nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity (PubMed:16313181, PubMed:24807905). Functional component of the gamma-tubulin ring complex, implicated in the regulation of the microtubule-nucleating activity of the gamma-tubulin ring complex in centrosomes, in a kinase activity-dependent manner (PubMed:24807905). Part of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in cilia axoneme, which is required for motile cilia beating (PubMed:36191189).
