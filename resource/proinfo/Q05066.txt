UniprotID	Q05066
Accession	Q05066
EntryName	SRY_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sex-determining region Y protein (Testis-determining factor)
GeneName	SRY TDF
Length	204
Function	Transcriptional regulator that controls a genetic switch in male development (PubMed:11563911). It is necessary and sufficient for initiating male sex determination by directing the development of supporting cell precursors (pre-Sertoli cells) as Sertoli rather than granulosa cells (PubMed:16414182, PubMed:16996051). Involved in different aspects of gene regulation including promoter activation or repression (PubMed:9525897). Binds to the DNA consensus sequence 5'-AACAA-3' (PubMed:11563911, PubMed:1425584, PubMed:15170344, PubMed:8159753, PubMed:8265659). SRY HMG box recognizes DNA by partial intercalation in the minor groove and promotes DNA bending (PubMed:11563911, PubMed:1425584, PubMed:15170344, PubMed:16762365, PubMed:8159753, PubMed:8265659). Also involved in pre-mRNA splicing (PubMed:11818535). In male adult brain involved in the maintenance of motor functions of dopaminergic neurons (By similarity).
