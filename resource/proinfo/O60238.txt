UniprotID	O60238
Accession	O60238;B0AZS9;Q5JW63;Q8NF87
EntryName	BNI3L_HUMAN
ProteinName	BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3-like (Adenovirus E1B19K-binding protein B5) (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3A) (NIP3-like protein X) (NIP3L)
GeneName	BNIP3L BNIP3A BNIP3H NIX
Length	219
Function	Induces apoptosis. Interacts with viral and cellular anti-apoptosis proteins. Can overcome the suppressors BCL-2 and BCL-XL, although high levels of BCL-XL expression will inhibit apoptosis. Inhibits apoptosis induced by BNIP3. Involved in mitochondrial quality control via its interaction with SPATA18/MIEAP: in response to mitochondrial damage, participates in mitochondrial protein catabolic process (also named MALM) leading to the degradation of damaged proteins inside mitochondria. The physical interaction of SPATA18/MIEAP, BNIP3 and BNIP3L/NIX at the mitochondrial outer membrane regulates the opening of a pore in the mitochondrial double membrane in order to mediate the translocation of lysosomal proteins from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix. May function as a tumor suppressor.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus envelope; Endoplasmic reticulum; Mitochondrion outer membrane; Membrane
