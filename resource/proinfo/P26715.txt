Function	Immune inhibitory receptor involved in self-nonself discrimination. In complex with KLRD1 on cytotoxic and regulatory lymphocyte subsets, recognizes non-classical major histocompatibility (MHC) class Ib molecule HLA-E loaded with self-peptides derived from the signal sequence of classical MHC class Ia molecules. Enables cytotoxic cells to monitor the expression of MHC class I molecules in healthy cells and to tolerate self (PubMed:18083576, PubMed:37264229, PubMed:9430220, PubMed:9486650). Upon HLA-E-peptide binding, transmits intracellular signals through two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs (ITIMs) by recruiting INPP5D/SHP-1 and INPPL1/SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatases to ITIMs, and ultimately opposing signals transmitted by activating receptors through dephosphorylation of proximal signaling molecules (PubMed:12165520, PubMed:9485206). Key inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells that regulates their activation and effector functions (PubMed:30860984, PubMed:9430220, PubMed:9485206, PubMed:9486650). Dominantly counteracts T cell receptor signaling on a subset of memory/effector CD8-positive T cells as part of an antigen-driven response to avoid autoimmunity (PubMed:12387742). On intraepithelial CD8-positive gamma-delta regulatory T cells triggers TGFB1 secretion, which in turn limits the cytotoxic programming of intraepithelial CD8-positive alpha-beta T cells, distinguishing harmless from pathogenic antigens (PubMed:18064301). In HLA-E-rich tumor microenvironment, acts as an immune inhibitory checkpoint and may contribute to progressive loss of effector functions of NK cells and tumor-specific T cells, a state known as cell exhaustion (PubMed:30503213, PubMed:30860984).
