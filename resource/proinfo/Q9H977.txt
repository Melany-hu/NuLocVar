UniprotID	Q9H977
Accession	Q9H977;B9A049;D6W5I3;Q53H85;Q86V45
EntryName	WDR54_HUMAN
ProteinName	WD repeat-containing protein 54
GeneName	WDR54
Length	334
Function	Plays a role in the adhesion and fusion of the sperm-oocyte membrane through its interactions with IZUMO1 and IZUMO1R/JUNO (By similarity). When cross-linked to form dimers and trimers, it has a regulatory effect on ERK signaling pathway activity in response to EGF stimulation. Colocalizes with the EGF receptor in WDR54-specific vesicle where it sustains the internalization and controls the degradation of the EGF receptor after EGF stimulation (PubMed:30458214).
