UniprotID	Q86U90
Accession	Q86U90;Q4W4X8;Q6NVW3;Q7L4E4;Q7Z2I4;Q9H5F8
EntryName	YRDC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Threonylcarbamoyl-AMP synthase (EC 2.7.7.87) (Dopamine receptor-interacting protein 3) (Ischemia/reperfusion-inducible protein homolog) (hIRIP)
GeneName	YRDC DRIP3 IRIP
Length	279
Function	Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial threonylcarbamoyl-AMP synthase required for the formation of a threonylcarbamoyl group on adenosine at position 37 (t(6)A37) in tRNAs that read codons beginning with adenine (PubMed:29760464, PubMed:31481669, PubMed:34545459). Catalyzes the conversion of L-threonine, HCO(3)(-)/CO(2) and ATP to give threonylcarbamoyl-AMP (TC-AMP) as the acyladenylate intermediate, with the release of diphosphate (PubMed:29760464). Participates in t(6)A37 formation in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs (PubMed:29760464). May regulate the activity of some transporters (By similarity).
