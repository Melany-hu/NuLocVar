UniprotID	Q9HCU9
Accession	Q9HCU9;Q6IAI2
EntryName	BRMS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Breast cancer metastasis-suppressor 1
GeneName	BRMS1
Length	246
Function	Transcriptional repressor. Down-regulates transcription activation by NF-kappa-B by promoting the deacetylation of RELA at 'Lys-310'. Promotes HDAC1 binding to promoter regions. Down-regulates expression of anti-apoptotic genes that are controlled by NF-kappa-B. Promotes apoptosis in cells that have inadequate adherence to a substrate, a process called anoikis, and may thereby inhibit metastasis. May be a mediator of metastasis suppression in breast carcinoma.
