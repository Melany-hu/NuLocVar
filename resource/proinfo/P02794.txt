UniprotID	P02794
Accession	P02794;B3KNR5;Q3KRA8;Q3SWW1
EntryName	FRIH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ferritin heavy chain (Ferritin H subunit) (EC 1.16.3.1) (Cell proliferation-inducing gene 15 protein) [Cleaved into: Ferritin heavy chain, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	FTH1 FTH FTHL6 OK/SW-cl.84 PIG15
Length	183
Function	Stores iron in a soluble, non-toxic, readily available form. Important for iron homeostasis. Has ferroxidase activity (PubMed:9003196). Iron is taken up in the ferrous form and deposited as ferric hydroxides after oxidation (PubMed:9003196). Also plays a role in delivery of iron to cells (By similarity). Mediates iron uptake in capsule cells of the developing kidney (By similarity). Delivery to lysosomes is mediated by the cargo receptor NCOA4 for autophagic degradation and release of iron (PubMed:24695223, PubMed:26436293).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Lysosome; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome
