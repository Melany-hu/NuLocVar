UniprotID	P27169
Accession	P27169;B2RA40;Q16052;Q6B0J6;Q9UCB1
EntryName	PON1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON 1) (EC 3.1.1.2) (EC 3.1.1.81) (EC 3.1.8.1) (Aromatic esterase 1) (A-esterase 1) (K-45) (Serum aryldialkylphosphatase 1)
GeneName	PON1 PON
Length	355
Function	Hydrolyzes the toxic metabolites of a variety of organophosphorus insecticides. Capable of hydrolyzing a broad spectrum of organophosphate substrates and lactones, and a number of aromatic carboxylic acid esters. Mediates an enzymatic protection of low density lipoproteins against oxidative modification and the consequent series of events leading to atheroma formation.
