UniprotID	P26718
Accession	P26718;A8K7K5;A8K7P4;Q9NR41
EntryName	NKG2D_HUMAN
ProteinName	NKG2-D type II integral membrane protein (Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily K member 1) (NK cell receptor D) (NKG2-D-activating NK receptor) (CD antigen CD314)
GeneName	KLRK1 D12S2489E NKG2D
Length	216
Function	Functions as an activating and costimulatory receptor involved in immunosurveillance upon binding to various cellular stress-inducible ligands displayed at the surface of autologous tumor cells and virus-infected cells. Provides both stimulatory and costimulatory innate immune responses on activated killer (NK) cells, leading to cytotoxic activity. Acts as a costimulatory receptor for T-cell receptor (TCR) in CD8(+) T-cell-mediated adaptive immune responses by amplifying T-cell activation. Stimulates perforin-mediated elimination of ligand-expressing tumor cells. Signaling involves calcium influx, culminating in the expression of TNF-alpha. Participates in NK cell-mediated bone marrow graft rejection. May play a regulatory role in differentiation and survival of NK cells. Binds to ligands belonging to various subfamilies of MHC class I-related glycoproteins including MICA, MICB, RAET1E, RAET1G, RAET1L/ULBP6, ULBP1, ULBP2, ULBP3 (ULBP2>ULBP1>ULBP3) and ULBP4.
