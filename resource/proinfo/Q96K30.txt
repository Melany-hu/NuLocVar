UniprotID	Q96K30
Accession	Q96K30;B3KVZ4;C9JIN1;F8VRG5;Q53GM3;Q96K25
EntryName	RITA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RBPJ-interacting and tubulin-associated protein 1 (RBPJ-interacting and tubulin-associated protein)
GeneName	RITA1 C12orf52 RITA PSEC0043
Length	269
Function	Tubulin-binding protein that acts as a negative regulator of Notch signaling pathway. Shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and mediates the nuclear export of RBPJ/RBPSUH, thereby preventing the interaction between RBPJ/RBPSUH and NICD product of Notch proteins (Notch intracellular domain), leading to down-regulate Notch-mediated transcription. May play a role in neurogenesis.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome
