UniprotID	O15492
Accession	O15492;B2R4M4;Q5VYN9;Q99701
EntryName	RGS16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 16 (RGS16) (A28-RGS14P) (Retinal-specific RGS) (RGS-r) (hRGS-r) (Retinally abundant regulator of G-protein signaling)
GeneName	RGS16 RGSR
Length	202
Function	Regulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades. Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits, thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form (PubMed:11602604, PubMed:18434541). Plays an important role in the phototransduction cascade by regulating the lifetime and effective concentration of activated transducin alpha. May regulate extra and intracellular mitogenic signals (By similarity).
