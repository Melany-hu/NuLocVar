UniprotID	P55212
Accession	P55212;Q9BQE7
EntryName	CASP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caspase-6 (CASP-6) (CSP-6) (EC 3.4.22.59) (Apoptotic protease Mch-2) [Cleaved into: Caspase-6 subunit p18 (Caspase-6 subunit p20); Caspase-6 subunit p11 (Caspase-6 subunit p10)]
GeneName	CASP6 MCH2
Length	293
Function	Cysteine protease that plays essential roles in programmed cell death, axonal degeneration, development and innate immunity (PubMed:19133298, PubMed:22858542, PubMed:27032039, PubMed:28864531, PubMed:30420425, PubMed:32298652, PubMed:8663580). Acts as a non-canonical executioner caspase during apoptosis: localizes in the nucleus and cleaves the nuclear structural protein NUMA1 and lamin A/LMNA thereby inducing nuclear shrinkage and fragmentation (PubMed:11953316, PubMed:17401638, PubMed:8663580, PubMed:9463409). Lamin-A/LMNA cleavage is required for chromatin condensation and nuclear disassembly during apoptotic execution (PubMed:11953316). Acts as a regulator of liver damage by promoting hepatocyte apoptosis: in absence of phosphorylation by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), catalyzes cleavage of BID, leading to cytochrome c release, thereby participating in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (PubMed:32029622). Cleaves PARK7/DJ-1 in cells undergoing apoptosis (By similarity). Involved in intrinsic apoptosis by mediating cleavage of RIPK1 (PubMed:22858542). Furthermore, cleaves many transcription factors such as NF-kappa-B and cAMP response element-binding protein/CREBBP (PubMed:10559921, PubMed:14657026). Cleaves phospholipid scramblase proteins XKR4 and XKR9 (By similarity). In addition to apoptosis, involved in different forms of programmed cell death (PubMed:32298652). Plays an essential role in defense against viruses by acting as a central mediator of the ZBP1-mediated pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis), independently of its cysteine protease activity (PubMed:32298652). PANoptosis is a unique inflammatory programmed cell death, which provides a molecular scaffold that allows the interactions and activation of machinery required for inflammasome/pyroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis (PubMed:32298652). Mechanistically, interacts with RIPK3 and enhances the interaction between RIPK3 and ZBP1, leading to ZBP1-mediated inflammasome activation and cell death (PubMed:32298652). Plays an essential role in axon degeneration during axon pruning which is the remodeling of axons during neurogenesis but not apoptosis (By similarity). Regulates B-cell programs both during early development and after antigen stimulation (By similarity).
