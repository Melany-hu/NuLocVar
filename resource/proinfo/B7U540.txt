ProteinName	Inward rectifier potassium channel 18 (Inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir2.6) (Potassium channel, inwardly rectifying subfamily J member 18)
GeneName	KCNJ18
Length	433
Function	Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium.
