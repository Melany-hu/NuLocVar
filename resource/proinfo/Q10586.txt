UniprotID	Q10586
Accession	Q10586;A2I2P4
EntryName	DBP_HUMAN
ProteinName	D site-binding protein (Albumin D box-binding protein) (Albumin D-element-binding protein) (Tax-responsive enhancer element-binding protein 302) (TaxREB302)
GeneName	DBP
Length	325
Function	This transcriptional activator recognizes and binds to the sequence 5'-RTTAYGTAAY-3' found in the promoter of genes such as albumin, CYP2A4 and CYP2A5. It is not essential for circadian rhythm generation, but modulates important clock output genes. May be a direct target for regulation by the circadian pacemaker component clock. May affect circadian period and sleep regulation.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
