ProteinName	11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (11-DH) (11-beta-HSD1) (EC 1.1.1.146) (7-oxosteroid reductase) (EC 1.1.1.201) (Corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 1) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 26C member 1)
GeneName	HSD11B1 HSD11 HSD11L SDR26C1
Length	292
Function	Controls the reversible conversion of biologically active glucocorticoids such as cortisone to cortisol, and 11-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone in the presence of NADP(H) (PubMed:10497248, PubMed:12460758, PubMed:14973125, PubMed:15152005, PubMed:15280030, PubMed:17593962, PubMed:21453287, PubMed:27927697, PubMed:30902677). Participates in the corticosteroid receptor-mediated anti-inflammatory response, as well as metabolic and homeostatic processes (PubMed:10497248, PubMed:12414862, PubMed:15152005, PubMed:21453287). Plays a role in the secretion of aqueous humor in the eye, maintaining a normotensive, intraocular environment (PubMed:11481269). Bidirectional in vitro, predominantly functions as a reductase in vivo, thereby increasing the concentration of active glucocorticoids (PubMed:10497248, PubMed:11481269, PubMed:12414862, PubMed:12460758). It has broad substrate specificity, besides glucocorticoids, it accepts other steroid and sterol substrates (PubMed:15095019, PubMed:15152005, PubMed:17593962, PubMed:21453287). Interconverts 7-oxo- and 7-hydroxy-neurosteroids such as 7-oxopregnenolone and 7beta-hydroxypregnenolone, 7-oxodehydroepiandrosterone (3beta-hydroxy-5-androstene-7,17-dione) and 7beta-hydroxydehydroepiandrosterone (3beta,7beta-dihydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one), among others (PubMed:17593962). Catalyzes the stereo-specific conversion of the major dietary oxysterol, 7-ketocholesterol (7-oxocholesterol), into the more polar 7-beta-hydroxycholesterol metabolite (PubMed:15095019, PubMed:15152005). 7-oxocholesterol is one of the most important oxysterols, it participates in several events such as induction of apoptosis, accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions, lipid peroxidation, and induction of foam cell formation (PubMed:15095019). Mediates the 7-oxo reduction of 7-oxolithocholate mainly to chenodeoxycholate, and to a lesser extent to ursodeoxycholate, both in its free form and when conjugated to glycine or taurine, providing a link between glucocorticoid activation and bile acid metabolism (PubMed:21453287). Catalyzes the synthesis of 7-beta-25-dihydroxycholesterol from 7-oxo-25-hydroxycholesterol in vitro, which acts as a ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2) and may thereby regulate immune cell migration (PubMed:30902677).
