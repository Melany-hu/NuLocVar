EntryName	SAP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prosaposin (Proactivator polypeptide) [Cleaved into: Saposin-A (Protein A); Saposin-B-Val; Saposin-B (Cerebroside sulfate activator) (CSAct) (Dispersin) (Sphingolipid activator protein 1) (SAP-1) (Sulfatide/GM1 activator); Saposin-C (A1 activator) (Co-beta-glucosidase) (Glucosylceramidase activator) (Sphingolipid activator protein 2) (SAP-2); Saposin-D (Component C) (Protein C)]
GeneName	PSAP GLBA SAP1
Length	524
Function	Saposin-A and saposin-C stimulate the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide by beta-glucosylceramidase (EC 3.2.1.45) and galactosylceramide by beta-galactosylceramidase (EC 3.2.1.46). Saposin-C apparently acts by combining with the enzyme and acidic lipid to form an activated complex, rather than by solubilizing the substrate.
