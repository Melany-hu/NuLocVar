Accession	P02776;Q53X61;Q9UC64;Q9UC65
EntryName	PLF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Platelet factor 4 (PF-4) (C-X-C motif chemokine 4) (Iroplact) (Oncostatin-A) [Cleaved into: Platelet factor 4, short form (Endothelial cell growth inhibitor)]
GeneName	PF4 CXCL4 SCYB4
Length	101
Function	Chemokine released during platelet aggregation that plays a role in different biological processes including hematopoiesis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and activation (PubMed:29930254, PubMed:9531587). Acts via different functional receptors including CCR1, CXCR3A or CXCR3B (PubMed:18174362, PubMed:29930254). Upon interaction with CXCR3A receptor, induces activated T-lymphocytes migration mediated via downstream Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling (PubMed:18174362, PubMed:24469069). Neutralizes the anticoagulant effect of heparin by binding more strongly to heparin than to the chondroitin-4-sulfate chains of the carrier molecule. Plays a role in the inhibition of hematopoiesis and in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence (PubMed:9531587). Chemotactic for neutrophils and monocytes via CCR1 (PubMed:29930254). Inhibits endothelial cell proliferation. In cooperation with toll-like receptor 8/TLR8, induces chromatin remodeling and activates inflammatory gene expression via the TBK1-IRF5 axis (PubMed:35701499). In addition, induces myofibroblast differentiation and collagen synthesis in different precursor cells, including endothelial cells, by stimulating endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (PubMed:34986347). Interacts with thrombomodulin/THBD to enhance the activation of protein C and thus potentiates its anticoagulant activity (PubMed:9395524).
