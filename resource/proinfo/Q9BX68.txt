UniprotID	Q9BX68
Accession	Q9BX68;Q5TCW3
EntryName	HINT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidase HINT2 (EC 3.9.1.-) (HINT-3) (HIT-17kDa) (Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 2, mitochondrial) (HINT-2) (PKCI-1-related HIT protein)
GeneName	HINT2
Length	163
Function	Exhibits adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidase activity, hydrolyzing purine nucleotide phosphoramidates with a single phosphate group such as adenosine 5'monophosphoramidate (AMP-NH2) to yield AMP and NH2 (PubMed:16762638, PubMed:31990367). Hydrolyzes adenosine 5'-O-p-nitrophenylphosphoramidate (AMP-pNA) (PubMed:16762638). Hydrolyzes fluorogenic purine nucleoside tryptamine phosphoramidates in vitro (PubMed:31990367). May be involved in steroid biosynthesis (PubMed:18653718). May play a role in apoptosis (PubMed:16762638).
