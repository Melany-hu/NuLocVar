UniprotID	P0DME0
Accession	P0DME0
EntryName	SETLP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein SETSIP (SET pseudogene protein 18) (SET similar protein) (Similar to SET translocation protein)
GeneName	SETSIP SETP18
Length	292
Function	Plays a role as a transcriptional activator involved in the early stage of somatic cell reprogramming. Promotes the differentiation of protein-induced pluripotent stem (PiPS) cells into endothelial cells and the formation of vascular-like tubes (in vitro). Involved in the transcription induction of vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin) expression. Associates to the VE-cadherin gene promoter.
