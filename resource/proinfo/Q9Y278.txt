UniprotID	Q9Y278
Accession	Q9Y278;Q52LZ1
EntryName	HS3S2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heparan sulfate glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 2 (EC 2.8.2.29) (Heparan sulfate D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase 2) (3-OST-2) (Heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 2) (h3-OST-2)
GeneName	HS3ST2 3OST2 UNQ2442/PRO5004
Length	367
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) to catalyze the transfer of a sulfo group to an N-unsubstituted glucosamine linked to a 2-O-sulfo iduronic acid unit on heparan sulfate (PubMed:9988768). Catalyzes the O-sulfation of glucosamine in GlcA2S-GlcNS (PubMed:9988768). Unlike HS3ST1/3-OST-1, does not convert non-anticoagulant heparan sulfate to anticoagulant heparan sulfate (PubMed:9988768).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
