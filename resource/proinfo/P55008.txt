UniprotID	P55008
Accession	P55008;A8K406;O43904;Q9UIV4;Q9UKS9
EntryName	AIF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF-1) (Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) (Protein G1)
GeneName	AIF1 G1 IBA1
Length	147
Function	Actin-binding protein that enhances membrane ruffling and RAC activation. Enhances the actin-bundling activity of LCP1. Binds calcium. Plays a role in RAC signaling and in phagocytosis. May play a role in macrophage activation and function. Promotes the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and of T-lymphocytes. Enhances lymphocyte migration. Plays a role in vascular inflammation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cell projection; Ruffle membrane; Cell projection; Phagocytic cup
