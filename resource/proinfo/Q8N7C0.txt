UniprotID	Q8N7C0
Accession	Q8N7C0;A2RUN7;Q5T9K5
EntryName	LRC52_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 52 (BK channel auxiliary gamma subunit LRRC52)
GeneName	LRRC52
Length	313
Function	Auxiliary protein of the large-conductance, voltage and calcium-activated potassium channel (BK alpha). Modulates gating properties by producing a marked shift in the BK channel's voltage dependence of activation in the hyperpolarizing direction, and in the absence of calcium. KCNU1 channel auxiliary protein. Modulates KCNU1 gating properties.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
