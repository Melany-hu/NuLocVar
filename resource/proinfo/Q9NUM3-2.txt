EntryName	S39A9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc transporter ZIP9 (Solute carrier family 39 member 9) (Zrt- and Irt-like protein 9) (ZIP-9)
GeneName	SLC39A9 ZIP9 UNQ714/PRO1377
Length	284
Function	Transports zinc ions across cell and organelle membranes into the cytoplasm and regulates intracellular zinc homeostasis (PubMed:19420709, PubMed:25014355, PubMed:28219737). Participates in the zinc ions efflux out of the secretory compartments (PubMed:19420709). Regulates intracellular zinc level, resulting in the enhancement of AKT1 and MAPK3/MAPK1 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation in response to the BCR activation (PubMed:23505453). Also functions as a membrane androgen receptor that mediates, through a G protein, the non-classical androgen signaling pathway, characterized by the activation of MAPK3/MAPK1 (Erk1/2) and transcription factors CREB1 or ATF1 (By similarity). This pathway contributes to CLDN1 and CLDN5 expression and tight junction formation between adjacent Sertoli cells (By similarity). Mediates androgen-induced vascular endothelial cell proliferation through activation of an inhibitory G protein leading to the AKT1 and MAPK3/MAPK1 (Erk1/2) activation which in turn modulate inhibition (phosphorylation) of GSK3B and CCND1 transcription (PubMed:34555425). Moreover, has dual functions as a membrane-bound androgen receptor and as an androgen-dependent zinc transporter both of which are mediated through an inhibitory G protein (Gi) that mediates both MAP kinase and zinc signaling leading to the androgen-dependent apoptotic process (PubMed:25014355, PubMed:28219737).
