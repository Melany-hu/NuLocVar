UniprotID	P52597
Accession	P52597;B3KM84;Q5T0N2;Q96AU2
EntryName	HNRPF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNP F) (Nucleolin-like protein mcs94-1) [Cleaved into: Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	HNRNPF HNRPF
Length	415
Function	Component of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes which provide the substrate for the processing events that pre-mRNAs undergo before becoming functional, translatable mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Plays a role in the regulation of alternative splicing events. Binds G-rich sequences in pre-mRNAs and keeps target RNA in an unfolded state.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleoplasm
