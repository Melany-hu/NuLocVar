Accession	P02810;A2VCM0;A3KN66;A5D902;B2RMW2;Q4VBP2;Q53XA2;Q6P2F6
EntryName	PRPC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Salivary acidic proline-rich phosphoprotein 1/2 (Db-s) (PRP-1/PRP-2) (Parotid acidic protein) (Pa) (Parotid double-band protein) (Parotid isoelectric focusing variant protein) (PIF-S) (Parotid proline-rich protein 1/2) (Pr1/Pr2) (Protein C) [Cleaved into: Salivary acidic proline-rich phosphoprotein 1/2; Salivary acidic proline-rich phosphoprotein 3/4 (Db-F) (PIF-F) (PRP-3/PRP-4) (Protein A); Peptide P-C]
GeneName	PRH1; PRH2
Length	166
Function	PRP's act as highly potent inhibitors of crystal growth of calcium phosphates. They provide a protective and reparative environment for dental enamel which is important for the integrity of the teeth.
