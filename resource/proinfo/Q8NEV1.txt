UniprotID	Q8NEV1
Accession	Q8NEV1
EntryName	CSK23_HUMAN
ProteinName	Casein kinase II subunit alpha 3 (CK II alpha 3) (EC 2.7.11.1) (Casein kinase II alpha 1 polypeptide pseudogene)
GeneName	CSNK2A3 CSNK2A1P
Length	391
Function	Probable catalytic subunit of a constitutively active serine/threonine-protein kinase complex that phosphorylates a large number of substrates containing acidic residues C-terminal to the phosphorylated serine or threonine. Amplification-dependent oncogene; promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by down-regulating expression of the tumor suppressor protein, PML. May play a role in the pathogenesis of the lung cancer development and progression.
