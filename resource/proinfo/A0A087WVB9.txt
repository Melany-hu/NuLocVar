UniprotID	A0A087WVB9
Accession	A0A087WVB9
EntryName	A0A087WVB9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit K (eIF3k) (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 12) (eIF-3 p25)
GeneName	EIF3K EIF3S12 hCG_2040051
Length	185
Function	Component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is required for several steps in the initiation of protein synthesis. The eIF-3 complex associates with the 40S ribosome and facilitates the recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A, eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation. The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression.
