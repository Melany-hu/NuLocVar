EntryName	HABP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Intracellular hyaluronan-binding protein 4 (IHABP-4) (IHABP4) (Hyaluronan-binding protein 4) (Ki-1/57 intracellular antigen)
GeneName	HABP4
Length	413
Function	Ribosome-binding protein that promotes ribosome hibernation, a process during which ribosomes are stabilized in an inactive state and preserved from proteasomal degradation (By similarity). Acts via its association with EEF2/eEF2 factor at the A-site of the ribosome, promoting ribosome stabilization in an inactive state compatible with storage (By similarity). Plays a key role in ribosome hibernation in the mature oocyte by promoting ribosome stabilization (By similarity). Ribosomes, which are produced in large quantities during oogenesis, are stored and translationally repressed in the oocyte and early embryo (By similarity). Also binds RNA, regulating transcription and pre-mRNA splicing (PubMed:14699138, PubMed:16455055, PubMed:19523114, PubMed:21771594). Binds (via C-terminus) to poly(U) RNA (PubMed:19523114). Seems to play a role in PML-nuclear bodies formation (PubMed:28695742). Negatively regulates DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor MEF2C in myocardial cells in response to mechanical stress (By similarity).
