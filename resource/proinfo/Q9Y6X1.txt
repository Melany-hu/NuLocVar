UniprotID	Q9Y6X1
Accession	Q9Y6X1;D3DNI6
EntryName	SERP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1 (Ribosome-attached membrane protein 4)
GeneName	SERP1 RAMP4
Length	66
Function	Interacts with target proteins during their translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Protects unfolded target proteins against degradation during ER stress. May facilitate glycosylation of target proteins after termination of ER stress. May modulate the use of N-glycosylation sites on target proteins.
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
