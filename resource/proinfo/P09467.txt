UniprotID	P09467
Accession	P09467;O75571;Q53F94;Q96E46
EntryName	F16P1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBPase 1) (EC 3.1.3.11) (D-fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase 1) (Liver FBPase)
GeneName	FBP1 FBP
Length	338
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate in the presence of divalent cations, acting as a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis. Plays a role in regulating glucose sensing and insulin secretion of pancreatic beta-cells. Appears to modulate glycerol gluconeogenesis in liver. Important regulator of appetite and adiposity; increased expression of the protein in liver after nutrient excess increases circulating satiety hormones and reduces appetite-stimulating neuropeptides and thus seems to provide a feedback mechanism to limit weight gain.
