ProteinName	Methylsterol monooxygenase 1 (EC 1.14.18.9) (C-4 methylsterol oxidase) (Sterol-C4-methyl oxidase)
GeneName	MSMO1 DESP4 ERG25 SC4MOL
Length	293
Function	Catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, which can be subsequently metabolized to cholesterol (PubMed:21285510, PubMed:23583456, PubMed:26114596, PubMed:28673550). Also involved in drug metabolism, as it can metabolize eldecalcitol (ED-71 or 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-2beta-(3-hydroxypropoxy)-cholecalciferol), a second-generation vitamin D analog, into 1alpha,2beta,25-trihydroxy vitamin D3; this reaction occurs via enzymatic hydroxylation and spontaneous O-dehydroxypropylation (PubMed:26038696).
