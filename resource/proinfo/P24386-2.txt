UniprotID	P24386-2
Accession	P24386;A1L4D2;O43732
EntryName	RAE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rab proteins geranylgeranyltransferase component A 1 (Choroideremia protein) (Rab escort protein 1) (REP-1) (TCD protein)
GeneName	CHM REP1 TCD
Length	110
Function	Substrate-binding subunit of the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase) complex. Binds unprenylated Rab proteins and presents the substrate peptide to the catalytic component B composed of RABGGTA and RABGGTB, and remains bound to it after the geranylgeranyl transfer reaction. The component A is thought to be regenerated by transferring its prenylated Rab back to the donor membrane. Besides, a pre-formed complex consisting of CHM and the Rab GGTase dimer (RGGT or component B) can bind to and prenylate Rab proteins; this alternative pathway is proposed to be the predominant pathway for Rab protein geranylgeranylation.
