UniprotID	Q16873
Accession	Q16873;Q8N6P0;Q9UC73;Q9UD18
EntryName	LTC4S_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4 synthase) (EC 4.4.1.20) (Glutathione S-transferase LTC4) (EC 2.5.1.-) (Leukotriene-C(4) synthase) (Leukotriene-C4 synthase)
GeneName	LTC4S
Length	150
Function	Catalyzes the conjugation of leukotriene A4 with reduced glutathione (GSH) to form leukotriene C4 with high specificity (PubMed:23409838, PubMed:27365393, PubMed:27791009, PubMed:7937884, PubMed:9153254). Can also catalyze the transfer of a glutathionyl group from glutathione (GSH) to 13(S),14(S)-epoxy-docosahexaenoic acid to form maresin conjugate in tissue regeneration 1 (MCTR1), a bioactive lipid mediator that possess potent anti-inflammatory and proresolving actions (PubMed:27791009).
