UniprotID	O14610
Accession	O14610;B2R746;D3DTW5
EntryName	GBGT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(O) subunit gamma-T2 (G gamma-C) (G-gamma-8) (G-gamma-9) (Guanine nucleotide binding protein gamma transducing activity polypeptide 2)
GeneName	GNGT2 GNG8 GNG9 GNGT8
Length	69
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
