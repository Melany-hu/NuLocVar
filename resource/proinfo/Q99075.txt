UniprotID	Q99075
Accession	Q99075;B2R821
EntryName	HBEGF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proheparin-binding EGF-like growth factor [Cleaved into: Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) (HBEGF) (Diphtheria toxin receptor) (DT-R)]
GeneName	HBEGF DTR DTS HEGFL
Length	208
Function	Growth factor that mediates its effects via EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB4. Required for normal cardiac valve formation and normal heart function. Promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation. May be involved in macrophage-mediated cellular proliferation. It is mitogenic for fibroblasts, but not endothelial cells. It is able to bind EGF receptor/EGFR with higher affinity than EGF itself and is a far more potent mitogen for smooth muscle cells than EGF. Also acts as a diphtheria toxin receptor.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Extracellular space; Cell membrane
