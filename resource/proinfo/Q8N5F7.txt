EntryName	NKAP_HUMAN
ProteinName	NF-kappa-B-activating protein
GeneName	NKAP
Length	415
Function	Acts as a transcriptional repressor (PubMed:14550261, PubMed:19409814, PubMed:31587868). Plays a role as a transcriptional corepressor of the Notch-mediated signaling required for T-cell development (PubMed:19409814). Also involved in the TNF and IL-1 induced NF-kappa-B activation. Associates with chromatin at the Notch-regulated SKP2 promoter.
