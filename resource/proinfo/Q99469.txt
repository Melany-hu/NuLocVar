UniprotID	Q99469
Accession	Q99469;B2R8S8
EntryName	STAC_HUMAN
ProteinName	SH3 and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein (Src homology 3 and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein)
GeneName	STAC STAC1
Length	402
Function	Promotes expression of the ion channel CACNA1H at the cell membrane, and thereby contributes to the regulation of channel activity. Plays a minor and redundant role in promoting the expression of calcium channel CACNA1S at the cell membrane, and thereby contributes to increased channel activity. Slows down the inactivation rate of the calcium channel CACNA1C.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Cell membrane; Cell membrane; Sarcolemma
