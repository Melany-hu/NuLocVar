UniprotID	Q9NPB9
Accession	Q9NPB9;B2R9U7
EntryName	ACKR4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Atypical chemokine receptor 4 (C-C chemokine receptor type 11) (C-C CKR-11) (CC-CKR-11) (CCR-11) (CC chemokine receptor-like 1) (CCRL1) (CCX CKR)
GeneName	ACKR4 CCBP2 CCR11 CCRL1 VSHK1
Length	350
Function	Atypical chemokine receptor that controls chemokine levels and localization via high-affinity chemokine binding that is uncoupled from classic ligand-driven signal transduction cascades, resulting instead in chemokine sequestration, degradation, or transcytosis. Also known as interceptor (internalizing receptor) or chemokine-scavenging receptor or chemokine decoy receptor. Acts as a receptor for chemokines CCL2, CCL8, CCL13, CCL19, CCL21 and CCL25. Chemokine-binding does not activate G-protein-mediated signal transduction but instead induces beta-arrestin recruitment, leading to ligand internalization. Plays an important role in controlling the migration of immune and cancer cells that express chemokine receptors CCR7 and CCR9, by reducing the availability of CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 through internalization. Negatively regulates CXCR3-induced chemotaxis. Regulates T-cell development in the thymus.
