Accession	Q9P287;B3KP45;Q8ND15;Q96GC4;Q9P288
EntryName	BCCIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	BRCA2 and CDKN1A-interacting protein (P21- and CDK-associated protein 1) (Protein TOK-1)
GeneName	BCCIP TOK1
Length	314
Function	During interphase, required for microtubule organizing and anchoring activities. During mitosis, required for the organization and stabilization of the spindle pole (PubMed:28394342). Isoform 2/alpha is particularly important for the regulation of microtubule anchoring, microtubule stability, spindle architecture and spindle orientation, compared to isoform 1/beta (PubMed:28394342). May promote cell cycle arrest by enhancing the inhibition of CDK2 activity by CDKN1A. May be required for repair of DNA damage by homologous recombination in conjunction with BRCA2. May not be involved in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).
