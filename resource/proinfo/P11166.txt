EntryName	GTR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 1 (Glucose transporter type 1, erythrocyte/brain) (GLUT-1) (HepG2 glucose transporter)
GeneName	SLC2A1 GLUT1
Length	492
Function	Facilitative glucose transporter, which is responsible for constitutive or basal glucose uptake (PubMed:10227690, PubMed:10954735, PubMed:18245775, PubMed:19449892, PubMed:25982116, PubMed:27078104, PubMed:32860739). Has a very broad substrate specificity; can transport a wide range of aldoses including both pentoses and hexoses (PubMed:18245775, PubMed:19449892). Most important energy carrier of the brain: present at the blood-brain barrier and assures the energy-independent, facilitative transport of glucose into the brain (PubMed:10227690). In association with BSG and NXNL1, promotes retinal cone survival by increasing glucose uptake into photoreceptors (By similarity). Required for mesendoderm differentiation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Melanosome; Photoreceptor inner segment
