UniprotID	Q15311
Accession	Q15311;D3DUI0
EntryName	RBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RalA-binding protein 1 (RalBP1) (76 kDa Ral-interacting protein) (Dinitrophenyl S-glutathione ATPase) (DNP-SG ATPase) (EC 7.6.2.2, EC 7.6.2.3) (Ral-interacting protein 1)
GeneName	RALBP1 RLIP RLIP1 RLIP76
Length	655
Function	Multifunctional protein that functions as a downstream effector of RALA and RALB (PubMed:7673236). As a GTPase-activating protein/GAP can inactivate CDC42 and RAC1 by stimulating their GTPase activity (PubMed:7673236). As part of the Ral signaling pathway, may also regulate ligand-dependent EGF and insulin receptors-mediated endocytosis (PubMed:10910768, PubMed:12775724). During mitosis, may act as a scaffold protein in the phosphorylation of EPSIN/EPN1 by the mitotic kinase cyclin B-CDK1, preventing endocytosis during that phase of the cell cycle (PubMed:12775724). During mitosis, also controls mitochondrial fission as an effector of RALA (PubMed:21822277). Recruited to mitochondrion by RALA, acts as a scaffold to foster the mitotic kinase cyclin B-CDK1-mediated phosphorylation and activation of DNM1L (PubMed:21822277).
