UniprotID	P22466
Accession	P22466;Q14413
EntryName	GALA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Galanin peptides [Cleaved into: Galanin; Galanin message-associated peptide (GMAP)]
GeneName	GAL GAL1 GALN GLNN
Length	123
Function	Endocrine hormone of the central and peripheral nervous systems that binds and activates the G protein-coupled receptors GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3. This small neuropeptide may regulate diverse physiologic functions including contraction of smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract, growth hormone and insulin release and adrenal secretion.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
