UniprotID	O60869
Accession	O60869;Q5T5T2;Q9UIM1
EntryName	EDF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endothelial differentiation-related factor 1 (EDF-1) (Multiprotein-bridging factor 1) (MBF1)
GeneName	EDF1
Length	148
Function	Transcriptional coactivator stimulating NR5A1 and ligand-dependent NR1H3/LXRA and PPARG transcriptional activities. Enhances the DNA-binding activity of ATF1, ATF2, CREB1 and NR5A1. Regulates nitric oxid synthase activity probably by sequestering calmodulin in the cytoplasm. May function in endothelial cells differentiation, hormone-induced cardiomyocytes hypertrophy and lipid metabolism.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus
