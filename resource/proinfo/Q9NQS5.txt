UniprotID	Q9NQS5
Accession	Q9NQS5;B6V9G7
EntryName	GPR84_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 84 (Inflammation-related G-protein coupled receptor EX33)
GeneName	GPR84 EX33
Length	396
Function	G protein-coupled receptor that responds endogenously to dietary fatty acids or nutrient, specifically medium-chain free fatty acid (FFA) with carbon chain lengths of C9 to C14. Capric acid (C10:0), undecanoic acid (C11:0) and lauric acid (C12:0) are the most potent agonists (PubMed:16966319). In immune cells, functions as a pro-inflammatory receptor via 6-OAU and promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNFalpha, IL-6 and IL-12B as well as stimulating chemotactic responses through activation of signaling mediators AKT, ERK and NF-kappa-B (By similarity). In addition, triggers increased bacterial adhesion and phagocytosis in macrophages and regulates pro-inflammatory function via enhancing NLRP3 inflammasome activation (By similarity). Also plays an important role in inflammation by modulating neutrophil functions (By similarity). Mechanistically, promotes neutrophil chemotaxis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and degranulation via LYN-AKT/ERK pathway (By similarity). To regulate ROS, communicates with the two formyl peptide receptors FPR2 and FPR1 to control the NADPH oxidase activity in neutrophils (PubMed:33789297).
