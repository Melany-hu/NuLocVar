UniprotID	Q99928
Accession	Q99928;G3V594;Q9HD46;Q9NYT2
EntryName	GBRG3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit gamma-3 (GABA(A) receptor subunit gamma-3) (GABAAR subunit gamma-3)
GeneName	GABRG3
Length	467
Function	Gamma subunit of the heteropentameric ligand-gated chloride channel gated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain (By similarity). GABA-gated chloride channels, also named GABA(A) receptors (GABAAR), consist of five subunits arranged around a central pore and contain GABA active binding site(s) located at the alpha and beta subunit interface(s) (By similarity). When activated by GABA, GABAARs selectively allow the flow of chloride across the cell membrane down their electrochemical gradient (By similarity).
