UniprotID	P48431
Accession	P48431;Q14537
EntryName	SOX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor SOX-2
GeneName	SOX2
Length	317
Function	Transcription factor that forms a trimeric complex with OCT4 on DNA and controls the expression of a number of genes involved in embryonic development such as YES1, FGF4, UTF1 and ZFP206 (By similarity). Binds to the proximal enhancer region of NANOG (By similarity). Critical for early embryogenesis and for embryonic stem cell pluripotency (PubMed:18035408). Downstream SRRT target that mediates the promotion of neural stem cell self-renewal (By similarity). Keeps neural cells undifferentiated by counteracting the activity of proneural proteins and suppresses neuronal differentiation (By similarity). May function as a switch in neuronal development (By similarity).
