UniprotID	Q92624
Accession	Q92624;A8K862;O95095;Q8WVC9
EntryName	APBP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Amyloid protein-binding protein 2 (Amyloid beta precursor protein-binding protein 2) (APP-BP2) (Protein interacting with APP tail 1)
GeneName	APPBP2 KIAA0228 PAT1
Length	585
Function	Substrate-recognition component of a Cul2-RING (CRL2) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex of the DesCEND (destruction via C-end degrons) pathway, which recognizes a C-degron located at the extreme C terminus of target proteins, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:29775578, PubMed:29779948). The C-degron recognized by the DesCEND pathway is usually a motif of less than ten residues and can be present in full-length proteins, truncated proteins or proteolytically cleaved forms (PubMed:29775578, PubMed:29779948). The CRL2(APPBP2) complex specifically recognizes proteins with a -Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Gly degron at the C-terminus, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:29775578, PubMed:29779948). The CRL2(APPBP2) complex mediates ubiquitination and degradation of truncated SELENOV selenoproteins produced by failed UGA/Sec decoding, which end with a -Arg-Xaa-Xaa-Gly degron (PubMed:26138980). May play a role in intracellular protein transport: may be involved in the translocation of APP along microtubules toward the cell surface (PubMed:9843960).
