Accession	O00748;A0A024R6X1;A8K367;Q16859;Q5MAB8;Q7Z366;Q8IUP4;Q8TCP8
EntryName	EST2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cocaine esterase (EC 3.1.1.84) (Carboxylesterase 2) (CE-2) (hCE-2) (EC 3.1.1.1) (Methylumbelliferyl-acetate deacetylase 2) (EC 3.1.1.56)
GeneName	CES2 ICE
Length	559
Function	Involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics and in the activation of ester and amide prodrugs (PubMed:9169443). Shows high catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of cocaine, 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate, heroin and 6-monoacetylmorphine (PubMed:9169443). Hydrolyzes aspirin, substrates with large alcohol group and small acyl group and endogenous lipids such as triacylglycerol (PubMed:28677105). Converts monoacylglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol. Hydrolyzes of 2-arachidonoylglycerol and prostaglandins (PubMed:21049984).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum lumen
