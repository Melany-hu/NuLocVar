EntryName	SSH2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein phosphatase Slingshot homolog 2 (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.48) (SSH-like protein 2) (SSH-2L) (hSSH-2L)
GeneName	SSH2 KIAA1725 SSH2L
Length	195
Function	Protein phosphatase which regulates actin filament dynamics. Dephosphorylates and activates the actin binding/depolymerizing factor cofilin, which subsequently binds to actin filaments and stimulates their disassembly. Inhibitory phosphorylation of cofilin is mediated by LIMK1, which may also be dephosphorylated and inactivated by this protein (PubMed:11832213). Required for spermatogenesis (By similarity). Involved in acrosome biogenesis, probably by regulating cofilin-mediated actin cytoskeleton remodeling during proacrosomal vesicle fusion and/or Golgi to perinuclear vesicle trafficking (By similarity).
