UniprotID	Q5T280
Accession	Q5T280;Q0D2P6;Q6P469;Q6PGP9;Q6PIJ1;Q6PJV9
EntryName	CI114_HUMAN
ProteinName	Putative methyltransferase C9orf114 (EC 2.1.1.-) (Centromere protein 32) (CENP-32) (Kinetochore-associated protein) (SPOUT domain-containing methyltransferase 1)
GeneName	SPOUT1 C9orf114
Length	376
Function	Required for association of the centrosomes with the poles of the bipolar mitotic spindle during metaphase (PubMed:20813266, PubMed:25657325). Also involved in chromosome alignment (PubMed:20813266). May promote centrosome maturation probably by recruiting A-kinase anchor protein AKAP9 to centrosomes in early mitosis (PubMed:25657325). Binds specifically to miRNA MIR145 hairpin, regulates MIR145 expression at a postranscriptional level (PubMed:28431233).
