UniprotID	B0QYF7
Accession	B0QYF7
EntryName	B0QYF7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myoglobin
GeneName	MB
Length	74
Function	Monomeric heme protein which primary function is to store oxygen and facilitate its diffusion within muscle tissues. Reversibly binds oxygen through a pentacoordinated heme iron and enables its timely and efficient release as needed during periods of heightened demand. Depending on the oxidative conditions of tissues and cells, and in addition to its ability to bind oxygen, it also has a nitrite reductase activity whereby it regulates the production of bioactive nitric oxide. Under stress conditions, like hypoxia and anoxia, it also protects cells against reactive oxygen species thanks to its pseudoperoxidase activity.
