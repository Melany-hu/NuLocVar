UniprotID	Q6P9F5
Accession	Q6P9F5;Q5SRJ6;Q5SS36;Q8TD96
EntryName	TRI40_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM40 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Probable E3 NEDD8-protein ligase) (RING finger protein 35)
GeneName	TRIM40 RNF35
Length	258
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a role in the limitation of the innate immune response (PubMed:21474709, PubMed:29117565). Mediates inhibition of the RLR signaling pathway by ubiquitinating RIGI and IFIH1 receptors, leading to their proteasomal degradation (PubMed:21474709). Also promotes the neddylation of IKBKG/NEMO, stabilizing NFKBIA, and thereby inhibiting of NF-kappa-B nuclear translocation and activation (PubMed:21474709).
