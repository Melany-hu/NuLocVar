EntryName	BMP7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP-7) (Osteogenic protein 1) (OP-1) (Eptotermin alfa)
GeneName	BMP7 OP1
Length	431
Function	Growth factor of the TGF-beta superfamily that plays important role in various biological processes, including embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, neurogenesis and skeletal morphogenesis (PubMed:31208997). Initiates the canonical BMP signaling cascade by associating with type I receptor ACVR1 and type II receptor ACVR2A (PubMed:12667445, PubMed:9748228). Once all three components are bound together in a complex at the cell surface, ACVR2A phosphorylates and activates ACVR1. In turn, ACVR1 propagates signal by phosphorylating SMAD1/5/8 that travel to the nucleus and act as activators and repressors of transcription of target genes (PubMed:12478285). For specific functions such as growth cone collapse in developing spinal neurons and chemotaxis of monocytes, also uses BMPR2 as type II receptor (PubMed:31208997). Can also signal through non-canonical pathways such as P38 MAP kinase signaling cascade that promotes brown adipocyte differentiation through activation of target genes, including members of the SOX family of transcription factors (PubMed:27923061). Promotes the expression of HAMP, this is repressed by its interaction with ERFE (PubMed:30097509).
