UniprotID	Q8N100
Accession	Q8N100
EntryName	ATOH7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor ATOH7 (Atonal bHLH transcription factor 7) (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 13) (bHLHa13) (Protein atonal homolog 7)
GeneName	ATOH7 ATH5 BHLHA13
Length	152
Function	Transcription factor that binds to DNA at the consensus sequence 5'-CAGTG-3' (PubMed:31696227). Dimerization with TCF3 isoform E47 may be required in certain situations (PubMed:31696227). Binds to gene promoters and enhancer elements, and thereby regulates a transcriptional program of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) determinant genes (By similarity). Although the exact mechanism is not certain, retinal transcription regulation by ATOH7 has a role in RGC determination and survival, photoreceptor population development, targeting of RGC axons to the optic nerve and development of the retino-hypothalamic tract (By similarity). Binds to its own promoter and enhancer sequences, suggesting autoregulation of ATOH7 transcription (By similarity). Required for retinal circadian rhythm photoentrainment (By similarity). Plays a role in brainstem auditory signaling and binaural processing (By similarity).
