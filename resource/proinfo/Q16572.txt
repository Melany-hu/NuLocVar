UniprotID	Q16572
Accession	Q16572;B2R7S1
EntryName	VACHT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) (Solute carrier family 18 member 3)
GeneName	SLC18A3 VACHT
Length	532
Function	Electrogenic antiporter that exchanges one cholinergic neurotransmitter, acetylcholine or choline, with two intravesicular protons across the membrane of synaptic vesicles. Uses the electrochemical proton gradient established by the V-type proton-pump ATPase to store neurotransmitters inside the vesicles prior to their release via exocytosis (By similarity) (PubMed:20225888, PubMed:8910293). Determines cholinergic vesicular quantal size at presynaptic nerve terminals in developing neuro-muscular junctions with an impact on motor neuron differentiation and innervation pattern (By similarity). Part of forebrain cholinergic system, regulates hippocampal synapse transmissions that underlie spatial memory formation (By similarity). Can transport serotonin.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane
