UniprotID	Q8NGI8
Accession	Q8NGI8;B9EIS2;Q6IEV4
EntryName	O5AN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Olfactory receptor 5AN1 (Olfactory receptor OR11-244)
GeneName	OR5AN1
Length	311
Function	Odorant receptor for musk, which specifically recognizes muscone, musk xylol, and musk ketone (PubMed:24361078, PubMed:25901328, PubMed:27098692). Ligand-binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via G(s)-class of G alpha protein GNAL, activating adenylyl cyclase (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
