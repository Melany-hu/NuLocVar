UniprotID	Q9NYW7
Accession	Q9NYW7;Q646G8
EntryName	TA2R1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 1 (T2R1) (Taste receptor family B member 7) (TRB7)
GeneName	TAS2R1
Length	299
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
