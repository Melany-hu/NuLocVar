UniprotID	O75828
Accession	O75828;Q6FHP2
EntryName	CBR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carbonyl reductase [NADPH] 3 (EC 1.1.1.184) (NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase 3) (Quinone reductase CBR3) (EC 1.6.5.10) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 21C member 2)
GeneName	CBR3 SDR21C2
Length	277
Function	Catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols (PubMed:18493841). Has low NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase activity. Acts on several orthoquinones, acts as well on non-quinone compounds, such as isatin or on the anticancer drug oracin (PubMed:15537833, PubMed:18493841, PubMed:19841672). Best substrates for CBR3 is 1,2- naphthoquinone, hence could play a role in protection against cytotoxicity of exogenous quinones (PubMed:19841672). Exerts activity toward ortho-quinones but not paraquinones. No endogenous substrate for CBR3 except isatin has been identified (PubMed:19841672).
