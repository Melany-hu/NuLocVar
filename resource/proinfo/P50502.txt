UniprotID	P50502
Accession	P50502;O14999;Q2TU77
EntryName	F10A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hsc70-interacting protein (Hip) (Aging-associated protein 2) (Progesterone receptor-associated p48 protein) (Protein FAM10A1) (Putative tumor suppressor ST13) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-33) (Suppression of tumorigenicity 13 protein)
GeneName	ST13 AAG2 FAM10A1 HIP SNC6
Length	369
Function	One HIP oligomer binds the ATPase domains of at least two HSC70 molecules dependent on activation of the HSC70 ATPase by HSP40. Stabilizes the ADP state of HSC70 that has a high affinity for substrate protein. Through its own chaperone activity, it may contribute to the interaction of HSC70 with various target proteins (By similarity).
