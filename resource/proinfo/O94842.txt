EntryName	TOX4_HUMAN
ProteinName	TOX high mobility group box family member 4 (Epidermal Langerhans cell protein LCP1)
GeneName	TOX4 C14orf92 KIAA0737
Length	621
Function	Transcription factor that modulates cell fate reprogramming from the somatic state to the pluripotent and neuronal fate (By similarity). Component of the PTW/PP1 phosphatase complex, which plays a role in the control of chromatin structure and cell cycle progression during the transition from mitosis into interphase (PubMed:20516061). In liver, controls the expression of hormone-regulated gluconeogenic genes such as G6PC1 and PCK1. This regulation is independent of the insulin receptor activation (By similarity).
