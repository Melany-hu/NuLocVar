UniprotID	O75506
Accession	O75506;Q53XA8;Q7Z5Z3
EntryName	HSBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heat shock factor-binding protein 1 (Nasopharyngeal carcinoma-associated antigen 13) (NPC-A-13)
GeneName	HSBP1 HSF1BP
Length	76
Function	Negative regulator of the heat shock response. Negatively affects HSF1 DNA-binding activity. May have a role in the suppression of the activation of the stress response during the aging process.
