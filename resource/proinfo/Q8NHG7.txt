UniprotID	Q8NHG7
Accession	Q8NHG7
EntryName	SVIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small VCP/p97-interacting protein
GeneName	SVIP
Length	77
Function	Negative regulator of the ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD) of misfolded proteins. It competes with AMFR/gp78 for binding VCP/p97, and inhibits AMFR/gp78-VCP/p97 complex formation that is required for degradation of ERAD substrates (PubMed:17872946). Involved in the regulation of adrenal cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) biosynthesis (PubMed:35042898).
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Cell membrane; Lysosome membrane
