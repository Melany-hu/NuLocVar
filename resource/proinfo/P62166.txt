UniprotID	P62166
Accession	P62166;E9PAY3;P36610;Q9UK26
EntryName	NCS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1) (Frequenin homolog) (Frequenin-like protein) (Frequenin-like ubiquitous protein)
GeneName	NCS1 FLUP FREQ
Length	190
Function	Neuronal calcium sensor, regulator of G protein-coupled receptor phosphorylation in a calcium dependent manner. Directly regulates GRK1 (RHOK), but not GRK2 to GRK5. Can substitute for calmodulin (By similarity). Stimulates PI4KB kinase activity (By similarity). Involved in long-term synaptic plasticity through its interaction with PICK1 (By similarity). May also play a role in neuron differentiation through inhibition of the activity of N-type voltage-gated calcium channel (By similarity).
