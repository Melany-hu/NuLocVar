UniprotID	P53816
Accession	P53816;B2R7Q4;B7XAK5;Q3SYI3;Q9HDD1
EntryName	PLAT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholipase A and acyltransferase 3 (EC 2.3.1.-) (EC 3.1.1.32) (EC 3.1.1.4) (Adipose-specific phospholipase A2) (AdPLA) (Group XVI phospholipase A1/A2) (H-rev 107 protein homolog) (H-REV107) (HREV107-1) (HRAS-like suppressor 1) (HRAS-like suppressor 3) (HRSL3) (HREV107-3) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-65)
GeneName	PLAAT3 HRASLS3 HREV107 PLA2G16
Length	162
Function	Exhibits both phospholipase A1/2 and acyltransferase activities (PubMed:19047760, PubMed:19615464, PubMed:22605381, PubMed:22825852, PubMed:26503625). Shows phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and A2 (PLA2) activity, catalyzing the calcium-independent release of fatty acids from the sn-1 or sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids (PubMed:19047760, PubMed:19615464, PubMed:22605381, PubMed:22825852, PubMed:22923616). For most substrates, PLA1 activity is much higher than PLA2 activity (PubMed:19615464). Shows O-acyltransferase activity,catalyzing the transfer of a fatty acyl group from glycerophospholipid to the hydroxyl group of lysophospholipid (PubMed:19615464). Shows N-acyltransferase activity, catalyzing the calcium-independent transfer of a fatty acyl group at the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and other glycerophospholipids to the primary amine of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), forming N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), which serves as precursor for N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) (PubMed:19047760, PubMed:19615464, PubMed:22605381, PubMed:22825852). Exhibits high N-acyltransferase activity and low phospholipase A1/2 activity (PubMed:22825852). Required for complete organelle rupture and degradation that occur during eye lens terminal differentiation, when fiber cells that compose the lens degrade all membrane-bound organelles in order to provide lens with transparency to allow the passage of light. Organelle membrane degradation is probably catalyzed by the phospholipase activity (By similarity).
