UniprotID	Q9HBH9
Accession	Q9HBH9;Q6GPI3;Q9HBH8;Q9UHR0;Q9Y2N6
EntryName	MKNK2_HUMAN
ProteinName	MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (EC 2.7.11.1) (MAP kinase signal-integrating kinase 2) (MAPK signal-integrating kinase 2) (Mnk2)
GeneName	MKNK2 GPRK7 MNK2
Length	465
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase that phosphorylates SFPQ/PSF, HNRNPA1 and EIF4E. May play a role in the response to environmental stress and cytokines. Appears to regulate translation by phosphorylating EIF4E, thus increasing the affinity of this protein for the 7-methylguanosine-containing mRNA cap. Required for mediating PP2A-inhibition-induced EIF4E phosphorylation. Triggers EIF4E shuttling from cytoplasm to nucleus. Isoform 1 displays a high basal kinase activity, but isoform 2 exhibits a very low kinase activity. Acts as a mediator of the suppressive effects of IFNgamma on hematopoiesis. Negative regulator for signals that control generation of arsenic trioxide As(2)O(3)-dependent apoptosis and anti-leukemic responses. Involved in anti-apoptotic signaling in response to serum withdrawal.
