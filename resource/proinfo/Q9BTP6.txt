UniprotID	Q9BTP6
Accession	Q9BTP6;D3DN62
EntryName	ZBED2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger BED domain-containing protein 2
GeneName	ZBED2
Length	218
Function	Transcriptional regulator which has intrinsic repressor activity and which competes with the transcriptional activator IRF1 for binding to the 5'-GAAC-3' consensus sequence in gene promoters (PubMed:32385160). May thereby play a role in keratinocyte differentiation (PubMed:31552090).
