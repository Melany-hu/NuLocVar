UniprotID	P09012
Accession	P09012
EntryName	SNRPA_HUMAN
ProteinName	U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein A (U1 snRNP A) (U1-A) (U1A)
GeneName	SNRPA
Length	282
Function	Component of the spliceosomal U1 snRNP, which is essential for recognition of the pre-mRNA 5' splice-site and the subsequent assembly of the spliceosome. U1 snRNP is the first snRNP to interact with pre-mRNA. This interaction is required for the subsequent binding of U2 snRNP and the U4/U6/U5 tri-snRNP. SNRPA binds stem loop II of U1 snRNA. In a snRNP-free form (SF-A) may be involved in coupled pre-mRNA splicing and polyadenylation process. May bind preferentially to the 5'-UGCAC-3' motif on RNAs.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
