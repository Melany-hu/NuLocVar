EntryName	NUF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kinetochore protein Nuf2 (hNuf2) (hNuf2R) (hsNuf2) (Cell division cycle-associated protein 1)
GeneName	NUF2 CDCA1 NUF2R
Length	464
Function	Acts as a component of the essential kinetochore-associated NDC80 complex, which is required for chromosome segregation and spindle checkpoint activity (PubMed:12438418, PubMed:14654001, PubMed:15062103, PubMed:15235793, PubMed:15239953, PubMed:15548592, PubMed:17535814). Required for kinetochore integrity and the organization of stable microtubule binding sites in the outer plate of the kinetochore (PubMed:15548592). The NDC80 complex synergistically enhances the affinity of the SKA1 complex for microtubules and may allow the NDC80 complex to track depolymerizing microtubules (PubMed:23085020).
