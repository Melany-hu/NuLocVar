UniprotID	Q96EM0
Accession	Q96EM0;Q96LJ5
EntryName	T3HPD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.77) (Trans-L-3-hydroxyproline dehydratase)
GeneName	L3HYPDH C14orf149
Length	354
Function	Catalyzes the dehydration of trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline to Delta(1)-pyrroline-2-carboxylate (Pyr2C). May be required to degrade trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline from the diet and originating from the degradation of proteins such as collagen-IV that contain it.
