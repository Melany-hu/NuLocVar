UniprotID	Q9NP98
Accession	Q9NP98;Q9H1I7
EntryName	MYOZ1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myozenin-1 (Calsarcin-2) (Filamin-, actinin- and telethonin-binding protein) (Protein FATZ)
GeneName	MYOZ1 MYOZ
Length	299
Function	Myozenins may serve as intracellular binding proteins involved in linking Z-disk proteins such as alpha-actinin, gamma-filamin, TCAP/telethonin, LDB3/ZASP and localizing calcineurin signaling to the sarcomere. Plays an important role in the modulation of calcineurin signaling. May play a role in myofibrillogenesis.
