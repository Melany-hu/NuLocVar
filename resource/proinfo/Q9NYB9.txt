Function	Regulator of actin cytoskeleton dynamics underlying cell motility and adhesion. Functions as a component of the WAVE complex, which activates actin nucleating machinery Arp2/3 to drive lamellipodia formation (PubMed:21107423). Acts as a regulator and substrate of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases ABL1 and ABL2 involved in processes linked to cell growth and differentiation. Positively regulates ABL1-mediated phosphorylation of ENAH, which is required for proper polymerization of nucleated actin filaments at the leading edge (PubMed:10498863, PubMed:7590236, PubMed:8649853). Contributes to the regulation of actin assembly at the tips of neuron projections. In particular, controls dendritic spine morphogenesis and may promote dendritic spine specification toward large mushroom-type spines known as repositories of memory in the brain (By similarity). In hippocampal neurons, may mediate actin-dependent BDNF-NTRK2 early endocytic trafficking that triggers dendrite outgrowth (By similarity). Participates in ocular lens morphogenesis, likely by regulating lamellipodia-driven adherens junction formation at the epithelial cell-secondary lens fiber interface (By similarity). Also required for nascent adherens junction assembly in epithelial cells (PubMed:15572692).
