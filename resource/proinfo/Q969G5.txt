UniprotID	Q969G5
Accession	Q969G5
EntryName	CAVN3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caveolae-associated protein 3 (Cavin-3) (Protein kinase C delta-binding protein) (Serum deprivation response factor-related gene product that binds to C-kinase) (hSRBC)
GeneName	CAVIN3 PRKCDBP SRBC
Length	261
Function	Regulates the traffic and/or budding of caveolae (PubMed:19262564). Plays a role in caveola formation in a tissue-specific manner. Required for the formation of caveolae in smooth muscle but not in the lung and heart endothelial cells. Regulates the equilibrium between cell surface-associated and cell surface-dissociated caveolae by promoting the rapid release of caveolae from the cell surface. Plays a role in the regulation of the circadian clock. Modulates the period length and phase of circadian gene expression and also regulates expression and interaction of the core clock components PER1/2 and CRY1/2 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Membrane; Caveola; Cytoplasm; Cytosol
