UniprotID	Q9Y295
Accession	Q9Y295;B2RDS8;Q6FGP8;Q8WW69;Q9UGF2
EntryName	DRG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Developmentally-regulated GTP-binding protein 1 (DRG-1) (Neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 3) (NEDD-3) (Translation factor GTPase DRG1) (TRAFAC GTPase DRG1) (EC 3.6.5.-)
GeneName	DRG1 NEDD3
Length	367
Function	Catalyzes the conversion of GTP to GDP through hydrolysis of the gamma-phosphate bond in GTP (PubMed:23711155, PubMed:29915238, PubMed:37179472). Appears to have an intrinsic GTPase activity that is stimulated by ZC3H15/DFRP1 binding likely by increasing the affinity for the potassium ions (PubMed:23711155). When hydroxylated at C-3 of 'Lys-22' by JMJD7, may bind to RNA and play a role in translation (PubMed:19819225, PubMed:29915238). Binds to microtubules and promotes microtubule polymerization and stability that are required for mitotic spindle assembly during prophase to anaphase transition. GTPase activity is not necessary for these microtubule-related functions (PubMed:28855639).
