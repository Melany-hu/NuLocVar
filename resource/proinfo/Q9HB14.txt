EntryName	KCNKD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Potassium channel subfamily K member 13 (Tandem pore domain halothane-inhibited potassium channel 1) (THIK-1)
GeneName	KCNK13
Length	408
Function	K(+) channel that conducts outward rectifying tonic currents potentiated by purinergic signals (PubMed:24163367, PubMed:25148687, PubMed:30472253, PubMed:38409076). Homo- and heterodimerizes to form functional channels with distinct regulatory and gating properties (PubMed:25148687). Contributes most of K(+) currents at the plasma membrane of resting microglia. Maintains a depolarized membrane potential required for proper ramified microglia morphology and phagocytosis, selectively mediating microglial pruning of presynaptic compartments at hippocampal excitatory synapses (PubMed:38409076). Upon local release of ATP caused by neuronal injury or infection, it is potentiated by P2RY12 and P2RX7 receptor signaling and contributes to ATP-triggered K(+) efflux underlying microglial NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and IL1B release (By similarity) (PubMed:38409076).
