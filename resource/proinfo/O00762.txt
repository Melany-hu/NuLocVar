UniprotID	O00762
Accession	O00762;A6NP33;E1P5N7;G3XAB7
EntryName	UBE2C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 C (EC 2.3.2.23) ((E3-independent) E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme C) (EC 2.3.2.24) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme C) (UbcH10) (Ubiquitin carrier protein C) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase C)
GeneName	UBE2C UBCH10
Length	179
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. In vitro catalyzes 'Lys-11'- and 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination. Acts as an essential factor of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis. Acts by initiating 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitin chains on APC/C substrates, leading to the degradation of APC/C substrates by the proteasome and promoting mitotic exit.
