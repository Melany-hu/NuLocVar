UniprotID	Q12951
Accession	Q12951;Q14518;Q66SR7;Q8N6L8
EntryName	FOXI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Forkhead box protein I1 (Forkhead-related protein FKHL10) (Forkhead-related transcription factor 6) (FREAC-6) (Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 forkhead homolog 3) (HFH-3) (HNF-3/fork-head homolog 3)
GeneName	FOXI1 FKHL10 FREAC6
Length	378
Function	Transcriptional activator required for the development of normal hearing, sense of balance and kidney function. Required for the expression of SLC26A4/PDS, JAG1 and COCH in a subset of epithelial cells and the development of the endolymphatic system in the inner ear. Also required for the expression of SLC4A1/AE1, SLC4A9/AE4, ATP6V1B1 and the differentiation of intercalated cells in the epithelium of distal renal tubules (By similarity).
