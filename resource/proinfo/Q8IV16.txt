UniprotID	Q8IV16
Accession	Q8IV16;Q6P3T2;Q86W15
EntryName	HDBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPI-HBP1) (GPI-anchored HDL-binding protein 1) (High density lipoprotein-binding protein 1)
GeneName	GPIHBP1 HBP1
Length	184
Function	Mediates the transport of lipoprotein lipase LPL from the basolateral to the apical surface of endothelial cells in capillaries (By similarity). Anchors LPL on the surface of endothelial cells in the lumen of blood capillaries (By similarity). Protects LPL against loss of activity, and against ANGPTL4-mediated unfolding (PubMed:27929370, PubMed:29899144). Thereby, plays an important role in lipolytic processing of chylomicrons by LPL, triglyceride metabolism and lipid homeostasis (PubMed:19304573, PubMed:21314738). Binds chylomicrons and phospholipid particles that contain APOA5 (PubMed:17997385, PubMed:19304573). Binds high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and plays a role in the uptake of lipids from HDL (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane; Basolateral cell membrane; Cell membrane
