UniprotID	Q8TBF5
Accession	Q8TBF5;Q9NWZ2
EntryName	PIGX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class X protein (PIG-X)
GeneName	PIGX
Length	258
Function	Essential component of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-mannosyltransferase 1 which transfers the first of the 4 mannoses in the GPI-anchor precursors during GPI-anchor biosynthesis. Probably acts by stabilizing the mannosyltransferase PIGM (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
