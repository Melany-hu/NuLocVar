UniprotID	Q01344
Accession	Q01344;B3IU77;B4E2G0;Q14633;Q15469;Q6ISX9
EntryName	IL5RA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-5 receptor subunit alpha (IL-5 receptor subunit alpha) (IL-5R subunit alpha) (IL-5R-alpha) (IL-5RA) (CDw125) (CD antigen CD125)
GeneName	IL5RA IL5R
Length	420
Function	Cell surface receptor that plays an important role in the survival, differentiation, and chemotaxis of eosinophils (PubMed:9378992). Acts by forming a heterodimeric receptor with CSF2RB subunit and subsequently binding to interleukin-5 (PubMed:1495999, PubMed:22528658). In unstimulated conditions, interacts constitutively with JAK2. Heterodimeric receptor activation leads to JAK2 stimulation and subsequent activation of the JAK-STAT pathway (PubMed:9516124).
