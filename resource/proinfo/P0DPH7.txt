ProteinName	Tubulin alpha-3C chain (EC 3.6.5.-) (Alpha-tubulin 2) (Alpha-tubulin 3C) (Tubulin alpha-2 chain) [Cleaved into: Detyrosinated tubulin alpha-3C chain]
GeneName	TUBA3C TUBA2
Length	450
Function	Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules, a cylinder consisting of laterally associated linear protofilaments composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers. Microtubules grow by the addition of GTP-tubulin dimers to the microtubule end, where a stabilizing cap forms. Below the cap, tubulin dimers are in GDP-bound state, owing to GTPase activity of alpha-tubulin.
