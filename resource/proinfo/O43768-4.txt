EntryName	ENSA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-endosulfine (ARPP-19e)
GeneName	ENSA
Length	140
Function	Protein phosphatase inhibitor that specifically inhibits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) during mitosis. When phosphorylated at Ser-67 during mitosis, specifically interacts with PPP2R2D (PR55-delta) and inhibits its activity, leading to inactivation of PP2A, an essential condition to keep cyclin-B1-CDK1 activity high during M phase (By similarity). Also acts as a stimulator of insulin secretion by interacting with sulfonylurea receptor (ABCC8), thereby preventing sulfonylurea from binding to its receptor and reducing K(ATP) channel currents.
