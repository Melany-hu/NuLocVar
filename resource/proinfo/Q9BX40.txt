UniprotID	Q9BX40
Accession	Q9BX40;Q6PFW8;Q96LH8
EntryName	LS14B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein LSM14 homolog B (RNA-associated protein 55B) (hRAP55B)
GeneName	LSM14B C20orf40 FAM61B RAP55B
Length	385
Function	mRNA-binding protein essential for female fertility, oocyte meiotic maturation and the assembly of MARDO (mitochondria-associated ribonucleoprotein domain), a membraneless compartment that stores maternal mRNAs in oocytes. Ensures the proper accumulation and clearance of mRNAs essential for oocyte meiotic maturation and the normal progression from Meiosis I to Meiosis II in oocytes. Promotes the translation of some oogenesis-related mRNAs. Regulates the expression and/or localization of some key P-body proteins in oocytes. Essential for the assembly of the primordial follicle in the ovary.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granule
