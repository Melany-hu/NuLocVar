UniprotID	O14626
Accession	O14626;D3DNJ4;Q8IV06
EntryName	GP171_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 171 (G-protein coupled receptor H963)
GeneName	GPR171 H963
Length	319
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for Big LEN, a 16-amino acid neuropeptide produced from the precursor protein, proSAAS (encoded by PCSK1N). Acts through a G(i)-alpha-mediated pathway in response to Big LEN. Big LEN-GPR171 system plays an important role in regulating feeding and metabolism. Also plays a role in modulating fear and anxiety-like behaviors in the basolateral amygdala. Big LEN-GPR171 modulates the mu-type opioid receptor signaling and antinociception (By similarity). Acts as a negative regulator T cell function (PubMed:34615877).
