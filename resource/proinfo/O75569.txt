UniprotID	O75569
Accession	O75569;A8K3I6;Q53G24;Q6X7T5;Q8NDK4
EntryName	PRKRA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase activator A (PKR-associated protein X) (PKR-associating protein X) (Protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase) (Protein kinase, interferon-inducible double-stranded RNA-dependent activator)
GeneName	PRKRA PACT RAX HSD-14 HSD14
Length	313
Function	Activates EIF2AK2/PKR in the absence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), leading to phosphorylation of EIF2S1/EFI2-alpha and inhibition of translation and induction of apoptosis. Required for siRNA production by DICER1 and for subsequent siRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing. Does not seem to be required for processing of pre-miRNA to miRNA by DICER1. Promotes UBC9-p53/TP53 association and sumoylation and phosphorylation of p53/TP53 at 'Lys-386' at 'Ser-392' respectively and enhances its activity in a EIF2AK2/PKR-dependent manner (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region; Cytoplasm
