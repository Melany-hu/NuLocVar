UniprotID	Q3B726
Accession	Q3B726;A0PJ45;B7Z724
EntryName	RPA43_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit RPA43 (DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit F) (Twist neighbor protein)
GeneName	POLR1F TWISTNB
Length	338
Function	Component of RNA polymerase I (Pol I), a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which synthesizes ribosomal RNA precursors using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Through its association with RRN3/TIF-IA may be involved in recruitment of Pol I to rDNA promoters.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleolus
