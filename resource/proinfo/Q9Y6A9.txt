Accession	Q9Y6A9;B3KNF8;Q9BVW1;X6R2S6
EntryName	SPCS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal peptidase complex subunit 1 (Microsomal signal peptidase 12 kDa subunit) (SPase 12 kDa subunit)
GeneName	SPCS1 SPC12 HSPC033
Length	169
Function	Component of the signal peptidase complex (SPC) which catalyzes the cleavage of N-terminal signal sequences from nascent proteins as they are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:34388369). Dispensable for SPC enzymatic activity (By similarity).
