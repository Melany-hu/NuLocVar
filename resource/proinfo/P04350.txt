ProteinName	Tubulin beta-4A chain (Tubulin 5 beta) (Tubulin beta-4 chain)
GeneName	TUBB4A TUBB4 TUBB5
Length	444
Function	Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules, a cylinder consisting of laterally associated linear protofilaments composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers. Microtubules grow by the addition of GTP-tubulin dimers to the microtubule end, where a stabilizing cap forms. Below the cap, tubulin dimers are in GDP-bound state, owing to GTPase activity of alpha-tubulin.
