UniprotID	P30989
Accession	P30989;Q9H4H1;Q9H4T5
EntryName	NTR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neurotensin receptor type 1 (NT-R-1) (NTR1) (High-affinity levocabastine-insensitive neurotensin receptor) (NTRH)
GeneName	NTSR1 NTRR
Length	418
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for the tridecapeptide neurotensin (NTS) (PubMed:21725197, PubMed:23140271, PubMed:8381365). Signaling is effected via G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Signaling leads to the activation of downstream MAP kinases and protects cells against apoptosis (PubMed:21725197).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Membrane raft
