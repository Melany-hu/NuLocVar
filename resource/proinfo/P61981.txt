EntryName	1433G_HUMAN
ProteinName	14-3-3 protein gamma (Protein kinase C inhibitor protein 1) (KCIP-1) [Cleaved into: 14-3-3 protein gamma, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	YWHAG
Length	247
Function	Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathways (PubMed:15696159, PubMed:16511572, PubMed:36732624). Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif (PubMed:15696159, PubMed:16511572, PubMed:36732624). Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner (PubMed:16511572). Promotes inactivation of WDR24 component of the GATOR2 complex by binding to phosphorylated WDR24 (PubMed:36732624). Participates in the positive regulation of NMDA glutamate receptor activity by promoting the L-glutamate secretion through interaction with BEST1 (PubMed:29121962). Reduces keratinocyte intercellular adhesion, via interacting with PKP1 and sequestering it in the cytoplasm, thereby reducing its incorporation into desmosomes (PubMed:29678907). Plays a role in mitochondrial protein catabolic process (also named MALM) that promotes the degradation of damaged proteins inside mitochondria (PubMed:22532927).
