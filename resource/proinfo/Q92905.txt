EntryName	CSN5_HUMAN
ProteinName	COP9 signalosome complex subunit 5 (SGN5) (Signalosome subunit 5) (EC 3.4.-.-) (Jun activation domain-binding protein 1)
GeneName	COPS5 CSN5 JAB1
Length	334
Function	Probable protease subunit of the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN), a complex involved in various cellular and developmental processes. The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of the SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF-type complexes such as SCF, CSA or DDB2. The complex is also involved in phosphorylation of p53/TP53, c-jun/JUN, IkappaBalpha/NFKBIA, ITPK1 and IRF8, possibly via its association with CK2 and PKD kinases. CSN-dependent phosphorylation of TP53 and JUN promotes and protects degradation by the Ubl system, respectively. In the complex, it probably acts as the catalytic center that mediates the cleavage of Nedd8 from cullins. It however has no metalloprotease activity by itself and requires the other subunits of the CSN complex. Interacts directly with a large number of proteins that are regulated by the CSN complex, confirming a key role in the complex. Promotes the proteasomal degradation of BRSK2.
