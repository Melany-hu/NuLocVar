Function	Core component of the MRN complex, which plays a central role in double-strand break (DSB) repair, DNA recombination, maintenance of telomere integrity and meiosis (PubMed:11741547, PubMed:14657032, PubMed:22078559, PubMed:23080121, PubMed:24316220, PubMed:26240375, PubMed:27889449, PubMed:28867292, PubMed:29670289, PubMed:30464262, PubMed:30612738, PubMed:31353207, PubMed:37696958, PubMed:38128537, PubMed:9590181, PubMed:9651580, PubMed:9705271). The MRN complex is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via homologous recombination (HR), an error-free mechanism which primarily occurs during S and G2 phases (PubMed:24316220, PubMed:28867292, PubMed:31353207, PubMed:38128537). The complex (1) mediates the end resection of damaged DNA, which generates proper single-stranded DNA, a key initial steps in HR, and is (2) required for the recruitment of other repair factors and efficient activation of ATM and ATR upon DNA damage (PubMed:24316220, PubMed:27889449, PubMed:28867292, PubMed:36050397, PubMed:38128537). Within the MRN complex, MRE11 possesses both single-strand endonuclease activity and double-strand-specific 3'-5' exonuclease activity (PubMed:11741547, PubMed:22078559, PubMed:24316220, PubMed:26240375, PubMed:27889449, PubMed:29670289, PubMed:31353207, PubMed:36563124, PubMed:9590181, PubMed:9651580, PubMed:9705271). After DSBs, MRE11 is loaded onto DSBs sites and cleaves DNA by cooperating with RBBP8/CtIP to initiate end resection (PubMed:27814491, PubMed:27889449, PubMed:30787182). MRE11 first endonucleolytically cleaves the 5' strand at DNA DSB ends to prevent non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and licence HR (PubMed:24316220). It then generates a single-stranded DNA gap via 3' to 5' exonucleolytic degradation to create entry sites for EXO1- and DNA2-mediated 5' to 3' long-range resection, which is required for single-strand invasion and recombination (PubMed:24316220, PubMed:28867292). RBBP8/CtIP specifically promotes the endonuclease activity of MRE11 to clear protein-DNA adducts and generate clean double-strand break ends (PubMed:27814491, PubMed:27889449, PubMed:30787182). MRE11 endonuclease activity is also enhanced by AGER/RAGE (By similarity). The MRN complex is also required for DNA damage signaling via activation of the ATM and ATR kinases: the nuclease activity of MRE11 is not required to activate ATM and ATR (PubMed:14657032, PubMed:15064416, PubMed:15790808, PubMed:16622404). The MRN complex is also required for the processing of R-loops (PubMed:31537797). The MRN complex is involved in the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway induced by DNA damage during tumorigenesis: the MRN complex acts by displacing CGAS from nucleosome sequestration, thereby activating it (By similarity). In telomeres the MRN complex may modulate t-loop formation (PubMed:10888888).
