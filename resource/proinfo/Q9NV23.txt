UniprotID	Q9NV23
Accession	Q9NV23;Q5VUB6;Q9NUW1
EntryName	SAST_HUMAN
ProteinName	S-acyl fatty acid synthase thioesterase, medium chain (EC 3.1.2.14) (Augmented in rheumatoid arthritis 1) (AURA1) (Oleoyl-ACP hydrolase) (Thioesterase 2) (TE2) (Thioesterase II) (Thioesterase domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	OLAH THEDC1
Length	265
Function	Contributes to the release of free fatty acids from fatty acid synthase (FASN). Has broad substrate specificity, giving rise to a range of free fatty acids with chain lengths between 10 and 16 carbon atoms (C10 - C16).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol
