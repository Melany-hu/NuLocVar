UniprotID	Q99626
Accession	Q99626;O00503;Q5VTU7;Q969L8;Q9UD92
EntryName	CDX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein CDX-2 (CDX-3) (Caudal-type homeobox protein 2)
GeneName	CDX2 CDX3
Length	313
Function	Transcription factor which regulates the transcription of multiple genes expressed in the intestinal epithelium (By similarity). Binds to the promoter of the intestinal sucrase-isomaltase SI and activates SI transcription (By similarity). Binds to the DNA sequence 5'-ATAAAAACTTAT-3' in the promoter region of VDR and activates VDR transcription (By similarity). Binds to and activates transcription of LPH (By similarity). Activates transcription of CLDN2 and intestinal mucin MUC2 (By similarity). Binds to the 5'-AATTTTTTACAACACCT-3' DNA sequence in the promoter region of CA1 and activates CA1 transcription (By similarity). Important in broad range of functions from early differentiation to maintenance of the intestinal epithelial lining of both the small and large intestine. Binds preferentially to methylated DNA (PubMed:28473536).
