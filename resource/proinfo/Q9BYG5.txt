UniprotID	Q9BYG5
Accession	Q9BYG5;A2A2A7;Q9Y510
EntryName	PAR6B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Partitioning defective 6 homolog beta (PAR-6 beta) (PAR-6B)
GeneName	PARD6B PAR6B
Length	372
Function	Adapter protein involved in asymmetrical cell division and cell polarization processes. Probably involved in formation of epithelial tight junctions. Association with PARD3 may prevent the interaction of PARD3 with F11R/JAM1, thereby preventing tight junction assembly. The PARD6-PARD3 complex links GTP-bound Rho small GTPases to atypical protein kinase C proteins.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cell membrane; Cell junction; Tight junction
