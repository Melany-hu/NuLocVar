UniprotID	Q8WWG1
Accession	Q8WWG1;A6NIE8
EntryName	NRG4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pro-neuregulin-4, membrane-bound isoform (Pro-NRG4) [Cleaved into: Neuregulin-4 (NRG-4)]
GeneName	NRG4
Length	115
Function	Low affinity ligand for the ERBB4 tyrosine kinase receptor. Concomitantly recruits ERBB1 and ERBB2 coreceptors, resulting in ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the ERBB receptors. Does not bind to the ERBB1, ERBB2 and ERBB3 receptors (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted
