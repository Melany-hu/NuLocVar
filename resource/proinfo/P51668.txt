UniprotID	P51668
Accession	P51668;A6NLF6;A8K786
EntryName	UB2D1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D1 (EC 2.3.2.23) ((E3-independent) E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme D1) (EC 2.3.2.24) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme D1) (Stimulator of Fe transport) (SFT) (UBC4/5 homolog) (UbcH5) (Ubiquitin carrier protein D1) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2(17)KB 1) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-17 kDa 1) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase D1)
GeneName	UBE2D1 SFT UBC5A UBCH5 UBCH5A
Length	147
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins (PubMed:22496338). In vitro catalyzes 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:20061386). Mediates the selective degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins. Functions in the E6/E6-AP-induced ubiquitination of p53/TP53. Mediates ubiquitination of PEX5 and auto-ubiquitination of STUB1, TRAF6 and TRIM63/MURF1 (PubMed:18042044, PubMed:18359941). Ubiquitinates STUB1-associated HSP90AB1 in vitro (PubMed:18042044). Lacks inherent specificity for any particular lysine residue of ubiquitin (PubMed:18042044). Essential for viral activation of IRF3 (PubMed:19854139). Mediates polyubiquitination of CYP3A4 (PubMed:19103148).
