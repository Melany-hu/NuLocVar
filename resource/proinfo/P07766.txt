Accession	P07766;A8K997
EntryName	CD3E_HUMAN
ProteinName	T-cell surface glycoprotein CD3 epsilon chain (T-cell surface antigen T3/Leu-4 epsilon chain) (CD antigen CD3e)
GeneName	CD3E T3E
Length	207
Function	Part of the TCR-CD3 complex present on T-lymphocyte cell surface that plays an essential role in adaptive immune response. When antigen presenting cells (APCs) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), TCR-mediated signals are transmitted across the cell membrane by the CD3 chains CD3D, CD3E, CD3G and CD3Z. All CD3 chains contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in their cytoplasmic domain. Upon TCR engagement, these motifs become phosphorylated by Src family protein tyrosine kinases LCK and FYN, resulting in the activation of downstream signaling pathways (PubMed:2470098). In addition of this role of signal transduction in T-cell activation, CD3E plays an essential role in correct T-cell development. Initiates the TCR-CD3 complex assembly by forming the two heterodimers CD3D/CD3E and CD3G/CD3E. Also participates in internalization and cell surface down-regulation of TCR-CD3 complexes via endocytosis sequences present in CD3E cytosolic region (PubMed:10384095, PubMed:26507128). In addition to its role as a TCR coreceptor, it serves as a receptor for ITPRIPL1. Ligand recognition inhibits T-cell activation by promoting interaction with NCK1, which prevents CD3E-ZAP70 interaction and blocks the ERK-NFkB signaling cascade and calcium influx (PubMed:38614099).
