UniprotID	Q7L5N1
Accession	Q7L5N1;A4D2A3;O15387
EntryName	CSN6_HUMAN
ProteinName	COP9 signalosome complex subunit 6 (SGN6) (Signalosome subunit 6) (JAB1-containing signalosome subunit 6) (MOV34 homolog) (Vpr-interacting protein) (hVIP)
GeneName	COPS6 CSN6 HVIP
Length	327
Function	Component of the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN), a complex involved in various cellular and developmental processes. The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF-type complexes such as SCF, CSA or DDB2. The complex is also involved in phosphorylation of p53/TP53, c-jun/JUN, IkappaBalpha/NFKBIA, ITPK1 and IRF8, possibly via its association with CK2 and PKD kinases. CSN-dependent phosphorylation of TP53 and JUN promotes and protects degradation by the Ubl system, respectively. Has some glucocorticoid receptor-responsive activity. Stabilizes COP1 through reducing COP1 auto-ubiquitination and decelerating COP1 turnover rate, hence regulates the ubiquitination of COP1 targets.
