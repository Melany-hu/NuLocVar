UniprotID	P24903
Accession	P24903;A7KAU6;A7KAU7;A7KAU8;A7KAU9;A7KAV0;Q32MN5;Q8WWJ2
EntryName	CP2F1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 2F1 (EC 1.14.14.1) (CYPIIF1)
GeneName	CYP2F1
Length	491
Function	May be involved in the metabolism of various pneumotoxicants including naphthalene. Is able to dealkylate ethoxycoumarin, propoxycoumarin, and pentoxyresorufin but possesses no activity toward ethoxyresorufin and only trace dearylation activity toward benzyloxyresorufin. Bioactivates 3-methylindole (3MI) by dehydrogenation to the putative electrophile 3-methylene-indolenine.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Microsome membrane
