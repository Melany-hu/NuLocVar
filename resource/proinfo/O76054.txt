UniprotID	O76054
Accession	O76054;B7Z8Q1;F5H3U4;Q53EQ2;Q6PD61;Q9ULN4
EntryName	S14L2_HUMAN
ProteinName	SEC14-like protein 2 (Alpha-tocopherol-associated protein) (TAP) (hTAP) (Squalene transfer protein) (Supernatant protein factor) (SPF)
GeneName	SEC14L2 C22orf6 KIAA1186 KIAA1658
Length	403
Function	Carrier protein. Binds to some hydrophobic molecules and promotes their transfer between the different cellular sites. Binds with high affinity to alpha-tocopherol. Also binds with a weaker affinity to other tocopherols and to tocotrienols. May have a transcriptional activatory activity via its association with alpha-tocopherol. Probably recognizes and binds some squalene structure, suggesting that it may regulate cholesterol biosynthesis by increasing the transfer of squalene to a metabolic active pool in the cell.
