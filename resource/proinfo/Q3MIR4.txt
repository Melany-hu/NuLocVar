UniprotID	Q3MIR4
Accession	Q3MIR4;B3KR84;Q14D00
EntryName	CC50B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cell cycle control protein 50B (P4-ATPase flippase complex beta subunit TMEM30B) (Transmembrane protein 30B)
GeneName	TMEM30B CDC50B
Length	351
Function	Accessory component of a P4-ATPase flippase complex which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled to the transport of aminophospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet of various membranes and ensures the maintenance of asymmetric distribution of phospholipids. Phospholipid translocation also seems to be implicated in vesicle formation and in uptake of lipid signaling molecules. The beta subunit may assist in binding of the phospholipid substrate (Probable). Can mediate the export of alpha subunits ATP8A1, ATP8B1, ATP8B2 and ATP8B4 from the ER to the plasma membrane.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
