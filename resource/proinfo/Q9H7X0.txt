EntryName	NAA60_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-alpha-acetyltransferase 60 (hNaa60) (EC 2.3.1.259) (Histone acetyltransferase type B protein 4) (HAT4) (EC 2.3.1.48) (N-acetyltransferase 15) (N-alpha-acetyltransferase F) (NatF)
GeneName	NAA60 HAT4 NAT15 UNQ2771/PRO7155
Length	242
Function	N-alpha-acetyltransferase that specifically mediates the acetylation of N-terminal residues of the transmembrane proteins, with a strong preference for N-termini facing the cytosol (PubMed:25732826, PubMed:38480682). Displays N-terminal acetyltransferase activity towards a range of N-terminal sequences including those starting with Met-Lys, Met-Val, Met-Ala and Met-Met (PubMed:21750686, PubMed:25732826, PubMed:27320834, PubMed:27550639). Required for normal chromosomal segregation during anaphase (PubMed:21750686). May also show histone acetyltransferase activity; such results are however unclear in vivo and would require additional experimental evidences (PubMed:21981917).
