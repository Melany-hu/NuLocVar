UniprotID	P10412
Accession	P10412;Q4VB25
EntryName	H14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H1.4 (Histone H1b) (Histone H1s-4)
GeneName	H1-4 H1F4 HIST1H1E
Length	219
Function	Histone H1 protein binds to linker DNA between nucleosomes forming the macromolecular structure known as the chromatin fiber. Histones H1 are necessary for the condensation of nucleosome chains into higher-order structured fibers. Also acts as a regulator of individual gene transcription through chromatin remodeling, nucleosome spacing and DNA methylation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
