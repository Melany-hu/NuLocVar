UniprotID	P50226
Accession	P50226;A9QY25;P78393;Q14CJ7
EntryName	ST1A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sulfotransferase 1A2 (ST1A2) (EC 2.8.2.1) (Aryl sulfotransferase 2) (Phenol sulfotransferase 2) (Phenol-sulfating phenol sulfotransferase 2) (P-PST 2)
GeneName	SULT1A2 STP2
Length	295
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) as sulfonate donor to catalyze the sulfate conjugation of catecholamines, phenolic drugs and neurotransmitters. Is also responsible for the sulfonation and activation of minoxidil. Mediates the metabolic activation of carcinogenic N-hydroxyarylamines to DNA binding products and could so participate as modulating factor of cancer risk.
