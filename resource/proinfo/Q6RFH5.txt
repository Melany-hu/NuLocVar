UniprotID	Q6RFH5
Accession	Q6RFH5;A8K8G5;Q9BRC9;Q9H6X8;Q9NVY2
EntryName	WDR74_HUMAN
ProteinName	WD repeat-containing protein 74 (NOP seven-associated protein 1)
GeneName	WDR74 NSA1
Length	385
Function	Regulatory protein of the MTREX-exosome complex involved in the synthesis of the 60S ribosomal subunit (PubMed:26456651). Participates in an early cleavage of the pre-rRNA processing pathway in cooperation with NVL (PubMed:29107693). Required for blastocyst formation, is necessary for RNA transcription, processing and/or stability during preimplantation development (By similarity).
