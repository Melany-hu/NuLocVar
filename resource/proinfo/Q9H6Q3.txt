UniprotID	Q9H6Q3
Accession	Q9H6Q3;A8K648;E1P5U1;E1P5U2;Q5TH27;Q5TH28;Q8WY18;Q96QI4;Q9H135
EntryName	SLAP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Src-like-adapter 2 (Modulator of antigen receptor signaling) (MARS) (Src-like adapter protein 2) (SLAP-2)
GeneName	SLA2 C20orf156 SLAP2
Length	261
Function	Adapter protein, which negatively regulates T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Inhibits T-cell antigen-receptor induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells. May act by linking signaling proteins such as ZAP70 with CBL, leading to a CBL dependent degradation of signaling proteins.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Cytoplasm
