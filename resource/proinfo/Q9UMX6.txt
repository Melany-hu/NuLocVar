UniprotID	Q9UMX6
Accession	Q9UMX6;Q9NU15
EntryName	GUC1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanylyl cyclase-activating protein 2 (GCAP 2) (Guanylate cyclase activator 1B)
GeneName	GUCA1B GCAP2
Length	200
Function	Stimulates two retinal guanylyl cyclases (GCs) GUCY2D and GUCY2F when free calcium ions concentration is low, and inhibits GUCY2D and GUCY2F when free calcium ions concentration is elevated (By similarity). This Ca(2+)-sensitive regulation of GCs is a key event in recovery of the dark state of rod photoreceptors following light exposure (By similarity). May be involved in cone photoreceptor response and recovery of response in bright light (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Photoreceptor inner segment; Cell projection; Cilium; Photoreceptor outer segment
