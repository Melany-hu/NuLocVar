UniprotID	P33316
Accession	P33316;A8K650;B4DPR5;O14785;Q16708;Q16860;Q6FHN1;Q6NSA3;Q96Q81
EntryName	DUT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase, mitochondrial (dUTPase) (EC 3.6.1.23) (dUTP pyrophosphatase)
GeneName	DUT
Length	252
Function	Catalyzes the cleavage of 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate (dUTP) into 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (dUMP) and inorganic pyrophosphate and through its action efficiently prevents uracil misincorporation into DNA and at the same time provides dUMP, the substrate for de novo thymidylate biosynthesis (PubMed:17880943, PubMed:8631816, PubMed:8805593). Inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activity by binding of its N-terminal to PPAR, preventing the latter's dimerization with retinoid X receptor (By similarity). Essential for embryonic development (By similarity).
