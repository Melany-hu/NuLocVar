UniprotID	O43181
Accession	O43181;Q9BS69
EntryName	NDUS4_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 4, mitochondrial (Complex I-18 kDa) (CI-18 kDa) (Complex I-AQDQ) (CI-AQDQ) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 18 kDa subunit)
GeneName	NDUFS4
Length	175
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
