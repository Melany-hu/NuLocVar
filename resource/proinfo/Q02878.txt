EntryName	RL6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein eL6 (60S ribosomal protein L6) (Neoplasm-related protein C140) (Tax-responsive enhancer element-binding protein 107) (TaxREB107)
GeneName	RPL6 TXREB1
Length	288
Function	Component of the large ribosomal subunit (PubMed:12962325, PubMed:23636399, PubMed:25901680, PubMed:25957688, PubMed:32669547).
