EntryName	COQ3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquinone biosynthesis O-methyltransferase, mitochondrial (3-demethylubiquinol 3-O-methyltransferase) (EC 2.1.1.64) (3-demethylubiquinone 3-O-methyltransferase) (EC 2.1.1.-) (Polyprenyldihydroxybenzoate methyltransferase) (EC 2.1.1.114)
GeneName	COQ3 UG0215E05
Length	369
Function	O-methyltransferase required for two non-consecutive steps during ubiquinone biosynthesis (By similarity) (PubMed:10777520, PubMed:38425362). Catalyzes the 2 O-methylation of 3,4-dihydroxy-5-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoic acid into 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoic acid (By similarity) (PubMed:10777520, PubMed:38425362). Also catalyzes the last step of ubiquinone biosynthesis by mediating methylation of 3-demethylubiquinone into ubiquinone (By similarity) (PubMed:38425362). Also able to mediate the methylation of 3-demethylubiquinol-10 into ubiquinol-10 (By similarity) (PubMed:10777520).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
