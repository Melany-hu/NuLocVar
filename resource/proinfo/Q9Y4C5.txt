UniprotID	Q9Y4C5
Accession	Q9Y4C5;D3DNG5;Q2M370;Q9GZN5;Q9UED5;Q9Y6F2
EntryName	CHST2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 2 (EC 2.8.2.-) (Galactose/N-acetylglucosamine/N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase 2) (GST-2) (N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase 1) (GlcNAc6ST-1) (Gn6ST-1)
GeneName	CHST2 GN6ST
Length	530
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) as sulfonate donor to catalyze the transfer of sulfate to position 6 of non-reducing N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues within keratan-like structures on N-linked glycans and within mucin-associated glycans that can ultimately serve as SELL ligands. SELL ligands are present in high endothelial cells (HEVs) and play a central role in lymphocyte homing at sites of inflammation. Participates in biosynthesis of the SELL ligand sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X and in lymphocyte homing to Peyer patches. Has no activity toward O-linked sugars. Its substrate specificity may be influenced by its subcellular location. Sulfates GlcNAc residues at terminal, non-reducing ends of oligosaccharide chains.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane
