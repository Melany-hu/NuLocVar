ProteinName	Omega-hydroxyceramide transacylase (EC 2.3.1.296) (Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	PNPLA1
Length	532
Function	Omega-hydroxyceramide transacylase involved in the synthesis of omega-O-acylceramides (esterified omega-hydroxyacyl-sphingosine; EOS), which are extremely hydrophobic lipids involved in skin barrier formation (PubMed:27751867, PubMed:28248318). Catalyzes the last step of the synthesis of omega-O-acylceramides by transferring linoleic acid from triglycerides to an omega-hydroxyceramide (PubMed:27751867, PubMed:28248318). Omega-O-acylceramides, are required for the biogenesis of lipid lamellae in the stratum corneum and the formation of the cornified lipid envelope which are essential for the epidermis barrier function (PubMed:22246504, PubMed:27751867, PubMed:28248318). These lipids also play a role in keratinocyte differentiation (By similarity). May also act on omega-hydroxylated ultra-long chain fatty acids (omega-OH ULCFA) and acylglucosylceramides (GlcEOS) (By similarity).
