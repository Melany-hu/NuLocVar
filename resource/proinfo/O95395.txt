UniprotID	O95395
Accession	O95395
EntryName	GCNT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-1,3-galactosyl-O-glycosyl-glycoprotein beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 3 (EC 2.4.1.102) (EC 2.4.1.148) (EC 2.4.1.150) (C2GnT-mucin type) (C2GnT-M) (hC2GnT-M) (Core 2/core 4 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase) (C2/4GnT)
GeneName	GCNT3
Length	438
Function	Glycosyltransferase that can synthesize all known mucin beta 6 N-acetylglucosaminides. Mediates core 2 and core 4 O-glycan branching, 2 important steps in mucin-type biosynthesis. Also has I-branching enzyme activity by converting linear into branched poly-N-acetyllactosaminoglycans, leading to introduce the blood group I antigen during embryonic development.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
