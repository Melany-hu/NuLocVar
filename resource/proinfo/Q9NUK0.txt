Accession	Q9NUK0;Q5JXN8;Q5JXN9;Q5JXP4;Q6UDQ1;Q8IUR4;Q8TAD9;Q8TAF4;Q9H0Z7;Q9UF37
EntryName	MBNL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Muscleblind-like protein 3 (Cys3His CCG1-required protein) (Muscleblind-like X-linked protein) (Protein HCHCR)
GeneName	MBNL3 CHCR MBLX39 MBXL
Length	354
Function	Mediates pre-mRNA alternative splicing regulation. Acts either as activator or repressor of splicing on specific pre-mRNA targets. Inhibits cardiac troponin-T (TNNT2) pre-mRNA exon inclusion but induces insulin receptor (IR) pre-mRNA exon inclusion in muscle. Antagonizes the alternative splicing activity pattern of CELF proteins. May play a role in myotonic dystrophy pathophysiology (DM). Could inhibit terminal muscle differentiation, acting at approximately the time of myogenin induction.
