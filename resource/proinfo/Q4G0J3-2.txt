UniprotID	Q4G0J3-2
Accession	Q4G0J3;B2ZHN6;Q3B7A9;Q9P1S7;Q9Y3Z8
EntryName	LARP7_HUMAN
ProteinName	La-related protein 7 (La ribonucleoprotein domain family member 7) (hLARP7) (P-TEFb-interaction protein for 7SK stability) (PIP7S)
GeneName	LARP7 HDCMA18P
Length	214
Function	RNA-binding protein that specifically binds distinct small nuclear RNA (snRNAs) and regulates their processing and function (PubMed:18249148, PubMed:32017898). Specifically binds the 7SK snRNA (7SK RNA) and acts as a core component of the 7SK ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, thereby acting as a negative regulator of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (PubMed:18249148, PubMed:18483487). The 7SK RNP complex sequesters the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in a large inactive 7SK RNP complex preventing RNA polymerase II phosphorylation and subsequent transcriptional elongation (PubMed:18249148, PubMed:18483487). The 7SK RNP complex also promotes snRNA gene transcription by RNA polymerase II via interaction with the little elongation complex (LEC) (PubMed:28254838). LARP7 specifically binds to the highly conserved 3'-terminal U-rich stretch of 7SK RNA; on stimulation, remains associated with 7SK RNA, whereas P-TEFb is released from the complex (PubMed:18281698, PubMed:18483487). LARP7 also acts as a regulator of mRNA splicing fidelity by promoting U6 snRNA processing (PubMed:32017898). Specifically binds U6 snRNAs and associates with a subset of box C/D RNP complexes: promotes U6 snRNA 2'-O-methylation by facilitating U6 snRNA loading into box C/D RNP complexes (PubMed:32017898). U6 snRNA 2'-O-methylation is required for mRNA splicing fidelity (PubMed:32017898). Binds U6 snRNAs with a 5'-CAGGG-3' sequence motif (PubMed:32017898). U6 snRNA processing is required for spermatogenesis (By similarity).
