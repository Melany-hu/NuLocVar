UniprotID	Q9BRJ7
Accession	Q9BRJ7;Q8NAI2
EntryName	TIRR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tudor-interacting repair regulator protein (NUDT16-like protein 1) (Protein syndesmos)
GeneName	NUDT16L1 SDOS TIRR
Length	211
Function	Key regulator of TP53BP1 required to stabilize TP53BP1 and regulate its recruitment to chromatin (PubMed:28241136). In absence of DNA damage, interacts with the tandem Tudor-like domain of TP53BP1, masking the region that binds histone H4 dimethylated at 'Lys-20' (H4K20me2), thereby preventing TP53BP1 recruitment to chromatin and maintaining TP53BP1 localization to the nucleus (PubMed:28241136). Following DNA damage, ATM-induced phosphorylation of TP53BP1 and subsequent recruitment of RIF1 leads to dissociate NUDT16L1/TIRR from TP53BP1, unmasking the tandem Tudor-like domain and allowing recruitment of TP53BP1 to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:28241136). Binds U8 snoRNA (PubMed:18820299).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
