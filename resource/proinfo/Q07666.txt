EntryName	KHDR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	KH domain-containing, RNA-binding, signal transduction-associated protein 1 (GAP-associated tyrosine phosphoprotein p62) (Src-associated in mitosis 68 kDa protein) (Sam68) (p21 Ras GTPase-activating protein-associated p62) (p68)
GeneName	KHDRBS1 SAM68
Length	443
Function	Recruited and tyrosine phosphorylated by several receptor systems, for example the T-cell, leptin and insulin receptors. Once phosphorylated, functions as an adapter protein in signal transduction cascades by binding to SH2 and SH3 domain-containing proteins. Role in G2-M progression in the cell cycle. Represses CBP-dependent transcriptional activation apparently by competing with other nuclear factors for binding to CBP. Also acts as a putative regulator of mRNA stability and/or translation rates and mediates mRNA nuclear export. Positively regulates the association of constitutive transport element (CTE)-containing mRNA with large polyribosomes and translation initiation. According to some authors, is not involved in the nucleocytoplasmic export of unspliced (CTE)-containing RNA species according to (PubMed:22253824). RNA-binding protein that plays a role in the regulation of alternative splicing and influences mRNA splice site selection and exon inclusion. Binds to RNA containing 5'-UAA-3' as a bipartite motif spaced by more than 15 nucleotides. Binds poly(A). Can regulate CD44 alternative splicing in a Ras pathway-dependent manner (PubMed:26080397). In cooperation with HNRNPA1 modulates alternative splicing of BCL2L1 by promoting splicing toward isoform Bcl-X(S), and of SMN1 (PubMed:17371836, PubMed:20186123). Can regulate alternative splicing of NRXN1 and NRXN3 in the laminin G-like domain 6 containing the evolutionary conserved neurexin alternative spliced segment 4 (AS4) involved in neurexin selective targeting to postsynaptic partners. In a neuronal activity-dependent manner cooperates synergistically with KHDRBS2/SLIM-1 in regulation of NRXN1 exon skipping at AS4. The cooperation with KHDRBS2/SLIM-1 is antagonistic for regulation of NXRN3 alternative splicing at AS4 (By similarity).
