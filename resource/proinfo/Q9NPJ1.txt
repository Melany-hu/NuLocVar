UniprotID	Q9NPJ1
Accession	Q9NPJ1;A8K7B0;D3DW18
EntryName	MKKS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Molecular chaperone MKKS (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 6 protein) (McKusick-Kaufman/Bardet-Biedl syndromes putative chaperonin)
GeneName	MKKS BBS6
Length	570
Function	Probable molecular chaperone that assists the folding of proteins upon ATP hydrolysis (PubMed:20080638). Plays a role in the assembly of BBSome, a complex involved in ciliogenesis regulating transports vesicles to the cilia (PubMed:20080638). May play a role in protein processing in limb, cardiac and reproductive system development. May play a role in cytokinesis (PubMed:28753627).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome; Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Nucleus
