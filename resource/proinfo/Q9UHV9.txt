UniprotID	Q9UHV9
Accession	Q9UHV9;Q9P0P7;Q9UN05
EntryName	PFD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prefoldin subunit 2
GeneName	PFDN2 PFD2 HSPC231
Length	154
Function	Binds specifically to cytosolic chaperonin (c-CPN) and transfers target proteins to it. Binds to nascent polypeptide chain and promotes folding in an environment in which there are many competing pathways for nonnative proteins.
