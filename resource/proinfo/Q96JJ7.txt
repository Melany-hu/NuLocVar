EntryName	TMX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein disulfide-isomerase TMX3 (EC 5.3.4.1) (Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 10) (Thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 3)
GeneName	TMX3 KIAA1830 TXNDC10
Length	454
Function	Probable disulfide isomerase, which participates in the folding of proteins containing disulfide bonds. May act as a dithiol oxidase (PubMed:15623505). Acts as a regulator of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites via its ability to regulate redox signals (PubMed:31304984).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
