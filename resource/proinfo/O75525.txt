UniprotID	O75525
Accession	O75525;Q6NUL8;Q9UPA8
EntryName	KHDR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	KH domain-containing, RNA-binding, signal transduction-associated protein 3 (RNA-binding protein T-Star) (Sam68-like mammalian protein 2) (SLM-2) (Sam68-like phosphotyrosine protein)
GeneName	KHDRBS3 SALP SLM2
Length	346
Function	RNA-binding protein that plays a role in the regulation of alternative splicing and influences mRNA splice site selection and exon inclusion. Binds preferentially to the 5'-UAAA-3' motif in vitro. Binds optimally to RNA containing 5'-UAA-3' as a bipartite motif spaced by more than 15 nucleotides. Binds poly(A). RNA-binding abilities are down-regulated by tyrosine kinase PTK6 (PubMed:10564820, PubMed:19561594, PubMed:26758068). Involved in splice site selection of vascular endothelial growth factor (PubMed:15901763). In vitro regulates CD44 alternative splicing by direct binding to purine-rich exonic enhancer (By similarity). Can regulate alternative splicing of neurexins NRXN1-3 in the laminin G-like domain 6 containing the evolutionary conserved neurexin alternative spliced segment 4 (AS4) involved in neurexin selective targeting to postsynaptic partners such as neuroligins and LRRTM family members (PubMed:26758068). Targeted, cell-type specific splicing regulation of NRXN1 at AS4 is involved in neuronal glutamatergic synapse function and plasticity (By similarity). May regulate expression of KHDRBS2/SLIM-1 in defined brain neuron populations by modifying its alternative splicing (By similarity). Can bind FABP9 mRNA (By similarity). May play a role as a negative regulator of cell growth. Inhibits cell proliferation.
