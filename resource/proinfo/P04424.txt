EntryName	ARLY_HUMAN
ProteinName	Argininosuccinate lyase (ASAL) (EC 4.3.2.1) (Arginosuccinase)
GeneName	ASL
Length	464
Function	Catalyzes the reversible cleavage of L-argininosuccinate to fumarate and L-arginine, an intermediate step reaction in the urea cycle mostly providing for hepatic nitrogen detoxification into excretable urea as well as de novo L-arginine synthesis in nonhepatic tissues (PubMed:11747432, PubMed:11747433, PubMed:22081021, PubMed:2263616, PubMed:9045711). Essential regulator of intracellular and extracellular L-arginine pools. As part of citrulline-nitric oxide cycle, forms tissue-specific multiprotein complexes with argininosuccinate synthase ASS1, transport protein SLC7A1 and nitric oxide synthase NOS1, NOS2 or NOS3, allowing for cell-autonomous L-arginine synthesis while channeling extracellular L-arginine to nitric oxide synthesis pathway (PubMed:22081021).
