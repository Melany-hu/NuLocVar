UniprotID	P40424-2
Accession	P40424;B4DSC1;F5H4U9;Q5T488
EntryName	PBX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (Homeobox protein PBX1) (Homeobox protein PRL)
GeneName	PBX1 PRL
Length	347
Function	Transcription factor which binds the DNA sequence 5'-TGATTGAT-3' as part of a heterodimer with HOX proteins such as HOXA1, HOXA5, HOXB7 and HOXB8 (PubMed:9191052). Binds to the DNA sequence 5'-TGATTGAC-3' in complex with a nuclear factor which is not a class I HOX protein (PubMed:9191052). Has also been shown to bind the DNA sequence 5'-ATCAATCAA-3' cooperatively with HOXA5, HOXB7, HOXB8, HOXC8 and HOXD4 (PubMed:7791786, PubMed:8327485). Acts as a transcriptional activator of PF4 in complex with MEIS1 (PubMed:12609849). Also activates transcription of SOX3 in complex with MEIS1 by binding to the 5'-TGATTGAC-3' consensus sequence (By similarity). In natural killer cells, binds to the NFIL3 promoter and acts as a transcriptional activator of NFIL3, promoting natural killer cell development (By similarity). Plays a role in the cAMP-dependent regulation of CYP17A1 gene expression via its cAMP-regulatory sequence (CRS1) (By similarity). Probably in complex with MEIS2, involved in transcriptional regulation by KLF4 (PubMed:21746878). Acts as a transcriptional activator of NKX2-5 and a transcriptional repressor of CDKN2B (By similarity). Together with NKX2-5, required for spleen development through a mechanism that involves CDKN2B repression (By similarity).
