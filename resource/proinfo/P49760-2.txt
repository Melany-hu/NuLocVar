UniprotID	P49760-2
Accession	P49760;B1AVS9;B5MBX6;Q96CQ0
EntryName	CLK2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity protein kinase CLK2 (EC 2.7.12.1) (CDC-like kinase 2)
GeneName	CLK2
Length	139
Function	Dual specificity kinase acting on both serine/threonine and tyrosine-containing substrates. Phosphorylates serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins of the spliceosomal complex. May be a constituent of a network of regulatory mechanisms that enable SR proteins to control RNA splicing and can cause redistribution of SR proteins from speckles to a diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution. Acts as a suppressor of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glucose output by repressing PPARGC1A transcriptional activity on gluconeogenic genes via its phosphorylation. Phosphorylates PPP2R5B thereby stimulating the assembly of PP2A phosphatase with the PPP2R5B-AKT1 complex leading to dephosphorylation of AKT1. Phosphorylates: PTPN1, SRSF1 and SRSF3. Regulates the alternative splicing of tissue factor (F3) pre-mRNA in endothelial cells. Phosphorylates PAGE4 at several serine and threonine residues and this phosphorylation attenuates the ability of PAGE4 to potentiate the transcriptional activator activity of JUN (PubMed:28289210).
