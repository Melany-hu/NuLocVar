ProteinName	RNA-binding protein Nova-2 (Astrocytic NOVA1-like RNA-binding protein) (Neuro-oncological ventral antigen 2)
GeneName	NOVA2 ANOVA NOVA3
Length	492
Function	Functions to regulate alternative splicing in neurons by binding pre-mRNA in a sequence-specific manner to activate exon inclusion or exclusion (PubMed:32197073). It binds specifically to the sequences 5'-YCAY-3' and regulates splicing in only a subset of regulated exons (PubMed:10811881). Binding to an exonic 5'-YCAY-3' cluster changes the protein complexes assembled on pre-mRNA, blocking U1 snRNP binding and exon inclusion, whereas binding to an intronic 5'-YCAY-3' cluster enhances spliceosome assembly and exon inclusion. With NOVA1, they perform unique biological functions in different brain areas and cell types. Uniquely regulates alternative splicing events of a series of axon guidance related genes during cortical development, being essential for central nervous system development by regulating neural networks wiring. Regulates differentially alternative splicing on the same transcripts expressed in different neurons. This includes functional differences in transcripts expressed in cortical and cerebellar excitatory versus inhibitory neurons where is required for, respectively, development of laminar structure and motor coordination and synapse formation. Also the regulation the regulation of intron retention can sequester the trans-acting splicing factor PTBP2, acting as a variable cis-acting scaffolding platform for PTBP2 across various natural conditions (By similarity).
