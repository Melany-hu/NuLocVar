UniprotID	Q93096
Accession	Q93096;B2R6C8;O00648;Q49A54
EntryName	TP4A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein tyrosine phosphatase type IVA 1 (EC 3.1.3.48) (PTP(CAAXI)) (Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 4a1) (Protein-tyrosine phosphatase of regenerating liver 1) (PRL-1)
GeneName	PTP4A1 PRL1 PTPCAAX1
Length	173
Function	Protein tyrosine phosphatase which stimulates progression from G1 into S phase during mitosis. May play a role in the development and maintenance of differentiating epithelial tissues. Enhances cell proliferation, cell motility and invasive activity, and promotes cancer metastasis.
