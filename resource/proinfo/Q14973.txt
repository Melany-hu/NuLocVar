UniprotID	Q14973
Accession	Q14973;B9EGB6;Q2TU29
EntryName	NTCP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hepatic sodium/bile acid cotransporter (Cell growth-inhibiting gene 29 protein) (Na(+)/bile acid cotransporter) (Na(+)/taurocholate transport protein) (Sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide) (NTCP) (Solute carrier family 10 member 1) (SLC10A1)
GeneName	SLC10A1 NTCP GIG29
Length	349
Function	As a major transporter of conjugated bile salts from plasma into the hepatocyte, it plays a key role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts necessary for the solubilization and absorption of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins (PubMed:14660639, PubMed:24867799, PubMed:34060352, PubMed:8132774). It is strictly dependent on the extracellular presence of sodium (PubMed:14660639, PubMed:24867799, PubMed:34060352, PubMed:8132774). It exhibits broad substrate specificity and transports various bile acids, such as taurocholate, cholate, as well as non-bile acid organic compounds, such as estrone sulfate (PubMed:14660639, PubMed:34060352). Works collaboratively with the ileal transporter (NTCP2), the organic solute transporter (OST), and the bile salt export pump (BSEP), to ensure efficacious biological recycling of bile acids during enterohepatic circulation (PubMed:33222321).
