EntryName	LAG3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein (LAG-3) (CD antigen CD223) [Cleaved into: Secreted lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein (sLAG-3)]
GeneName	LAG3 FDC
Length	525
Function	Lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein: Inhibitory receptor on antigen activated T-cells (PubMed:20421648, PubMed:7805750, PubMed:8647185). Delivers inhibitory signals upon binding to ligands, such as FGL1 (By similarity). FGL1 constitutes a major ligand of LAG3 and is responsible for LAG3 T-cell inhibitory function (By similarity). Following TCR engagement, LAG3 associates with CD3-TCR in the immunological synapse and directly inhibits T-cell activation (By similarity). May inhibit antigen-specific T-cell activation in synergy with PDCD1/PD-1, possibly by acting as a coreceptor for PDCD1/PD-1 (By similarity). Negatively regulates the proliferation, activation, effector function and homeostasis of both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cells (PubMed:20421648, PubMed:7805750, PubMed:8647185). Also mediates immune tolerance: constitutively expressed on a subset of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and contributes to their suppressive function (By similarity). Also acts as a negative regulator of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDCs) activation (By similarity). Binds MHC class II (MHC-II); the precise role of MHC-II-binding is however unclear (PubMed:8647185).
