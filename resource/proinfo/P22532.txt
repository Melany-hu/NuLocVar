UniprotID	P22532
Accession	P22532;A4QN03;A8K5K2;D3DV33;Q5T523;Q96RM3
EntryName	SPR2D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small proline-rich protein 2D (SPR-2D) (Small proline-rich protein II) (SPR-II)
GeneName	SPRR2D
Length	72
Function	Cross-linked envelope protein of keratinocytes. It is a keratinocyte protein that first appears in the cell cytosol, but ultimately becomes cross-linked to membrane proteins by transglutaminase. All that results in the formation of an insoluble envelope beneath the plasma membrane.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
