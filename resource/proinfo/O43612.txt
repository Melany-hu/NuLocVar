UniprotID	O43612
Accession	O43612
EntryName	OREX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hypocretin neuropeptide precursor (Hypocretin) (Hcrt) (Orexin precursor) (Prepro-orexin) (Preprohypocretin) [Cleaved into: Orexin-A (Hypocretin-1) (Hcrt1); Orexin-B (Hypocretin-2) (Hcrt2)]
GeneName	HCRT OX PPORX PPOX
Length	131
Function	Neuropeptides that play a significant role in the regulation of food intake and sleep-wakefulness, possibly by coordinating the complex behavioral and physiologic responses of these complementary homeostatic functions. A broader role in the homeostatic regulation of energy metabolism, autonomic function, hormonal balance and the regulation of body fluids, is also suggested.
Subcellular Location	Rough endoplasmic reticulum; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Synapse
