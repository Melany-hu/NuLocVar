UniprotID	O14508
Accession	O14508;A8K3D1;O14542;O95102;Q9UKS5
EntryName	SOCS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS-2) (Cytokine-inducible SH2 protein 2) (CIS-2) (STAT-induced STAT inhibitor 2) (SSI-2)
GeneName	SOCS2 CIS2 SSI2 STATI2
Length	198
Function	Substrate-recognition component of a cullin-5-RING E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (ECS complex, also named CRL5 complex), which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, such as EPOR and GHR (PubMed:11781573, PubMed:21980433, PubMed:25505247, PubMed:31182716, PubMed:34857742). Specifically recognizes and binds phosphorylated proteins via its SH2 domain, promoting their ubiquitination (PubMed:21980433, PubMed:25505247, PubMed:31182716, PubMed:34857742, PubMed:37816714). The ECS(SOCS2) complex acts as a key regulator of growth hormone receptor (GHR) levels by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of GHR, following GHR phosphorylation by JAK2 (PubMed:21980433, PubMed:25505247, PubMed:34857742). The ECS(SOCS2) also catalyzes ubiquitination and degradation of JAK2-phosphorylated EPOR (PubMed:11781573).
