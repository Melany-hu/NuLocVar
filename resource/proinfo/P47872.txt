ProteinName	Secretin receptor (SCT-R) (SECR)
GeneName	SCTR
Length	440
Function	G protein-coupled receptor activated by secretin (SCT), which is involved in different processes such as regulation of the pH of the duodenal content, food intake and water homeostasis (PubMed:25332973, PubMed:32811827, PubMed:33008599, PubMed:7612008). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and activates cAMP-dependent pathway (PubMed:32811827, PubMed:33008599). Upon binding to secretin, regulates the pH of the duodenum by (1) inhibiting the secretion of gastric acid from the parietal cells of the stomach and (2) stimulating the production of bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) from the ductal cells of the pancreas (By similarity). In addition to regulating the pH of the duodenal content, plays a central role in diet induced thermogenesis: acts as a non-sympathetic brown fat (BAT) activator mediating prandial thermogenesis, which consequentially induces satiation. Mechanistically, secretin released by the gut after a meal binds to secretin receptor (SCTR) in brown adipocytes, activating brown fat thermogenesis by stimulating lipolysis, which is sensed in the brain and promotes satiation. Also able to stimulate lipolysis in white adipocytes. Also plays an important role in cellular osmoregulation by regulating renal water reabsorption. Also plays a role in the central nervous system: required for synaptic plasticity (By similarity).
