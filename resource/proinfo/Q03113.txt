EntryName	GNA12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-12 (G alpha-12) (G-protein subunit alpha-12)
GeneName	GNA12
Length	381
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as modulators or transducers in various transmembrane signaling systems (PubMed:12515866, PubMed:15240885, PubMed:15525651, PubMed:16705036, PubMed:16787920, PubMed:17565996, PubMed:22609986, PubMed:23762476, PubMed:27084452). Activates effector molecule RhoA by binding and activating RhoGEFs (ARHGEF12/LARG) (PubMed:12515866, PubMed:15240885, PubMed:16202387). GNA12-dependent Rho signaling subsequently regulates transcription factor AP-1 (activating protein-1) (By similarity). GNA12-dependent Rho signaling also regulates protein phosphatese 2A activation causing dephosphorylation of its target proteins (PubMed:15525651, PubMed:17565996). Promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis by activating RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway and up-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokine production (PubMed:16705036, PubMed:16787920, PubMed:23762476, PubMed:27084452). Inhibits CDH1-mediated cell adhesion in process independent from Rho activation (PubMed:11976333, PubMed:16787920). Together with NAPA promotes CDH5 localization to plasma membrane (PubMed:15980433). May play a role in the control of cell migration through the TOR signaling cascade (PubMed:22609986).
