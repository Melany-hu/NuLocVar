UniprotID	Q3SY17
Accession	Q3SY17
EntryName	S2552_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide transporter SLC25A52 (Mitochondrial NAD(+) transporter SLC25A52) (Mitochondrial carrier triple repeat protein 2) (Solute carrier family 25 member 52)
GeneName	SLC25A52 MCART2
Length	297
Function	Mitochondrial membrane carrier protein that mediates the import of NAD(+) into mitochondria (PubMed:32906142). Compared to SLC25A51, SLC25A52-mediated transport is not essential for the import of NAD(+) in mitochondria (PubMed:32906142). The transport mechanism, uniport or antiport, its electrogenicity and substrate selectivity, remain to be elucidated.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
