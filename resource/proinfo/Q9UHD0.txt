EntryName	IL19_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-19 (IL-19) (Melanoma differentiation-associated protein-like protein) (NG.1)
GeneName	IL19 ZMDA1
Length	177
Function	Cytokine that functions as an anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic factor (PubMed:34932373). Polarizes adaptive immunity to an anti-inflammatory phenotype through induction of T-helper 2 responses by both down-regulation of IFN-gamma and up-regulation of IL4 and IL13 (PubMed:16365913). Produced by osteocytes, stimulates granulopoiesis and neutrophil formation (By similarity). Exerts its biological effect through a receptor complex consisting of a heterodimer of IL20RA and IL20RB (PubMed:12351624). In turn, activates the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, and importantly, STAT3 (PubMed:11564763).
