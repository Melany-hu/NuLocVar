UniprotID	Q8TDN4-3
Accession	Q8TDN4;B4DK60;Q8N3Y8;Q8NA22;Q9BTG1
EntryName	CABL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	CDK5 and ABL1 enzyme substrate 1 (Interactor with CDK3 1) (Ik3-1)
GeneName	CABLES1 CABLES
Length	136
Function	Cyclin-dependent kinase binding protein. Enhances cyclin-dependent kinase tyrosine phosphorylation by nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, such as that of CDK5 by activated ABL1, which leads to increased CDK5 activity and is critical for neuronal development, and that of CDK2 by WEE1, which leads to decreased CDK2 activity and growth inhibition. Positively affects neuronal outgrowth. Plays a role as a regulator for p53/p73-induced cell death (By similarity).
