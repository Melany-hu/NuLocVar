UniprotID	Q8N335
Accession	Q8N335;A8K9U3;Q14702;Q9BRM5
EntryName	GPD1L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1-like protein (GPD1-L) (EC 1.1.1.8)
GeneName	GPD1L KIAA0089
Length	351
Function	Plays a role in regulating cardiac sodium current; decreased enzymatic activity with resulting increased levels of glycerol 3-phosphate activating the DPD1L-dependent SCN5A phosphorylation pathway, may ultimately lead to decreased sodium current; cardiac sodium current may also be reduced due to alterations of NAD(H) balance induced by DPD1L.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
