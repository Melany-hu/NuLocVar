EntryName	KLF7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Krueppel-like factor 7 (Ubiquitous krueppel-like factor)
GeneName	KLF7 UKLF
Length	302
Function	Transcriptional factor (PubMed:16339272, PubMed:9774444). Plays a critical role in neuronal morphogenesis and survival of sensory neurons (By similarity). Represses the corneal epithelium differentiation (PubMed:28916725). Also acts as a metabolic regulator, by modulating insulin sensitivity in pancreatic beta cells and skeletal muscle cells (PubMed:16339272). Inhibits transcriptional inducers of adipogenesis and has a repressive role in the expression of several adipokines, including leptin (PubMed:16339272).
