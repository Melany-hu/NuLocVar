UniprotID	Q9H3J6
Accession	Q9H3J6;Q8WUC6
EntryName	MTRFR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial translation release factor in rescue
GeneName	MTRFR C12orf65 My030
Length	166
Function	Part of a mitoribosome-associated quality control pathway that prevents aberrant translation by responding to interruptions during elongation (PubMed:33243891). As heterodimer with MTRES1, ejects the unfinished nascent chain and peptidyl transfer RNA (tRNA), respectively, from stalled ribosomes. Recruitment of mitoribosome biogenesis factors to these quality control intermediates suggests additional roles for MTRES1 and MTRF during mitoribosome rescue (PubMed:33243891).
