UniprotID	P21549
Accession	P21549;Q53QU6
EntryName	AGT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alanine--glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) (EC 2.6.1.44) (Serine--pyruvate aminotransferase) (SPT) (EC 2.6.1.51)
GeneName	AGXT AGT1 SPAT
Length	392
Function	Peroxisomal aminotransferase that catalyzes the transamination of glyoxylate to glycine and contributes to the glyoxylate detoxification (PubMed:10960483, PubMed:12777626, PubMed:23229545, PubMed:24055001, PubMed:26149463). Also catalyzes the transamination between L-serine and pyruvate and contributes to gluconeogenesis from the L-serine metabolism (PubMed:10347152).
Subcellular Location	Peroxisome
