EntryName	RPC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC3 (RNA polymerase III subunit C3) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit C) (RNA polymerase III 62 kDa subunit) (RPC62)
GeneName	POLR3C
Length	534
Function	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates (PubMed:20413673, PubMed:33558764, PubMed:33558766, PubMed:34675218, PubMed:35637192). Specific peripheric component of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) which synthesizes small non-coding RNAs including 5S rRNA, snRNAs, tRNAs and miRNAs from at least 500 distinct genomic loci (PubMed:20413673, PubMed:33558764, PubMed:33558766, PubMed:35637192). Part of POLR3C/RPC3-POLR3F/RPC6-POLR3G/RPC7 heterotrimer, coordinates the dynamics of Pol III stalk and clamp modules during the transition from apo to elongation state (PubMed:33558764, PubMed:33558766). Pol III plays a key role in sensing and limiting infection by intracellular bacteria and DNA viruses. Acts as a nuclear and cytosolic DNA sensor involved in innate immune response. Can sense non-self dsDNA that serves as template for transcription into dsRNA. The non-self RNA polymerase III transcripts, such as Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNAs (EBERs) induce type I interferon and NF-kappa-B through the RIG-I pathway (PubMed:19609254, PubMed:19631370). Preferentially binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in a sequence-independent manner (PubMed:21358628).
