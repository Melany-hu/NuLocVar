UniprotID	Q9H672
Accession	Q9H672;A8K1E5;Q6GSJ6;Q7Z4S3
EntryName	ASB7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 7 (ASB-7)
GeneName	ASB7
Length	318
Function	Probable substrate-recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin-Cullin-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Plays a role in spindle dynamics and genome integrity by targeting the mitotic progression protein PSRC1 for proteasomal degradation in a cell cycle-dependent manner (PubMed:27697924). Also participates in meiosis by mediating the proper attachment between kinetochores and microtubules (By similarity).
