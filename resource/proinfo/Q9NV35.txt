UniprotID	Q9NV35
Accession	Q9NV35;A2RUR6;Q32Q27;Q6P2C9
EntryName	NUD15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleotide triphosphate diphosphatase NUDT15 (EC 3.6.1.9) (MutT homolog 2) (MTH2) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 15) (Nudix motif 15) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked to another moiety X hydrolase 15) (Nudix hydrolase 15)
GeneName	NUDT15 MTH2
Length	164
Function	May catalyze the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates including dGTP, dTTP, dCTP, their oxidized forms like 8-oxo-dGTP and the prodrug thiopurine derivatives 6-thio-dGTP and 6-thio-GTP (PubMed:26238318). Could also catalyze the hydrolysis of some nucleoside diphosphate derivatives (PubMed:22556419, PubMed:26238318). Hydrolyzes oxidized nucleosides triphosphates like 8-oxo-dGTP in vitro, but the specificity and efficiency towards these substrates are low. Therefore, the potential in vivo sanitizing role of this enzyme, that would consist in removing oxidatively damaged forms of nucleosides to prevent their incorporation into DNA, is unclear (PubMed:22556419, PubMed:26238318). Through the hydrolysis of thioguanosine triphosphates may participate in the catabolism of thiopurine drugs (PubMed:25108385, PubMed:26238318). May also have a role in DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression by stabilizing PCNA (PubMed:19419956). Exhibits decapping activity towards dpCoA-capped RNAs in vitro (By similarity).
