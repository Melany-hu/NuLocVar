UniprotID	Q8TDB4
Accession	Q8TDB4;Q9BZC3
EntryName	HUMMR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein MGARP (Corneal endothelium-specific protein 1) (CESP-1) (Hypoxia up-regulated mitochondrial movement regulator protein) (Mitochondria-localized glutamic acid-rich protein) (Ovary-specific acidic protein)
GeneName	MGARP C4orf49 CESP1 HUMMR OSAP GS3582
Length	240
Function	Plays a role in the trafficking of mitochondria along microtubules. Regulates the kinesin-mediated axonal transport of mitochondria to nerve terminals along microtubules during hypoxia. Participates in the translocation of TRAK2/GRIF1 from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrion. Also plays a role in steroidogenesis through maintenance of mitochondrial abundance and morphology (By similarity). Plays an inhibitory role during neocortex development by regulating mitochondrial morphology, distribution and motility in neocortical neurons (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion; Mitochondrion outer membrane; Mitochondrion inner membrane
