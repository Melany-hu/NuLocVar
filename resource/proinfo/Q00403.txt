ProteinName	Transcription initiation factor IIB (EC 2.3.1.48) (General transcription factor TFIIB) (S300-II)
GeneName	GTF2B TF2B TFIIB
Length	316
Function	General transcription factor that plays a role in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Involved in the pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation and Pol II recruitment at promoter DNA (PubMed:12931194, PubMed:1517211, PubMed:1876184, PubMed:1946368, PubMed:27193682, PubMed:3029109, PubMed:3818643, PubMed:7601352, PubMed:8413225, PubMed:8515820, PubMed:8516311, PubMed:8516312, PubMed:9420329). Together with the TATA box-bound TBP forms the core initiation complex and provides a bridge between TBP and the Pol II-TFIIF complex (PubMed:8413225, PubMed:8504927, PubMed:8515820, PubMed:8516311, PubMed:8516312). Released from the PIC early following the onset of transcription during the initiation and elongation transition and reassociates with TBP during the next transcription cycle (PubMed:7601352). Associates with chromatin to core promoter-specific regions (PubMed:12931194, PubMed:24441171). Binds to two distinct DNA core promoter consensus sequence elements in a TBP-independent manner; these IIB-recognition elements (BREs) are localized immediately upstream (BREu), 5'-CGCC-3', and downstream (BREd), 5'-T-3', of the TATA box element (PubMed:10619841, PubMed:16230532, PubMed:7675079, PubMed:9420329). Modulates transcription start site selection (PubMed:10318856). Also exhibits autoacetyltransferase activity that contributes to the activated transcription (PubMed:12931194).
