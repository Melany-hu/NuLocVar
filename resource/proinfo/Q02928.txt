ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 4A11 (EC 1.14.14.1) (20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid synthase) (20-HETE synthase) (CYP4AII) (CYPIVA11) (Cytochrome P-450HK-omega) (Cytochrome P450HL-omega) (Fatty acid omega-hydroxylase) (Lauric acid omega-hydroxylase) (Long-chain fatty acid omega-monooxygenase) (EC 1.14.14.80)
GeneName	CYP4A11 CYP4A2
Length	519
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of fatty acids and their oxygenated derivatives (oxylipins) (PubMed:10553002, PubMed:10660572, PubMed:15611369, PubMed:1739747, PubMed:7679927, PubMed:8914854). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR; NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:10553002, PubMed:10660572, PubMed:15611369, PubMed:1739747, PubMed:7679927, PubMed:8914854). Catalyzes predominantly the oxidation of the terminal carbon (omega-oxidation) of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, the catalytic efficiency decreasing in the following order: dodecanoic > tetradecanoic > (9Z)-octadecenoic > (9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoic > hexadecanoic acid (PubMed:10553002, PubMed:10660572). Acts as a major omega-hydroxylase for dodecanoic (lauric) acid in liver (PubMed:15611369, PubMed:1739747, PubMed:7679927, PubMed:8914854). Participates in omega-hydroxylation of (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (arachidonate) to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a signaling molecule acting both as vasoconstrictive and natriuretic with overall effect on arterial blood pressure (PubMed:10620324, PubMed:10660572, PubMed:15611369). Can also catalyze the oxidation of the penultimate carbon (omega-1 oxidation) of fatty acids with lower efficiency (PubMed:7679927). May contribute to the degradation of saturated very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) such as docosanoic acid, by catalyzing successive omega-oxidations to the corresponding dicarboxylic acid, thereby initiating chain shortening (PubMed:18182499). Omega-hydroxylates (9R,10S)-epoxy-octadecanoate stereoisomer (PubMed:15145985). Plays a minor role in omega-oxidation of long-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acids (PubMed:18065749). Has little activity toward prostaglandins A1 and E1 (PubMed:7679927).
