UniprotID	Q13794
Accession	Q13794;B2R4T7;Q8N589
EntryName	APR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1 (PMA-induced protein 1) (Immediate-early-response protein APR) (Protein Noxa)
GeneName	PMAIP1 NOXA
Length	54
Function	Promotes activation of caspases and apoptosis. Promotes mitochondrial membrane changes and efflux of apoptogenic proteins from the mitochondria. Contributes to p53/TP53-dependent apoptosis after radiation exposure. Promotes proteasomal degradation of MCL1. Competes with BAK1 for binding to MCL1 and can displace BAK1 from its binding site on MCL1 (By similarity). Competes with BIM/BCL2L11 for binding to MCL1 and can displace BIM/BCL2L11 from its binding site on MCL1.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
