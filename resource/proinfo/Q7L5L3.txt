UniprotID	Q7L5L3
Accession	Q7L5L3;Q9H652
EntryName	GDPD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysophospholipase D GDPD3 (EC 3.1.4.-) (Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 7) (Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain-containing protein 3)
GeneName	GDPD3 GDE7
Length	318
Function	Hydrolyzes lysoglycerophospholipids to produce lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and the corresponding amines (PubMed:27637550). Shows a preference for 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PAF), lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) and N-acylethanolamine lysophospholipids (PubMed:27637550). Does not display glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity, since it cannot hydrolyze either glycerophosphoinositol or glycerophosphocholine.
