UniprotID	P45973
Accession	P45973;B2R8T9
EntryName	CBX5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chromobox protein homolog 5 (Antigen p25) (Heterochromatin protein 1 homolog alpha) (HP1 alpha)
GeneName	CBX5 HP1A
Length	191
Function	Component of heterochromatin that recognizes and binds histone H3 tails methylated at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me), leading to epigenetic repression. In contrast, it is excluded from chromatin when 'Tyr-41' of histone H3 is phosphorylated (H3Y41ph) (PubMed:19783980). May contribute to the association of heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane by interactions with the lamin-B receptor (LBR) (PubMed:19783980). Involved in the formation of kinetochore through interaction with the MIS12 complex subunit NSL1 (PubMed:19783980, PubMed:20231385). Required for the formation of the inner centromere (PubMed:20231385).
