UniprotID	O60832
Accession	O60832;F5BSB3;O43845;Q96G67;Q9Y505
EntryName	DKC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex subunit DKC1 (EC 5.4.99.-) (CBF5 homolog) (Dyskerin) (Nopp140-associated protein of 57 kDa) (Nucleolar protein NAP57) (Nucleolar protein family A member 4) (snoRNP protein DKC1)
GeneName	DKC1 NOLA4
Length	514
Function	Catalytic subunit of H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (H/ACA snoRNP) complex, which catalyzes pseudouridylation of rRNA (PubMed:25219674, PubMed:32554502). This involves the isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is subsequently attached to C5, instead of the normal N1 (PubMed:25219674). Each rRNA can contain up to 100 pseudouridine ('psi') residues, which may serve to stabilize the conformation of rRNAs. Required for ribosome biogenesis and telomere maintenance (PubMed:19179534, PubMed:25219674). Also required for correct processing or intranuclear trafficking of TERC, the RNA component of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) holoenzyme (PubMed:19179534).
