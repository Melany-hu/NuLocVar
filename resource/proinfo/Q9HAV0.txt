UniprotID	Q9HAV0
Accession	Q9HAV0;B3KMH5;D3DNR8
EntryName	GBB4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-4 (Transducin beta chain 4)
GeneName	GNB4
Length	340
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
