UniprotID	P0C1H6
Accession	P0C1H6;A6NP82
EntryName	H2BFM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type F-M (Histone H2B.s) (H2B/s)
GeneName	H2BW2 H2BFM
Length	154
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
