UniprotID	Q96QS3
Accession	Q96QS3
EntryName	ARX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein ARX (Aristaless-related homeobox)
GeneName	ARX
Length	562
Function	Transcription factor (PubMed:22194193, PubMed:31691806). Binds to specific sequence motif 5'-TAATTA-3' in regulatory elements of target genes, such as histone demethylase KDM5C (PubMed:22194193, PubMed:31691806). Positively modulates transcription of KDM5C (PubMed:31691806). Activates expression of KDM5C synergistically with histone lysine demethylase PHF8 and perhaps in competition with transcription regulator ZNF711; synergy may be related to enrichment of histone H3K4me3 in regulatory elements (PubMed:31691806). Required for normal brain development (PubMed:11889467, PubMed:12379852, PubMed:14722918). Plays a role in neuronal proliferation, interneuronal migration and differentiation in the embryonic forebrain (By similarity). May also be involved in axonal guidance in the floor plate (By similarity).
