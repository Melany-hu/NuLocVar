Function	May negatively regulate the ATPase activity of VCP, an ATP-driven segregase that associates with different cofactors to control a wide variety of cellular processes (PubMed:26475856). As a cofactor of VCP, it may play a role in the transport of CAV1 to lysosomes for degradation (PubMed:21822278, PubMed:23335559). It may also play a role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins (PubMed:19275885). Together with VCP and other cofactors, it may play a role in macroautophagy, regulating for instance the clearance of damaged lysosomes (PubMed:27753622).
