UniprotID	O00622
Accession	O00622;O14934;O43775;Q9BZL7
EntryName	CCN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	CCN family member 1 (Cellular communication network factor 1) (Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61) (Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 10) (IBP-10) (IGF-binding protein 10) (IGFBP-10) (Protein CYR61) (Protein GIG1)
GeneName	CCN1 CYR61 GIG1 IGFBP10
Length	381
Function	Promotes cell proliferation, chemotaxis, angiogenesis and cell adhesion. Appears to play a role in wound healing by up-regulating, in skin fibroblasts, the expression of a number of genes involved in angiogenesis, inflammation and matrix remodeling including VEGA-A, VEGA-C, MMP1, MMP3, TIMP1, uPA, PAI-1 and integrins alpha-3 and alpha-5. CCN1-mediated gene regulation is dependent on heparin-binding. Down-regulates the expression of alpha-1 and alpha-2 subunits of collagen type-1. Promotes cell adhesion and adhesive signaling through integrin alpha-6/beta-1, cell migration through integrin alpha-v/beta-5 and cell proliferation through integrin alpha-v/beta-3.
