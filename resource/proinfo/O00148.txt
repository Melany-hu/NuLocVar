EntryName	DX39A_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX39A (EC 3.6.4.13) (DEAD box protein 39) (Nuclear RNA helicase URH49)
GeneName	DDX39A DDX39
Length	427
Function	Helicase that plays an essential role in mRNA export and is involved in multiple steps in RNA metabolism including alternative splicing (PubMed:33941617, PubMed:38801080). Regulates nuclear mRNA export to the cytoplasm through association with ECD (PubMed:33941617). Also involved in spliceosomal uridine-rich small nuclear RNA (U snRNA) export by stimulating the RNA binding of adapter PHAX (PubMed:39011894). Plays a role in the negative regulation of type I IFN production by increasing the nuclear retention of antiviral transcripts and thus reducing their protein expression (PubMed:32393512). Independently of the interferon pathway, plays an antiviral role against alphaviruses by binding to a 5' conserved sequence element in the viral genomic RNA (PubMed:37949067).
