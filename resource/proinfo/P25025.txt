UniprotID	P25025
Accession	P25025;Q8IUZ1;Q9P2T6;Q9P2T7
EntryName	CXCR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CXC-R2) (CXCR-2) (CDw128b) (GRO/MGSA receptor) (High affinity interleukin-8 receptor B) (IL-8R B) (IL-8 receptor type 2) (CD antigen CD182)
GeneName	CXCR2 IL8RB
Length	360
Function	Receptor for interleukin-8 which is a powerful neutrophil chemotactic factor (PubMed:1891716). Binding of IL-8 to the receptor causes activation of neutrophils. This response is mediated via a G-protein that activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system (PubMed:8662698). Binds to IL-8 with high affinity. Also binds with high affinity to CXCL3, GRO/MGSA and NAP-2.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
