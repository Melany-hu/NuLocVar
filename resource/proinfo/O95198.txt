UniprotID	O95198
Accession	O95198;A6NCM7;B2RD18;B4DFH7;F5H6M3;Q8N484;Q8TBH5
EntryName	KLHL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kelch-like protein 2 (Actin-binding protein Mayven)
GeneName	KLHL2
Length	593
Function	Substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates the ubiquitination of target proteins, such as NPTXR, WNK1, WNK3 and WNK4, leading most often to their proteasomal degradation (PubMed:23838290). The BCR(KLHL2) complex catalyzes ubiquitination and degradation of NPTXR (By similarity). Responsible for degradative ubiquitination of the WNK kinases WNK1, WNK3 and WNK4 (PubMed:23838290). Plays a role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (PubMed:10397770). Promotes growth of cell projections in oligodendrocyte precursors (PubMed:15715669).
