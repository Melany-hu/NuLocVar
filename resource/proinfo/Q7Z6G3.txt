UniprotID	Q7Z6G3
Accession	Q7Z6G3;A2RRG3;H3BTW2;O75547;Q6ZSK0
EntryName	NECA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding protein 2 (EF-hand calcium-binding protein 2) (Neuronal calcium-binding protein 2) (Synaptotagmin-interacting protein 2) (Stip-2)
GeneName	NECAB2 EFCBP2
Length	386
Function	May act as a signaling scaffold protein that senses intracellular calcium. Can modulate ligand-induced internalization of ADORA2A and coupling efficiency of mGluR5/GRM5; for both receptors may regulate signaling activity such as promoting MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) activation.
