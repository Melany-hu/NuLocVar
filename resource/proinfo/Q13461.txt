EntryName	FOXE3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Forkhead box protein E3 (Forkhead-related protein FKHL12) (Forkhead-related transcription factor 8) (FREAC-8)
GeneName	FOXE3 FKHL12 FREAC8
Length	319
Function	Transcription factor that controls lens epithelial cell growth through regulation of proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle (PubMed:22527307, PubMed:25504734). During lens development, controls the ratio of the lens fiber cells to the cells of the anterior lens epithelium by regulating the rate of proliferation and differentiation (By similarity). Controls lens vesicle closure and subsequent separation of the lens vesicle from ectoderm (By similarity). Controls the expression of DNAJB1 in a pathway that is crucial for the development of the anterior segment of the eye (PubMed:27218149).
