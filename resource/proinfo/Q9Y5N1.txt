EntryName	HRH3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histamine H3 receptor (H3R) (HH3R) (G-protein coupled receptor 97)
GeneName	HRH3 GPCR97
Length	445
Function	The H3 subclass of histamine receptors could mediate the histamine signals in CNS and peripheral nervous system. Signals through the inhibition of adenylate cyclase and displays high constitutive activity (spontaneous activity in the absence of agonist). Agonist stimulation of isoform 3 neither modified adenylate cyclase activity nor induced intracellular calcium mobilization.
