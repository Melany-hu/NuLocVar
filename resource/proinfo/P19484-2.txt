UniprotID	P19484-2
Accession	P19484;Q709B3;Q7Z6P9;Q9BRJ5;Q9UJD8
EntryName	TFEB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor EB (Class E basic helix-loop-helix protein 35) (bHLHe35)
GeneName	TFEB BHLHE35
Length	391
Function	Transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, autophagy, lysosomal exocytosis, lipid catabolism, energy metabolism and immune response (PubMed:21617040, PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:25720963, PubMed:30120233, PubMed:31672913, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:32753672, PubMed:35662396, PubMed:36697823, PubMed:36749723, PubMed:37079666). Specifically recognizes and binds E-box sequences (5'-CANNTG-3'); efficient DNA-binding requires dimerization with itself or with another MiT/TFE family member such as TFE3 or MITF (PubMed:1748288, PubMed:19556463, PubMed:29146937). Involved in the cellular response to amino acid availability by acting downstream of MTOR: in the presence of nutrients, TFEB phosphorylation by MTOR promotes its cytosolic retention and subsequent inactivation (PubMed:21617040, PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:25720963, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:32753672, PubMed:35662396, PubMed:36697823). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of MTOR induces TFEB dephosphorylation, resulting in nuclear localization and transcription factor activity (PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22692423, PubMed:25720963, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:32753672, PubMed:35662396, PubMed:36697823). Specifically recognizes and binds the CLEAR-box sequence (5'-GTCACGTGAC-3') present in the regulatory region of many lysosomal genes, leading to activate their expression, thereby playing a central role in expression of lysosomal genes (PubMed:19556463, PubMed:22692423). Regulates lysosomal positioning in response to nutrient deprivation by promoting the expression of PIP4P1 (PubMed:29146937). Acts as a positive regulator of autophagy by promoting expression of genes involved in autophagy (PubMed:21617040, PubMed:22576015, PubMed:23434374, PubMed:27278822). In association with TFE3, activates the expression of CD40L in T-cells, thereby playing a role in T-cell-dependent antibody responses in activated CD4(+) T-cells and thymus-dependent humoral immunity (By similarity). Specifically recognizes the gamma-E3 box, a subset of E-boxes, present in the heavy-chain immunoglobulin enhancer (PubMed:2115126). Plays a role in the signal transduction processes required for normal vascularization of the placenta (By similarity). Involved in the immune response to infection by the bacteria S.aureus, S.typhimurium or S.enterica: infection promotes itaconate production, leading to alkylation, resulting in nuclear localization and transcription factor activity (PubMed:35662396). Itaconate-mediated alkylation activates TFEB-dependent lysosomal biogenesis, facilitating the bacteria clearance during the antibacterial innate immune response (PubMed:35662396). In association with ACSS2, promotes the expression of genes involved in lysosome biogenesis and both autophagy upon glucose deprivation (PubMed:28552616).
