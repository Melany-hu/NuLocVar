Accession	Q6DKK2;A8MZ52;B3KP62;B4DN65;Q2M248;Q7L3U8;Q9H6G3;Q9NXB2
EntryName	TTC19_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tetratricopeptide repeat protein 19, mitochondrial (TPR repeat protein 19)
GeneName	TTC19
Length	380
Function	Required for the preservation of the structural and functional integrity of mitochondrial respiratory complex III by allowing the physiological turnover of the Rieske protein UQCRFS1 (PubMed:21278747, PubMed:28673544). Involved in the clearance of UQCRFS1 N-terminal fragments, which are produced upon incorporation of UQCRFS1 into the complex III and whose presence is detrimental for its catalytic activity (PubMed:28673544).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
