UniprotID	P21453
Accession	P21453;D3DT66;Q9BYY4;Q9NYN8
EntryName	S1PR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P receptor 1) (S1P1) (Endothelial differentiation G-protein coupled receptor 1) (Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor Edg-1) (S1P receptor Edg-1) (CD antigen CD363)
GeneName	S1PR1 CHEDG1 EDG1
Length	382
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for the bioactive lysosphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) that seems to be coupled to the G(i) subclass of heteromeric G proteins. Signaling leads to the activation of RAC1, SRC, PTK2/FAK1 and MAP kinases. Plays an important role in cell migration, probably via its role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of lamellipodia in response to stimuli that increase the activity of the sphingosine kinase SPHK1. Required for normal chemotaxis toward sphingosine 1-phosphate. Required for normal embryonic heart development and normal cardiac morphogenesis. Plays an important role in the regulation of sprouting angiogenesis and vascular maturation. Inhibits sprouting angiogenesis to prevent excessive sprouting during blood vessel development. Required for normal egress of mature T-cells from the thymus into the blood stream and into peripheral lymphoid organs. Plays a role in the migration of osteoclast precursor cells, the regulation of bone mineralization and bone homeostasis (By similarity). Plays a role in responses to oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine by pulmonary endothelial cells and in the protection against ventilator-induced lung injury.
