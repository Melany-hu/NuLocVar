Length	440
Function	Cofactor involved in the regulation of various cellular mechanisms such as actin regulation, autophagy, chromatin regulation and DNA repair (PubMed:18451878, PubMed:31727855). In non-stress conditions, interacts with cofactor JMY in the cytoplasm which prevents JMY's actin nucleation activity and ability to activate the Arp2/3 complex. Acts as a negative regulator of nutrient stress-induced autophagy by preventing JMY's interaction with MAP1LC3B, thereby preventing autophagosome formation (By similarity). Involves in tubulin autoregulation by promoting its degradation in response to excess soluble tubulin (PubMed:31727855). To do so, associates with the active ribosome near the ribosome exit tunnel and with nascent tubulin polypeptides early during their translation, triggering tubulin mRNA-targeted degradation (PubMed:31727855). Following DNA damage, phosphorylated by DNA damage responsive protein kinases ATM and CHEK2, leading to its nuclear accumulation and stability. Nuclear TTC5/STRAP promotes the assembly of a stress-responsive p53/TP53 coactivator complex, which includes the coactivators JMY and p300, thereby increasing p53/TP53-dependent transcription and apoptosis. Also recruits arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 to p53/TP53 when DNA is damaged, allowing PRMT5 to methylate p53/TP53. In DNA stress conditions, also prevents p53/TP53 degradation by E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (By similarity). Upon heat-shock stress, forms a chromatin-associated complex with heat-shock factor 1 HSF1 and p300/EP300 to stimulate heat-shock-responsive transcription, thereby increasing cell survival (PubMed:18451878). Mitochondrial TTC5/STRAP interacts with ATP synthase subunit beta ATP5F1B which decreased ATP synthase activity and lowers mitochondrial ATP production, thereby regulating cellular respiration and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Mitochondrial TTC5/STRAP also regulates p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis (By similarity).
