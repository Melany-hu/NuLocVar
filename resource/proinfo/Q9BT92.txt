UniprotID	Q9BT92
Accession	Q9BT92;Q8NAG0
EntryName	TCHP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trichoplein keratin filament-binding protein (Protein TCHP) (Mitochondrial protein with oncostatic activity) (Mitostatin) (Tumor suppressor protein)
GeneName	TCHP
Length	498
Function	Tumor suppressor which has the ability to inhibit cell growth and be pro-apoptotic during cell stress. Inhibits cell growth in bladder and prostate cancer cells by a down-regulation of HSPB1 by inhibiting its phosphorylation. May act as a 'capping' or 'branching' protein for keratin filaments in the cell periphery. May regulate K8/K18 filament and desmosome organization mainly at the apical or peripheral regions of simple epithelial cells (PubMed:15731013, PubMed:18931701). Is a negative regulator of ciliogenesis (PubMed:25270598).
