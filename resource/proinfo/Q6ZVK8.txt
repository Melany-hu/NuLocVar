UniprotID	Q6ZVK8
Accession	Q6ZVK8;Q8IZ75;Q9H687
EntryName	NUD18_HUMAN
ProteinName	8-oxo-dGDP phosphatase NUDT18 (EC 3.6.1.58) (2-hydroxy-dADP phosphatase) (7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine phosphatase) (MutT homolog 3) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 18) (Nudix motif 18)
GeneName	NUDT18 MTH3
Length	323
Function	Mediates the hydrolysis of oxidized nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. Hydrolyzes 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-Gua)-containing deoxyribo- and ribonucleoside diphosphates to the monophosphates. Hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGDP and 8-oxo-GDP with the same efficiencies. Also hydrolyzes 8-OH-dADP and 2-OH-dADP. Exhibited no or minimal hydrolysis activity against 8-oxo-dGTP, 8-oxo-GTP, dGTP, GTP, dGDP and GDP. Probably removes oxidized guanine nucleotides from both the DNA and RNA precursor pools.
