UniprotID	Q9NVC3
Accession	Q9NVC3;Q53GJ9;Q9H9I5
EntryName	S38A7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 7 (Solute carrier family 38 member 7)
GeneName	SLC38A7 SNAT7
Length	462
Function	Symporter that selectively cotransports sodium ions and amino acids, such as L-glutamine and L-asparagine from the lysosome into the cytoplasm and may participates in mTORC1 activation (PubMed:28416685, PubMed:35561222). The transport activity requires an acidic lysosomal lumen (PubMed:28416685).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane; Cell projection; Axon
