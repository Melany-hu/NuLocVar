EntryName	LAMP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP-1) (Lysosome-associated membrane protein 1) (CD107 antigen-like family member A) (CD antigen CD107a)
GeneName	LAMP1
Length	417
Function	Lysosomal membrane glycoprotein which plays an important role in lysosome biogenesis, lysosomal pH regulation, autophagy and cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:37390818). Acts as an important regulator of lysosomal lumen pH regulation by acting as a direct inhibitor of the proton channel TMEM175, facilitating lysosomal acidification for optimal hydrolase activity (PubMed:37390818). Also plays an important role in NK-cells cytotoxicity (PubMed:2022921, PubMed:23632890). Mechanistically, participates in cytotoxic granule movement to the cell surface and perforin trafficking to the lytic granule (PubMed:23632890). In addition, protects NK-cells from degranulation-associated damage induced by their own cytotoxic granule content (PubMed:23847195). Presents carbohydrate ligands to selectins (PubMed:7685349).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane; Endosome membrane; Late endosome membrane; Cell membrane; Cytolytic granule membrane
