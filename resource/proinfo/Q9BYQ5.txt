UniprotID	Q9BYQ5
Accession	Q9BYQ5;Q9BYR1
EntryName	KRA46_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 4-6 (Keratin-associated protein 4-15) (Keratin-associated protein 4.15) (Keratin-associated protein 4.6) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 4.15)
GeneName	KRTAP4-6 KAP4.15 KRTAP4-15 KRTAP4.15 KRTAP4.6
Length	205
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
