UniprotID	Q9NWB7
Accession	Q9NWB7;Q96DA9
EntryName	IFT57_HUMAN
ProteinName	Intraflagellar transport protein 57 homolog (Dermal papilla-derived protein 8) (Estrogen-related receptor beta-like protein 1) (HIP1-interacting protein) (MHS4R2)
GeneName	IFT57 DERP8 ESRRBL1 HIPPI
Length	429
Function	Required for the formation of cilia. Plays an indirect role in sonic hedgehog signaling, cilia being required for all activity of the hedgehog pathway (By similarity). Has pro-apoptotic function via its interaction with HIP1, leading to recruit caspase-8 (CASP8) and trigger apoptosis. Has the ability to bind DNA sequence motif 5'-AAAGACATG-3' present in the promoter of caspase genes such as CASP1, CASP8 and CASP10, suggesting that it may act as a transcription regulator; however the relevance of such function remains unclear.
Subcellular Location	Cell projection; Cilium; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium basal body
