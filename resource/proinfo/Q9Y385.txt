EntryName	UB2J1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J1 (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme J1) (Non-canonical ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 1) (NCUBE-1) (Yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC6 homolog E) (HsUBC6e)
GeneName	UBE2J1 NCUBE1 CGI-76 HSPC153 HSPC205
Length	318
Function	Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. Functions in the selective degradation of misfolded membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ERAD) and is essential for cells to recover from ER stress (PubMed:28321712). Plays a role in MAPKAPK2-dependent translational control of TNF-alpha synthesis (PubMed:24020373). Also acts as a platform for perinuclear positioning of the endosomal system by mediating ubiquitination of SQSTM1 through interaction with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF26 (PubMed:33472082). Plays a role in male fecundity through the interaction with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF133 (PubMed:35831855).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
