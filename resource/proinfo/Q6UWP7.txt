Accession	Q6UWP7;A6H8Z7;Q8N1Q7
EntryName	LCLT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1 (EC 2.3.1.-) (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 8) (1-AGP acyltransferase 8) (1-AGPAT 8) (EC 2.3.1.51) (Acyl-CoA:lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1)
GeneName	LCLAT1 AGPAT8 ALCAT1 LYCAT UNQ1849/PRO3579
Length	414
Function	Exhibits acyl-CoA:lysocardiolipin acyltransferase (ALCAT) activity; catalyzes the reacylation of lyso-cardiolipin to cardiolipin (CL), a key step in CL remodeling (By similarity). Recognizes both monolysocardiolipin and dilysocardiolipin as substrates with a preference for linoleoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA as acyl donors (By similarity). Also exhibits 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity (AGPAT) activity; converts 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3- phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid or LPA) into 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-3- phosphate (phosphatidic acid or PA) by incorporating an acyl moiety at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone (PubMed:16620771). Possesses both lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase (LPIAT) and lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase (LPGAT) activities (PubMed:19075029). Required for establishment of the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages (By similarity).
