EntryName	GBRA5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-5 (GABA(A) receptor subunit alpha-5) (GABAAR subunit alpha-5)
GeneName	GABRA5
Length	462
Function	Alpha subunit of the heteropentameric ligand-gated chloride channel gated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain (PubMed:14993607, PubMed:29961870, PubMed:30140029, PubMed:31056671). GABA-gated chloride channels, also named GABA(A) receptors (GABAAR), consist of five subunits arranged around a central pore and contain GABA active binding site(s) located at the alpha and beta subunit interface(s) (PubMed:30140029). When activated by GABA, GABAARs selectively allow the flow of chloride anions across the cell membrane down their electrochemical gradient (PubMed:14993607, PubMed:30140029). GABAARs containing alpha-5/GABRA5 subunits are mainly extrasynaptic and contribute to the tonic GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampus (By similarity). Extrasynaptic alpha-5-containing GABAARs in CA1 pyramidal neurons play a role in learning and memory processes (By similarity).
