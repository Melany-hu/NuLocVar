ProteinName	Numb-like protein (Numb-related protein) (Numb-R)
GeneName	NUMBL
Length	609
Function	Plays a role in the process of neurogenesis. Required throughout embryonic neurogenesis to maintain neural progenitor cells, also called radial glial cells (RGCs), by allowing their daughter cells to choose progenitor over neuronal cell fate. Not required for the proliferation of neural progenitor cells before the onset of embryonic neurogenesis. Also required postnatally in the subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis by regulating SVZ neuroblasts survival and ependymal wall integrity. Negative regulator of NF-kappa-B signaling pathway. The inhibition of NF-kappa-B activation is mediated at least in part, by preventing MAP3K7IP2 to interact with polyubiquitin chains of TRAF6 and RIPK1 and by stimulating the 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of TRAF6 in cortical neurons.
