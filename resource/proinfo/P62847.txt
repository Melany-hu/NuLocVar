Accession	P62847;E7EPK6;P16632;Q5T0P7;Q5T0P8;Q7Z3D1
EntryName	RS24_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein eS24 (40S ribosomal protein S24)
GeneName	RPS24
Length	133
Function	Component of the small ribosomal subunit (PubMed:23636399). The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:23636399). Required for processing of pre-rRNA and maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits (PubMed:18230666). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
