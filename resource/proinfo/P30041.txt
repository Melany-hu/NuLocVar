GeneName	PRDX6 AOP2 KIAA0106
Length	224
Function	Thiol-specific peroxidase that catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water and alcohols, respectively (PubMed:10893423, PubMed:9497358). Can reduce H(2)O(2) and short chain organic, fatty acid, and phospholipid hydroperoxides (PubMed:10893423). Also has phospholipase activity, can therefore either reduce the oxidized sn-2 fatty acyl group of phospholipids (peroxidase activity) or hydrolyze the sn-2 ester bond of phospholipids (phospholipase activity) (PubMed:10893423, PubMed:26830860). These activities are dependent on binding to phospholipids at acidic pH and to oxidized phospholipds at cytosolic pH (PubMed:10893423). Plays a role in cell protection against oxidative stress by detoxifying peroxides and in phospholipid homeostasis (PubMed:10893423). Exhibits acyl-CoA-dependent lysophospholipid acyltransferase which mediates the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or LPC) into phosphatidylcholine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or PC) (PubMed:26830860). Shows a clear preference for LPC as the lysophospholipid and for palmitoyl CoA as the fatty acyl substrate (PubMed:26830860).
