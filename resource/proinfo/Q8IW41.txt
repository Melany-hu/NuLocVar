UniprotID	Q8IW41
Accession	Q8IW41;B3KVA5;O60491;Q86X46;Q9BVX9;Q9UG86
EntryName	MAPK5_HUMAN
ProteinName	MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 5 (MAPK-activated protein kinase 5) (MAPKAP kinase 5) (MAPKAP-K5) (MAPKAPK-5) (MK-5) (MK5) (EC 2.7.11.1) (p38-regulated/activated protein kinase) (PRAK)
GeneName	MAPKAPK5 PRAK
Length	473
Function	Tumor suppressor serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in mTORC1 signaling and post-transcriptional regulation. Phosphorylates FOXO3, ERK3/MAPK6, ERK4/MAPK4, HSP27/HSPB1, p53/TP53 and RHEB. Acts as a tumor suppressor by mediating Ras-induced senescence and phosphorylating p53/TP53. Involved in post-transcriptional regulation of MYC by mediating phosphorylation of FOXO3: phosphorylation of FOXO3 leads to promote nuclear localization of FOXO3, enabling expression of miR-34b and miR-34c, 2 post-transcriptional regulators of MYC that bind to the 3'UTR of MYC transcript and prevent MYC translation. Acts as a negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling by mediating phosphorylation and inhibition of RHEB. Part of the atypical MAPK signaling via its interaction with ERK3/MAPK6 or ERK4/MAPK4: the precise role of the complex formed with ERK3/MAPK6 or ERK4/MAPK4 is still unclear, but the complex follows a complex set of phosphorylation events: upon interaction with atypical MAPK (ERK3/MAPK6 or ERK4/MAPK4), ERK3/MAPK6 (or ERK4/MAPK4) is phosphorylated and then mediates phosphorylation and activation of MAPKAPK5, which in turn phosphorylates ERK3/MAPK6 (or ERK4/MAPK4). Mediates phosphorylation of HSP27/HSPB1 in response to PKA/PRKACA stimulation, inducing F-actin rearrangement.
