EntryName	AKCL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	1,5-anhydro-D-fructose reductase (AF reductase) (EC 1.1.1.263) (Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C-like protein 2) (Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member E2) (LoopADR) (Testis aldo-keto reductase) (htAKR) (Testis-specific protein) (hTSP)
GeneName	AKR1E2 AKR1CL2 AKRDC1
Length	320
Function	Catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (AF) to 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol (By similarity). Has low NADPH-dependent reductase activity towards 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (in vitro) (PubMed:12604216, PubMed:15118078).
