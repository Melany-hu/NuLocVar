EntryName	TLR4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Toll-like receptor 4 (hToll) (CD antigen CD284)
GeneName	TLR4
Length	839
Function	Transmembrane receptor that functions as a pattern recognition receptor recognizing pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) to induce innate immune responses via downstream signaling pathways (PubMed:10835634, PubMed:15809303, PubMed:16622205, PubMed:17292937, PubMed:17478729, PubMed:20037584, PubMed:20711192, PubMed:23880187, PubMed:27022195, PubMed:29038465, PubMed:17803912). At the plasma membrane, cooperates with LY96 to mediate the innate immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (PubMed:27022195). Also involved in LPS-independent inflammatory responses triggered by free fatty acids, such as palmitate, and Ni(2+) (PubMed:20711192). Mechanistically, acts via MYD88, TIRAP and TRAF6, leading to NF-kappa-B activation, cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response (PubMed:10835634, PubMed:21393102, PubMed:27022195, PubMed:36945827, PubMed:9237759). Alternatively, CD14-mediated TLR4 internalization via endocytosis is associated with the initiation of a MYD88-independent signaling via the TICAM1-TBK1-IRF3 axis leading to type I interferon production (PubMed:14517278). In addition to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, initiates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and formation of a positive feedback loop between autophagy and NF-kappa-B signaling cascade (PubMed:32894580). In complex with TLR6, promotes inflammation in monocytes/macrophages by associating with TLR6 and the receptor CD86 (PubMed:23880187). Upon ligand binding, such as oxLDL or amyloid-beta 42, the TLR4:TLR6 complex is internalized and triggers inflammatory response, leading to NF-kappa-B-dependent production of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL9 cytokines, via MYD88 signaling pathway, and CCL5 cytokine, via TICAM1 signaling pathway (PubMed:23880187). In myeloid dendritic cells, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G but not LPS promotes the activation of IRF7, leading to type I IFN production in a CD14-dependent manner (PubMed:15265881, PubMed:23880187). Required for the migration-promoting effects of ZG16B/PAUF on pancreatic cancer cells.
