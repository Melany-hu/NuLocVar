UniprotID	P21926
Accession	P21926;D3DUQ9;Q5J7W6;Q96ES4
EntryName	CD9_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD9 antigen (5H9 antigen) (Cell growth-inhibiting gene 2 protein) (Leukocyte antigen MIC3) (Motility-related protein) (MRP-1) (Tetraspanin-29) (Tspan-29) (p24) (CD antigen CD9)
GeneName	CD9 MIC3 TSPAN29 GIG2
Length	228
Function	Integral membrane protein associated with integrins, which regulates different processes, such as sperm-egg fusion, platelet activation and aggregation, and cell adhesion (PubMed:14575715, PubMed:18541721, PubMed:8478605). Present at the cell surface of oocytes and plays a key role in sperm-egg fusion, possibly by organizing multiprotein complexes and the morphology of the membrane required for the fusion (By similarity). In myoblasts, associates with CD81 and PTGFRN and inhibits myotube fusion during muscle regeneration (By similarity). In macrophages, associates with CD81 and beta-1 and beta-2 integrins, and prevents macrophage fusion into multinucleated giant cells specialized in ingesting complement-opsonized large particles (PubMed:12796480). Also prevents the fusion between mononuclear cell progenitors into osteoclasts in charge of bone resorption (By similarity). Acts as a receptor for PSG17 (By similarity). Involved in platelet activation and aggregation (PubMed:18541721). Regulates paranodal junction formation (By similarity). Involved in cell adhesion, cell motility and tumor metastasis (PubMed:7511626, PubMed:8478605).
