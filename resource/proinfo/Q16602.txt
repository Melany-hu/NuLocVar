UniprotID	Q16602
Accession	Q16602;A8K6G5;A8KAD3;Q53S02;Q53TS5
EntryName	CALRL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcitonin gene-related peptide type 1 receptor (CGRP type 1 receptor) (Calcitonin receptor-like receptor) (CRLR)
GeneName	CALCRL CGRPR
Length	461
Function	G protein-coupled receptor which specificity is determined by its interaction with receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) (PubMed:32296767, PubMed:33602864, PubMed:8626685). Together with RAMP1, form the receptor complex for calcitonin-gene-related peptides CALCA/CGRP1 and CALCB/CGRP2 (PubMed:33602864). Together with RAMP2 or RAMP3, function as receptor complexes for adrenomedullin (ADM and ADM2) (PubMed:32296767, PubMed:9620797). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors. Activates cAMP-dependent pathway (PubMed:32296767, PubMed:8626685).
