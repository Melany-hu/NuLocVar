UniprotID	P42785
Accession	P42785;A8MU24;B2R7B7;B3KRK5;B5BU34
EntryName	PCP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase (EC 3.4.16.2) (Angiotensinase C) (Lysosomal carboxypeptidase C) (Proline carboxypeptidase) (Prolylcarboxypeptidase) (PRCP)
GeneName	PRCP PCP
Length	496
Function	Cleaves C-terminal amino acids linked to proline in peptides such as angiotensin II, III and des-Arg9-bradykinin. This cleavage occurs at acidic pH, but enzymatic activity is retained with some substrates at neutral pH.
Subcellular Location	Lysosome
