ProteinName	Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2
GeneName	CHRM2
Length	466
Function	The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mediates various cellular responses, including inhibition of adenylate cyclase, breakdown of phosphoinositides and modulation of potassium channels through the action of G proteins. Primary transducing effect is adenylate cyclase inhibition. Signaling promotes phospholipase C activity, leading to the release of inositol trisphosphate (IP3); this then triggers calcium ion release into the cytosol.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Postsynaptic cell membrane
