EntryName	ZDHC9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC9 (EC 2.3.1.225) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 9) (DHHC-9) (DHHC9) (Zinc finger protein 379) (Zinc finger protein 380)
GeneName	ZDHHC9 CXorf11 ZDHHC10 ZNF379 ZNF380 CGI-89 UNQ261/PRO298
Length	364
Function	Palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of palmitate onto various protein substrates, such as ADRB2, GSDMD, HRAS, NRAS and CGAS (PubMed:16000296, PubMed:27481942, PubMed:37802025, PubMed:38530158, PubMed:38599239). The ZDHHC9-GOLGA7 complex is a palmitoyltransferase specific for HRAS and NRAS (PubMed:16000296). May have a palmitoyltransferase activity toward the beta-2 adrenergic receptor/ADRB2 and therefore regulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling (PubMed:27481942). Acts as a regulator of innate immunity by catalyzing palmitoylation of CGAS, thereby promoting CGAS homodimerization and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase activity (PubMed:37802025). Activates pyroptosis by catalyzing palmitoylation of gasdermin-D (GSDMD), thereby promoting membrane translocation and pore formation of GSDMD (PubMed:38530158, PubMed:38599239).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane
