EntryName	TFB2M_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dimethyladenosine transferase 2, mitochondrial (EC 2.1.1.-) (Hepatitis C virus NS5A-transactivated protein 5) (HCV NS5A-transactivated protein 5) (Mitochondrial 12S rRNA dimethylase 2) (Mitochondrial transcription factor B2) (h-mtTFB) (h-mtTFB2) (hTFB2M) (mtTFB2) (S-adenosylmethionine-6-N', N'-adenosyl(rRNA) dimethyltransferase 2)
GeneName	TFB2M NS5ATP5
Length	396
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent rRNA methyltransferase which may methylate two specific adjacent adenosines in the loop of a conserved hairpin near the 3'-end of 12S mitochondrial rRNA (Probable). Component of the mitochondrial transcription initiation complex, composed at least of TFB2M, TFAM and POLRMT that is required for basal transcription of mitochondrial DNA (PubMed:12068295, PubMed:15526033, PubMed:20410300, PubMed:29149603). In this complex, TFAM recruits POLRMT to a specific promoter whereas TFB2M induces structural changes in POLRMT to enable promoter opening and trapping of the DNA non-template strand (PubMed:15526033, PubMed:29149603). Stimulates transcription independently of the methyltransferase activity (PubMed:12897151).
