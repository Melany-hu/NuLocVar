Accession	P55145;Q14CX4;Q86U67;Q96IS4
EntryName	MANF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (Arginine-rich protein) (Protein ARMET)
GeneName	MANF ARMET ARP
Length	182
Function	Selectively promotes the survival of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral mid-brain (PubMed:12794311). Modulates GABAergic transmission to the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (By similarity). Enhances spontaneous, as well as evoked, GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents in dopaminergic neurons (By similarity). Inhibits cell proliferation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cell death (PubMed:18561914, PubMed:22637475, PubMed:29497057). Retained in the ER/sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through association with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein HSPA5 under normal conditions (PubMed:22637475). Up-regulated and secreted by the ER/SR in response to ER stress and hypoxia (PubMed:22637475). Following secretion by the ER/SR, directly binds to 3-O-sulfogalactosylceramide, a lipid sulfatide in the outer cell membrane of target cells (PubMed:29497057). Sulfatide binding promotes its cellular uptake by endocytosis, and is required for its role in alleviating ER stress and cell toxicity under hypoxic and ER stress conditions (PubMed:29497057).
