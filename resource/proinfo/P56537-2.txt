UniprotID	P56537-2
Accession	P56537;B7ZBG9;Q6IBN8;Q96TD5
EntryName	IF6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF-6) (B(2)GCN homolog) (B4 integrin interactor) (CAB) (p27(BBP))
GeneName	EIF6 EIF3A ITGB4BP OK/SW-cl.27
Length	226
Function	Binds to the 60S ribosomal subunit and prevents its association with the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S initiation complex in the cytoplasm (PubMed:10085284, PubMed:14654845, PubMed:21536732, PubMed:32669547). Behaves as a stimulatory translation initiation factor downstream insulin/growth factors. Is also involved in ribosome biogenesis. Associates with pre-60S subunits in the nucleus and is involved in its nuclear export. Cytoplasmic release of TIF6 from 60S subunits and nuclear relocalization is promoted by a RACK1 (RACK1)-dependent protein kinase C activity (PubMed:10085284, PubMed:14654845, PubMed:21536732). In tissues responsive to insulin, controls fatty acid synthesis and glycolysis by exerting translational control of adipogenic transcription factors such as CEBPB, CEBPD and ATF4 that have G/C rich or uORF in their 5'UTR. Required for ROS-dependent megakaryocyte maturation and platelets formation, controls the expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain genes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis (By similarity). Involved in miRNA-mediated gene silencing by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Required for both miRNA-mediated translational repression and miRNA-mediated cleavage of complementary mRNAs by RISC (PubMed:17507929). Modulates cell cycle progression and global translation of pre-B cells, its activation seems to be rate-limiting in tumorigenesis and tumor growth (By similarity).
