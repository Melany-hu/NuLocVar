UniprotID	Q5SW96
Accession	Q5SW96;A2BHI5;Q6TQS9;Q8N2Y0;Q9UFI9
EntryName	ARH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Low density lipoprotein receptor adapter protein 1 (Autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia protein)
GeneName	LDLRAP1 ARH
Length	308
Function	Adapter protein (clathrin-associated sorting protein (CLASP)) required for efficient endocytosis of the LDL receptor (LDLR) in polarized cells such as hepatocytes and lymphocytes, but not in non-polarized cells (fibroblasts). May be required for LDL binding and internalization but not for receptor clustering in coated pits. May facilitate the endocytosis of LDLR and LDLR-LDL complexes from coated pits by stabilizing the interaction between the receptor and the structural components of the pits. May also be involved in the internalization of other LDLR family members. Binds to phosphoinositides, which regulate clathrin bud assembly at the cell surface. Required for trafficking of LRP2 to the endocytic recycling compartment which is necessary for LRP2 proteolysis, releasing a tail fragment which translocates to the nucleus and mediates transcriptional repression (By similarity).
