EntryName	CHST6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 6 (Corneal N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase) (C-GlcNAc6ST) (hCGn6ST) (EC 2.8.2.21) (Galactose/N-acetylglucosamine/N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase 4-beta) (GST4-beta) (N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase 5) (GlcNAc6ST-5) (Gn6st-5)
GeneName	CHST6
Length	395
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) as sulfonate donor to catalyze the transfer of sulfate to position 6 of non-reducing N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues of keratan (PubMed:11278593, PubMed:11352640, PubMed:12218059, PubMed:17690104). Cooperates with B4GALT4 galactosyltransferase and B3GNT7 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase to construct and elongate the sulfated disaccharide unit  within keratan sulfate polymer. Involved in biosynthesis of keratan sulfate in cornea, with an impact on proteoglycan fibril organization and corneal transparency (PubMed:11278593, PubMed:12218059, PubMed:17690104). Involved in sulfation of endothelial mucins such as GLYCAM1 (PubMed:11352640).
