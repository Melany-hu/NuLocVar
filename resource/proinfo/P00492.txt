UniprotID	P00492
Accession	P00492;A6NHF0;B2R8M9
EntryName	HPRT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) (HGPRTase) (EC 2.4.2.8)
GeneName	HPRT1 HPRT
Length	218
Function	Converts guanine to guanosine monophosphate, and hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate. Transfers the 5-phosphoribosyl group from 5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate onto the purine. Plays a central role in the generation of purine nucleotides through the purine salvage pathway.
