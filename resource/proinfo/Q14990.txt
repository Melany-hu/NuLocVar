UniprotID	Q14990
Accession	Q14990;Q3SX72
EntryName	ODFP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Outer dense fiber protein 1 (Heat shock protein beta-10) (HspB10) (Heat shock protein family B member 10)
GeneName	ODF1 HSPB10 ODFP
Length	250
Function	Component of the outer dense fibers (ODF) of spermatozoa. ODF are filamentous structures located on the outside of the axoneme in the midpiece and principal piece of the mammalian sperm tail and may help to maintain the passive elastic structures and elastic recoil of the sperm tail.
