UniprotID	P62745
Accession	P62745;B2R692;P01121;Q5U0H6;Q7RTN5;Q7RTR9;Q9CUV7
EntryName	RHOB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoB (Rho cDNA clone 6) (h6)
GeneName	RHOB ARH6 ARHB
Length	196
Function	Mediates apoptosis in neoplastically transformed cells after DNA damage. Not essential for development but affects cell adhesion and growth factor signaling in transformed cells. Plays a negative role in tumorigenesis as deletion causes tumor formation. Involved in intracellular protein trafficking of a number of proteins. Targets PKN1 to endosomes and is involved in trafficking of the EGF receptor from late endosomes to lysosomes. Also required for stability and nuclear trafficking of AKT1/AKT which promotes endothelial cell survival during vascular development. Serves as a microtubule-dependent signal that is required for the myosin contractile ring formation during cell cycle cytokinesis. Required for genotoxic stress-induced cell death in breast cancer cells.
Subcellular Location	Late endosome membrane; Cell membrane; Nucleus; Cleavage furrow
