EntryName	FDFT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Squalene synthase (SQS) (SS) (EC 2.5.1.21) (FPP:FPP farnesyltransferase) (Farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase) (Farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1)
GeneName	FDFT1
Length	417
Function	Catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) moieties to form squalene. Proceeds in two distinct steps. In the first half-reaction, two molecules of FPP react to form the stable presqualene diphosphate intermediate (PSQPP), with concomitant release of a proton and a molecule of inorganic diphosphate. In the second half-reaction, PSQPP undergoes heterolysis, isomerization, and reduction with NADPH or NADH to form squalene. It is the first committed enzyme of the sterol biosynthesis pathway.
