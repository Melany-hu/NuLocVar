UniprotID	O43603
Accession	O43603;A5JUU4;Q32MN8
EntryName	GALR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Galanin receptor type 2 (GAL2-R) (GALR-2)
GeneName	GALR2 GALNR2
Length	387
Function	Receptor for the hormone galanin and GALP. Receptor for the hormone spexin-1 (PubMed:24517231). The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins that activate the phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway (via G(q)) and that inhibit adenylyl cyclase (via G(i)).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
