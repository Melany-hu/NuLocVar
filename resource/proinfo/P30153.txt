UniprotID	P30153
Accession	P30153;Q13773;Q6ICQ3;Q96DH3
EntryName	2AAA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A 65 kDa regulatory subunit A alpha isoform (PP2Aa) (Medium tumor antigen-associated 61 kDa protein) (PP2A subunit A isoform PR65-alpha) (PP2A subunit A isoform R1-alpha)
GeneName	PPP2R1A
Length	589
Function	The PR65 subunit of protein phosphatase 2A serves as a scaffolding molecule to coordinate the assembly of the catalytic subunit and a variable regulatory B subunit (PubMed:15525651, PubMed:16580887, PubMed:33243860, PubMed:33633399, PubMed:34004147, PubMed:8694763). Upon interaction with GNA12 promotes dephosphorylation of microtubule associated protein TAU/MAPT (PubMed:15525651). Required for proper chromosome segregation and for centromeric localization of SGO1 in mitosis (PubMed:16580887). Together with RACK1 adapter, mediates dephosphorylation of AKT1 at 'Ser-473', preventing AKT1 activation and AKT-mTOR signaling pathway (By similarity). Dephosphorylation of AKT1 is essential for regulatory T-cells (Treg) homeostasis and stability (By similarity). Part of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes (PubMed:18782753, PubMed:33633399). STRIPAK complexes have critical roles in protein (de)phosphorylation and are regulators of multiple signaling pathways including Hippo, MAPK, nuclear receptor and cytoskeleton remodeling (PubMed:18782753, PubMed:33633399). Different types of STRIPAK complexes are involved in a variety of biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism and immune regulation (PubMed:18782753, PubMed:33633399). Key mediator of a quality checkpoint during transcription elongation as part of the Integrator-PP2A (INTAC) complex (PubMed:33243860, PubMed:34004147). The INTAC complex drives premature transcription termination of transcripts that are unfavorably configured for transcriptional elongation: within the INTAC complex, acts as a scaffolding subunit for PPP2CA, which catalyzes dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II subunit POLR2A/RPB1 and SUPT5H/SPT5, thereby preventing transcriptional elongation (PubMed:33243860, PubMed:34004147). Regulates the recruitment of the SKA complex to kinetochores (PubMed:28982702).
