UniprotID	Q9H4E5
Accession	Q9H4E5;Q96KC1
EntryName	RHOJ_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoJ (Ras-like protein family member 7B) (Tc10-like GTP-binding protein)
GeneName	RHOJ ARHJ RASL7B RHOI TCL
Length	214
Function	Plasma membrane-associated small GTPase specifically involved in angiogenesis (PubMed:21628409, PubMed:24434213, PubMed:30158707). Required for endothelial cell migration during vascular development via its interaction with GLUL (PubMed:30158707). Elicits the formation of F-actin-rich structures, thereby regulating endothelial cell migration (PubMed:30158707).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
