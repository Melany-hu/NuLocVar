EntryName	PLPP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholipid phosphatase 2 (EC 3.1.3.-) (EC 3.1.3.4) (Lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase 2) (PAP2-gamma) (PAP2-G) (Phosphatidate phosphohydrolase type 2c) (Phosphatidic acid phosphatase 2c) (PAP-2c) (PAP2c)
GeneName	PLPP2 LPP2 PPAP2C
Length	288
Function	Magnesium-independent phospholipid phosphatase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of a variety of glycerolipid and sphingolipid phosphate esters including phosphatidate/PA, lysophosphatidate/LPA, sphingosine 1-phosphate/S1P and ceramide 1-phosphate/C1P (PubMed:16467304, PubMed:9607309, PubMed:9705349). Has no apparent extracellular phosphatase activity and therefore most probably acts intracellularly (PubMed:16467304). Also acts on N-oleoyl ethanolamine phosphate/N-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-ethanolamine phosphate, a potential physiological compound (PubMed:9607309). Through dephosphorylation of these bioactive lipid mediators produces new bioactive compounds and may regulate signal transduction in different cellular processes (Probable). Indirectly regulates, for instance, cell cycle G1/S phase transition through its phospholipid phosphatase activity (By similarity).
