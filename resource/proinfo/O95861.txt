UniprotID	O95861
Accession	O95861;A8K7C8;B4DPS5;B4DUS9;D3DTA9;Q8WVL5;Q9UGJ3
EntryName	BPNT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	3'(2'),5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase 1 (EC 3.1.3.7) (3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate phosphatase) (PAP phosphatase) (Bisphosphate 3'-nucleotidase 1) (BPntase 1) (HsPIP) (Inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase) (EC 3.1.3.57)
GeneName	BPNT1
Length	308
Function	Phosphatase that converts 3'(2')-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) to AMP and inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (Ins(1,4)P2) to inositol 4-phosphate (PubMed:10675562). Is also able to hydrolyze adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) (By similarity). Probably prevents the toxic accumulation of PAP, a compound which inhibits a variety of proteins, including PAPS-utilizing enzymes such as sulfotransferases, and RNA processing enzymes. Could also play a role in inositol recycling and phosphoinositide metabolism. Is not active on 3'-AMP, inositol-1-phosphate and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (PubMed:10675562).
