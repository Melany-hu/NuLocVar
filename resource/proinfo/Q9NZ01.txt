EntryName	TECR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Very-long-chain enoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.93) (Synaptic glycoprotein SC2) (Trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase) (TER)
GeneName	TECR GPSN2 SC2
Length	308
Function	Involved in both the production of very long-chain fatty acids for sphingolipid synthesis and the degradation of the sphingosine moiety in sphingolipids through the sphingosine 1-phosphate metabolic pathway (PubMed:25049234). Catalyzes the last of the four reactions of the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle (PubMed:12482854). This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process, allows the addition of 2 carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids/VLCFAs per cycle (PubMed:12482854). This enzyme reduces the trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA fatty acid intermediate to an acyl-CoA that can be further elongated by entering a new cycle of elongation (PubMed:12482854). Thereby, it participates in the production of VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators (PubMed:12482854). Catalyzes the saturation step of the sphingosine 1-phosphate metabolic pathway, the conversion of trans-2-hexadecenoyl-CoA to palmitoyl-CoA (PubMed:25049234).
