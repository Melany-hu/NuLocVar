EntryName	CNBP_HUMAN
ProteinName	CCHC-type zinc finger nucleic acid binding protein (Cellular nucleic acid-binding protein) (CNBP) (Zinc finger protein 9)
GeneName	CNBP RNF163 ZNF9
Length	177
Function	Single-stranded DNA-binding protein that preferentially binds to the sterol regulatory element (SRE) sequence 5'-GTGCGGTG-3', and thereby mediates transcriptional repression (PubMed:2562787). Has a role as transactivator of the Myc promoter (By similarity). Binds single-stranded RNA in a sequence-specific manner (By similarity).
