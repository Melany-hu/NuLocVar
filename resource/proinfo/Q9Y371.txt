EntryName	SHLB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endophilin-B1 (Bax-interacting factor 1) (Bif-1) (SH3 domain-containing GRB2-like protein B1)
GeneName	SH3GLB1 KIAA0491 CGI-61
Length	365
Function	May be required for normal outer mitochondrial membrane dynamics (PubMed:15452144). Required for coatomer-mediated retrograde transport in certain cells (By similarity). May recruit other proteins to membranes with high curvature. May promote membrane fusion (PubMed:11604418). Involved in activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis by promoting BAX/BAK1 activation (PubMed:16227588). Isoform 1 acts proapoptotic in fibroblasts (By similarity). Involved in caspase-independent apoptosis during nutrition starvation and involved in the regulation of autophagy. Activates lipid kinase activity of PIK3C3 during autophagy probably by associating with the PI3K complex II (PI3KC3-C2) (PubMed:17891140). Associated with PI3KC3-C2 during autophagy may regulate the trafficking of ATG9A from the Golgi complex to the peripheral cytoplasm for the formation of autophagosomes by inducing Golgi membrane tubulation and fragmentation (PubMed:21068542). Involved in regulation of degradative endocytic trafficking and cytokinesis, probably in the context of PI3KC3-C2 (PubMed:20643123). Isoform 2 acts antiapoptotic in neuronal cells; involved in maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and promotes neuronal viability (By similarity).
