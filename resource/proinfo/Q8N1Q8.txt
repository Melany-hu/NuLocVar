EntryName	THEM5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase THEM5 (Acyl-CoA thioesterase THEM5) (EC 3.1.2.2) (Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 15) (Thioesterase superfamily member 5)
GeneName	THEM5 ACOT15
Length	247
Function	Has acyl-CoA thioesterase activity towards long-chain (C16 and C18) fatty acyl-CoA substrates, with a preference for linoleoyl-CoA and other unsaturated long-chain fatty acid-CoA esters (PubMed:22586271). Plays an important role in mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism, and in remodeling of the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin (PubMed:22586271). Required for normal mitochondrial function (PubMed:22586271).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
