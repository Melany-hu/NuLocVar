UniprotID	Q8TDS5
Accession	Q8TDS5;Q86WP7;Q8NGW4
EntryName	OXER1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Oxoeicosanoid receptor 1 (5-oxo-ETE G-protein coupled receptor) (G-protein coupled receptor 170) (G-protein coupled receptor R527) (G-protein coupled receptor TG1019)
GeneName	OXER1 GPR170 TG1019
Length	384
Function	Receptor for eicosanoids and polyunsaturated fatty acids such as 5-oxo-6E,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-OXO-ETE), 5(S)-hydroperoxy-6E,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (5(S)-HPETE) and arachidonic acid. Seems to be coupled to the G(i)/G(o), families of heteromeric G proteins.
