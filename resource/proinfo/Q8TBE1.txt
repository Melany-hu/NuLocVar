UniprotID	Q8TBE1
Accession	Q8TBE1
EntryName	CNIH3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein cornichon homolog 3 (CNIH-3) (Cornichon family AMPA receptor auxiliary protein 3)
GeneName	CNIH3
Length	160
Function	Regulates the trafficking and gating properties of AMPA-selective glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Promotes their targeting to the cell membrane and synapses and modulates their gating properties by regulating their rates of activation, deactivation and desensitization.
Subcellular Location	Postsynaptic cell membrane
