EntryName	MPPE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Metallophosphoesterase 1 (EC 3.1.-.-) (Post-GPI attachment to proteins factor 5)
GeneName	MPPE1 PGAP5 PP579
Length	396
Function	Metallophosphoesterase required for transport of GPI-anchor proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. Acts in lipid remodeling steps of GPI-anchor maturation by mediating the removal of a side-chain ethanolamine-phosphate (EtNP) from the second Man (Man2) of the GPI intermediate, an essential step for efficient transport of GPI-anchor proteins.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane; Golgi apparatus; cis-Golgi network membrane
