UniprotID	Q9NQQ7
Accession	Q9NQQ7;B7Z6V6;E1P5T0;Q53GK3;Q5JW05;Q96CJ8;Q9Y304
EntryName	S35C2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 35 member C2 (Ovarian cancer-overexpressed gene 1 protein)
GeneName	SLC35C2 C20orf5 OVCOV1 CGI-15
Length	365
Function	May play an important role in the cellular response to tissue hypoxia. May be either a GDP-fucose transporter that competes with SLC35C1 for GDP-fucose, or a factor that otherwise enhances the fucosylation of Notch and is required for optimal Notch signaling in mammalian cells.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; cis-Golgi network membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane
