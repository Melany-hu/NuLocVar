UniprotID	P40259
Accession	P40259;Q53FS2;Q9BU06
EntryName	CD79B_HUMAN
ProteinName	B-cell antigen receptor complex-associated protein beta chain (B-cell-specific glycoprotein B29) (Ig-beta) (Immunoglobulin-associated B29 protein) (CD antigen CD79b)
GeneName	CD79B B29 IGB
Length	229
Function	Required in cooperation with CD79A for initiation of the signal transduction cascade activated by the B-cell antigen receptor complex (BCR) which leads to internalization of the complex, trafficking to late endosomes and antigen presentation. Enhances phosphorylation of CD79A, possibly by recruiting kinases which phosphorylate CD79A or by recruiting proteins which bind to CD79A and protect it from dephosphorylation.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
