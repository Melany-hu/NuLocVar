UniprotID	O60235
Accession	O60235;Q08AF6
EntryName	TM11D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protease serine 11D (EC 3.4.21.-) (Airway trypsin-like protease) [Cleaved into: Transmembrane protease serine 11D non-catalytic chain; Transmembrane protease serine 11D catalytic chain]
GeneName	TMPRSS11D HAT
Length	418
Function	May play some biological role in the host defense system on the mucous membrane independently of or in cooperation with other substances in airway mucous or bronchial secretions. Plays a role in the proteolytic processing of ACE2. Proteolytically cleaves and activates the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) spike glycoprotein which facilitate virus-cell membrane fusions; spike proteins are synthesized and maintained in precursor intermediate folding states and proteolysis permits the refolding and energy release required to create stable virus-cell linkages and membrane coalescence. Preferentially cleaves the C-terminal side of arginine residues at the P1 position of certain peptides, cleaving Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide most efficiently and having an optimum pH of 8.6 with this substrate.
