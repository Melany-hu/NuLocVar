UniprotID	P09382
Accession	P09382;B2R5E8;Q9UDK5
EntryName	LEG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Galectin-1 (Gal-1) (14 kDa laminin-binding protein) (HLBP14) (14 kDa lectin) (Beta-galactoside-binding lectin L-14-I) (Galaptin) (HBL) (HPL) (Lactose-binding lectin 1) (Lectin galactoside-binding soluble 1) (Putative MAPK-activating protein PM12) (S-Lac lectin 1)
GeneName	LGALS1
Length	135
Function	Lectin that binds beta-galactoside and a wide array of complex carbohydrates. Plays a role in regulating apoptosis, cell proliferation and cell differentiation. Inhibits CD45 protein phosphatase activity and therefore the dephosphorylation of Lyn kinase. Strong inducer of T-cell apoptosis. Plays a negative role in Th17 cell differentiation via activation of the receptor CD69 (PubMed:24752896).
