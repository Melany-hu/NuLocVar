UniprotID	Q8NI37
Accession	Q8NI37;B3KWC5;Q68DZ7;Q6UY82
EntryName	PPTC7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein phosphatase PTC7 homolog (EC 3.1.3.16) (T-cell activation protein phosphatase 2C) (TA-PP2C) (T-cell activation protein phosphatase 2C-like)
GeneName	PPTC7 TAPP2C
Length	304
Function	Protein phosphatase that plays an essential role in mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis (PubMed:30267671). Positively regulates biosynthesis of the ubiquinone, coenzyme Q (PubMed:30267671). Dephosphorylates the ubiquinone biosynthesis protein COQ7 which is likely to lead to its activation (PubMed:30267671). Serves as a crucial sensor for mitophagy, though the underlying mechanism remains ambiguous (By similarity). May dephosphorylate BNIP3 and NIX and thereby directly regulates mitophagy receptor function and stability (By similarity). Alternatively, promotes SCF-FBXL4-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of BNIP3 and NIX independently of its catalytic activity to restrain mitophagy (PubMed:38992176).
