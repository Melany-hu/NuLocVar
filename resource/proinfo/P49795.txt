UniprotID	P49795
Accession	P49795;A8K216;E1P5G9;Q53XN0;Q8TD60
EntryName	RGS19_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 19 (RGS19) (G-alpha-interacting protein) (GAIP)
GeneName	RGS19 GAIP GNAI3IP
Length	217
Function	Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form. Binds to G-alpha subfamily 1 members, with the order G(i)a3 > G(i)a1 > G(o)a >> G(z)a/G(i)a2. Activity on G(z)-alpha is inhibited by phosphorylation and palmitoylation of the G-protein.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
