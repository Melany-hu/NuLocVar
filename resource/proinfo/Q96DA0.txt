UniprotID	Q96DA0
Accession	Q96DA0;A6NIY1;B2R4F6;C3PTT6;Q6UW28
EntryName	PAUF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pancreatic adenocarcinoma up-regulated factor (Zymogen granule protein 16 homolog B)
GeneName	ZG16B PAUF UNQ773/PRO1567
Length	172
Function	Plays an important role in pancreatic tumor progression and metastasis (PubMed:19302292, PubMed:36232715). Promotes pancreatic cancer cells migration and invasion through the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kaapaB signaling pathway, without the involvement of the TLR4/TRIF pathway (PubMed:36232715).
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Cytoplasm; Cell membrane; Apicolateral cell membrane
