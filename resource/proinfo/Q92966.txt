UniprotID	Q92966
Accession	Q92966;D3DRI8;Q2VPI6;Q5T285
EntryName	SNPC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	snRNA-activating protein complex subunit 3 (SNAPc subunit 3) (Proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunit beta) (PSE-binding factor subunit beta) (PTF subunit beta) (Small nuclear RNA-activating complex polypeptide 3) (snRNA-activating protein complex 50 kDa subunit) (SNAPc 50 kDa subunit)
GeneName	SNAPC3 SNAP50
Length	411
Function	Part of the SNAPc complex required for the transcription of both RNA polymerase II and III small-nuclear RNA genes. Binds to the proximal sequence element (PSE), a non-TATA-box basal promoter element common to these 2 types of genes. Recruits TBP and BRF2 to the U6 snRNA TATA box.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
