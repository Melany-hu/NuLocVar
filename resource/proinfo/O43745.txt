UniprotID	O43745
Accession	O43745;A8K2I8
EntryName	CHP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcineurin B homologous protein 2 (Hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 520)
GeneName	CHP2 HCA520
Length	196
Function	Functions as an integral cofactor in cell pH regulation by controlling plasma membrane-type Na(+)/H(+) exchange activity. Binds to and activates SLC9A1/NHE1 in a serum-independent manner, thus increasing pH and protecting cells from serum deprivation-induced death. Also plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumor growth by increasing the phosphatase activity of PPP3CA in a calcium-dependent manner. Activator of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway. Involved in the cytoplasmic translocation of the transcription factor NFATC3 to the nucleus.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cell membrane
