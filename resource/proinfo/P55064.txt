UniprotID	P55064
Accession	P55064;Q6FGW8
EntryName	AQP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aquaporin-5 (AQP-5)
GeneName	AQP5
Length	265
Function	Aquaporins form homotetrameric transmembrane channels, with each monomer independently mediating water transport across the plasma membrane along its osmotic gradient (PubMed:18768791, PubMed:8621489). Plays an important role in fluid secretion in salivary glands (By similarity). Required for TRPV4 activation by hypotonicity. Together with TRPV4, controls regulatory volume decrease in salivary epithelial cells (PubMed:16571723). Seems to play a redundant role in water transport in the eye, lung and in sweat glands (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane; Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane
