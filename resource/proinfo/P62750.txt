UniprotID	P62750
Accession	P62750;B2R5B2;P29316;P39024;Q92774
EntryName	RL23A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein uL23 (60S ribosomal protein L23a)
GeneName	RPL23A
Length	156
Function	Component of the large ribosomal subunit (PubMed:23636399, PubMed:32669547). The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:23636399, PubMed:32669547). Binds a specific region on the 26S rRNA (PubMed:23636399, PubMed:32669547). May promote p53/TP53 degradation possibly through the stimulation of MDM2-mediated TP53 polyubiquitination (PubMed:26203195).
