UniprotID	P62714
Accession	P62714;D3DSV4;P11082;Q6FHK5
EntryName	PP2AB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit beta isoform (PP2A-beta) (EC 3.1.3.16)
GeneName	PPP2CB
Length	309
Function	Catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of a wide variety of enzymes, signal transduction pathways, and cellular events (Probable). PP2A can modulate the activity of phosphorylase B kinase, casein kinase 2, mitogen-stimulated S6 kinase, and MAP-2 kinase. Part of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. STRIPAK complexes have critical roles in protein (de)phosphorylation and are regulators of multiple signaling pathways including Hippo, MAPK, nuclear receptor and cytoskeleton remodeling. Different types of STRIPAK complexes are involved in a variety of biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism and immune regulation (PubMed:18782753).
