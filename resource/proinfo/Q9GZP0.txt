UniprotID	Q9GZP0
Accession	Q9GZP0;A8K9T6;Q9BWV5
EntryName	PDGFD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Platelet-derived growth factor D (PDGF-D) (Iris-expressed growth factor) (Spinal cord-derived growth factor B) (SCDGF-B) [Cleaved into: Platelet-derived growth factor D, latent form (PDGFD latent form); Platelet-derived growth factor D, receptor-binding form (PDGFD receptor-binding form)]
GeneName	PDGFD IEGF SCDGFB MSTP036 UNQ1899/PRO4345
Length	370
Function	Growth factor that plays an essential role in the regulation of embryonic development, cell proliferation, cell migration, survival and chemotaxis. Potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin. Plays an important role in wound healing. Induces macrophage recruitment, increased interstitial pressure, and blood vessel maturation during angiogenesis. Can initiate events that lead to a mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, including influx of monocytes and macrophages and production of extracellular matrix (By similarity).
