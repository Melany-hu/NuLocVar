UniprotID	P13349
Accession	P13349;Q6ISR9
EntryName	MYF5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myogenic factor 5 (Myf-5) (Class C basic helix-loop-helix protein 2) (bHLHc2)
GeneName	MYF5 BHLHC2
Length	255
Function	Transcriptional activator that promotes transcription of muscle-specific target genes and plays a role in muscle differentiation (PubMed:29887215). Together with MYOG and MYOD1, co-occupies muscle-specific gene promoter core region during myogenesis. Induces fibroblasts to differentiate into myoblasts. Probable sequence specific DNA-binding protein.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
