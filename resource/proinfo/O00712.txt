Accession	O00712;G3V1P1;H7BYE8;O00166;Q12858;Q5VW29;Q63HM5;Q6ZNF9;Q96J45
EntryName	NFIB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear factor 1 B-type (NF1-B) (Nuclear factor 1/B) (CCAAT-box-binding transcription factor) (CTF) (Nuclear factor I/B) (NF-I/B) (NFI-B) (TGGCA-binding protein)
GeneName	NFIB
Length	420
Function	Transcriptional activator of GFAP, essential for proper brain development (PubMed:30388402). Recognizes and binds the palindromic sequence 5'-TTGGCNNNNNGCCAA-3' present in viral and cellular promoters and in the origin of replication of adenovirus type 2. These proteins are individually capable of activating transcription and replication.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
