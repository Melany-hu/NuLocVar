EntryName	S2540_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial glutathione transporter SLC25A40 (Mitochondrial carrier family protein) (Solute carrier family 25 member 40)
GeneName	SLC25A40 MCFP
Length	338
Function	Probable mitochondrial transporter required for glutathione import into mitochondria (PubMed:34707288). Glutathione, which plays key roles in oxidative metabolism, is produced exclusively in the cytosol and is imported in many organelles (PubMed:34707288). Mitochondrial glutathione is required for the activity and stability of proteins containing iron-sulfur clusters, as well as erythropoiesis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
