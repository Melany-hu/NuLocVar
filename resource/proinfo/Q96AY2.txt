UniprotID	Q96AY2
Accession	Q96AY2;Q96N62
EntryName	EME1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Crossover junction endonuclease EME1 (EC 3.1.22.-) (MMS4 homolog) (hMMS4)
GeneName	EME1 MMS4
Length	570
Function	Interacts with MUS81 to form a DNA structure-specific endonuclease with substrate preference for branched DNA structures with a 5'-end at the branch nick. Typical substrates include 3'-flap structures, replication forks and nicked Holliday junctions. May be required in mitosis for the processing of stalled or collapsed replication forks.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleolus
