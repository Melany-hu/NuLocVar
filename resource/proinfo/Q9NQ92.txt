UniprotID	Q9NQ92
Accession	Q9NQ92;A6NP14;E1P656;Q96EF5;Q96P75
EntryName	COPRS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Coordinator of PRMT5 and differentiation stimulator (Cooperator of PRMT5) (Protein TTP1)
GeneName	COPRS C17orf79 COPR5
Length	184
Function	Histone-binding protein required for histone H4 methyltransferase activity of PRMT5. Specifically required for histone H4 'Arg-3' methylation mediated by PRMT5, but not histone H3 'Arg-8' methylation, suggesting that it modulates the substrate specificity of PRMT5. Specifically interacts with the N-terminus of histone H4 but not with histone H3, suggesting that it acts by promoting the association between histone H4 and PRMT5. Involved in CCNE1 promoter repression. Plays a role in muscle cell differentiation by modulating the recruitment of PRMT5 to the promoter of genes involved in the coordination between cell cycle exit and muscle differentiation (By similarity).
