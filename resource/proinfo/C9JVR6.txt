UniprotID	C9JVR6
Accession	C9JVR6
EntryName	C9JVR6_HUMAN
ProteinName	EARP and GARP complex-interacting protein 1 (Endosome-associated recycling protein-interacting protein) (Golgi-associated retrograde protein-interacting protein) (Tumor-suppressing STF cDNA 1 protein) (Tumor-suppressing subchromosomal transferable fragment candidate gene 1 protein)
GeneName	EIPR1
Length	178
Function	Acts as a component of endosomal retrieval machinery that is involved in protein transport from early endosomes to either recycling endosomes or the trans-Golgi network. Mediates the recruitment of Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex to the trans-Golgi network and controls early endosome-to-Golgi transport of internalized protein. Promotes the recycling of internalized transferrin receptor (TFRC) to the plasma membrane through interaction with endosome-associated recycling protein (EARP) complex. Controls proper insulin distribution and secretion, and retention of cargo in mature dense core vesicles. Required for the stability of the endosome-associated retrograde protein (EARP) complex subunits and for proper localization and association of EARP with membranes.
