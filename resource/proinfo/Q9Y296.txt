UniprotID	Q9Y296
Accession	Q9Y296;A8K3A5;B4DME1
EntryName	TPPC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trafficking protein particle complex subunit 4 (Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell protein 172) (Synbindin) (TRS23 homolog)
GeneName	TRAPPC4 SBDN CGI-104 HSPC172 PTD009
Length	219
Function	Core component of the TRAPP complexes which has a function of guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity for Rab1 GTPase (Probable). Plays a role in vesicular transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi and autophagy (PubMed:31794024). May play a role in dendrite postsynaptic membrane trafficking (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Postsynaptic cell membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum; Vesicle
