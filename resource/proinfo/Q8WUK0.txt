UniprotID	Q8WUK0
Accession	Q8WUK0;E9PAT8;Q7Z557;Q96CR2;Q9BXV8
EntryName	PTPM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylglycerophosphatase and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1 (EC 3.1.3.27) (PTEN-like phosphatase) (Phosphoinositide lipid phosphatase) (Protein-tyrosine phosphatase mitochondrial 1) (EC 3.1.3.16, EC 3.1.3.48)
GeneName	PTPMT1 MOSP PLIP PNAS-129
Length	201
Function	Lipid phosphatase which dephosphorylates phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP) to phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (By similarity). PGP is an essential intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway of cardiolipin, a mitochondrial-specific phospholipid regulating the membrane integrity and activities of the organelle (By similarity). Has also been shown to display phosphatase activity toward phosphoprotein substrates, specifically mediates dephosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins, thereby playing an essential role in ATP production (By similarity). Has probably a preference for proteins phosphorylated on Ser and/or Thr residues compared to proteins phosphorylated on Tyr residues (By similarity). Probably involved in regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells (By similarity). May prevent intrinsic apoptosis, probably by regulating mitochondrial membrane integrity (PubMed:24709986).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
