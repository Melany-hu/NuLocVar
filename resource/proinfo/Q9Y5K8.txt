UniprotID	Q9Y5K8
Accession	Q9Y5K8;B2RE33;Q9Y688
EntryName	VATD_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit D (V-ATPase subunit D) (V-ATPase 28 kDa accessory protein) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit D)
GeneName	ATP6V1D ATP6M VATD
Length	247
Function	Subunit of the V1 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons (PubMed:33065002). V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment (By similarity). May play a role in cilium biogenesis through regulation of the transport and the localization of proteins to the cilium (PubMed:21844891).
