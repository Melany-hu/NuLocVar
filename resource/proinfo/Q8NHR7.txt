UniprotID	Q8NHR7
Accession	Q8NHR7
EntryName	TERB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Telomere repeats-binding bouquet formation protein 2
GeneName	TERB2 C15orf43
Length	220
Function	Meiosis-specific telomere-associated protein involved in meiotic telomere attachment to the nucleus inner membrane, a crucial step for homologous pairing and synapsis. Component of the MAJIN-TERB1-TERB2 complex, which promotes telomere cap exchange by mediating attachment of telomeric DNA to the inner nuclear membrane and replacement of the protective cap of telomeric chromosomes: in early meiosis, the MAJIN-TERB1-TERB2 complex associates with telomeric DNA and the shelterin/telosome complex. During prophase, the complex matures and promotes release of the shelterin/telosome complex from telomeric DNA.
Subcellular Location	Chromosome; Telomere; Nucleus inner membrane
