EntryName	GBRA6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-6 (GABA(A) receptor subunit alpha-6) (GABAAR subunit alpha-6)
GeneName	GABRA6
Length	453
Function	Alpha subunit of the heteropentameric ligand-gated chloride channel gated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain (PubMed:8632757). GABA-gated chloride channels, also named GABA(A) receptors (GABAAR), consist of five subunits arranged around a central pore and contain GABA active binding site(s) located at the alpha and beta subunit interface(s) (By similarity). When activated by GABA, GABAARs selectively allow the flow of chloride anions across the cell membrane down their electrochemical gradient (By similarity). Alpha-6/GABRA6 subunits are found at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites (PubMed:8632757). Chloride influx into the postsynaptic neuron following GABAAR opening decreases the neuron ability to generate a new action potential, thereby reducing nerve transmission (By similarity). Extrasynaptic alpha-6-containing receptors contribute to the tonic GABAergic inhibition. Alpha-6 subunits are also present on glutamatergic synapses (By similarity).
