UniprotID	Q5JT82
Accession	Q5JT82;Q86VQ7;Q8N805
EntryName	KLF17_HUMAN
ProteinName	Krueppel-like factor 17 (Zinc finger protein 393)
GeneName	KLF17 ZNF393
Length	389
Function	Transcription repressor that binds to the promoter of target genes and prevents their expression. Acts as a negative regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis in breast cancer. Specifically binds the 5'-CACCC-3' sequence in the promoter of ID1, a key metastasis regulator in breast cancer, and repress its expression. May be a germ cell-specific transcription factor that plays important roles in spermatid differentiation and oocyte development (By similarity).
