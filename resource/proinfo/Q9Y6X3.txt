UniprotID	Q9Y6X3
Accession	Q9Y6X3;Q66PT1;Q6P3S7;Q6ZTT2;Q9UFX8
EntryName	SCC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	MAU2 chromatid cohesion factor homolog (MAU-2) (Cohesin loading complex subunit SCC4 homolog)
GeneName	MAU2 KIAA0892 SCC4
Length	613
Function	Plays an important role in the loading of the cohesin complex on to DNA. Forms a heterodimeric complex (also known as cohesin loading complex) with NIPBL/SCC2 which mediates the loading of the cohesin complex onto chromatin (PubMed:22628566, PubMed:28167679). Plays a role in sister chromatid cohesion and normal progression through prometaphase (PubMed:16682347, PubMed:16802858).
