UniprotID	Q96QD8
Accession	Q96QD8;Q6IA88;Q6ZMG2;Q9HAV3;Q9NVA8;Q9P2G5
EntryName	S38A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium-coupled neutral amino acid symporter 2 (Amino acid transporter A2) (Protein 40-9-1) (Solute carrier family 38 member 2) (System A amino acid transporter 2) (System A transporter 1) (System N amino acid transporter 2)
GeneName	SLC38A2 ATA2 KIAA1382 SAT2 SNAT2
Length	506
Function	Symporter that cotransports neutral amino acids and sodium ions from the extracellular to the intracellular side of the cell membrane (PubMed:10930503, PubMed:15774260, PubMed:15922329, PubMed:16621798). The transport is pH-sensitive, Li(+)-intolerant, electrogenic, driven by the Na(+) electrochemical gradient and cotransports of neutral amino acids and sodium ions with a stoichiometry of 1:1. May function in the transport of amino acids at the blood-brain barrier (PubMed:10930503, PubMed:15774260). May function in the transport of amino acids in the supply of maternal nutrients to the fetus through the placenta (By similarity). Maintains a key metabolic glutamine/glutamate balance underpinning retrograde signaling by dendritic release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (By similarity). Transports L-proline in differentiating osteoblasts for the efficient synthesis of proline-enriched proteins and provides proline essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation during bone development (By similarity).
