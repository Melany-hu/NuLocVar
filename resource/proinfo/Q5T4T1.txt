UniprotID	Q5T4T1
Accession	Q5T4T1
EntryName	T170B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 170B
GeneName	TMEM170B
Length	132
Function	Negatively regulates the canonical Wnt signaling in breast cancer cells. Exerts an inhibitory effect on breast cancer growth by inhibiting CTNNB1 stabilization and nucleus translocation, which reduces the activity of Wnt targets (PubMed:29367600).
