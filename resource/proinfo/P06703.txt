UniprotID	P06703
Accession	P06703;D3DV39;Q5RHS4
EntryName	S10A6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein S100-A6 (Calcyclin) (Growth factor-inducible protein 2A9) (MLN 4) (Prolactin receptor-associated protein) (PRA) (S100 calcium-binding protein A6)
GeneName	S100A6 CACY
Length	90
Function	May function as calcium sensor and modulator, contributing to cellular calcium signaling. May function by interacting with other proteins, such as TPR-containing proteins, and indirectly play a role in many physiological processes such as the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and in cell motility. Binds 2 calcium ions. Calcium binding is cooperative.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus envelope; Cytoplasm; Cell membrane
