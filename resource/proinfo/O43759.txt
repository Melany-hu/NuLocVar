UniprotID	O43759
Accession	O43759;A6NP69;A8K0E2;O43757;O43758;Q53Y02;Q96J56;Q9UGZ4
EntryName	SNG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Synaptogyrin-1
GeneName	SYNGR1
Length	233
Function	May play a role in regulated exocytosis. Modulates the localization of synaptophysin/SYP into synaptic-like microvesicles and may therefore play a role in synaptic-like microvesicle formation and/or maturation (By similarity). Involved in the regulation of short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane; Melanosome
