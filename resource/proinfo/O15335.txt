UniprotID	O15335
Accession	O15335;A8K812;Q6GTU0;Q96RJ5
EntryName	CHAD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chondroadherin (Cartilage leucine-rich protein)
GeneName	CHAD SLRR4A
Length	359
Function	Promotes attachment of chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts. This binding is mediated (at least for chondrocytes and fibroblasts) by the integrin alpha(2)beta(1). May play an important role in the regulation of chondrocyte growth and proliferation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Extracellular space; Extracellular matrix
