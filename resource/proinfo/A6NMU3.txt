UniprotID	A6NMU3
Accession	A6NMU3
EntryName	A6NMU3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal transducing adaptor molecule
GeneName	STAM
Length	173
Function	Involved in intracellular signal transduction mediated by cytokines and growth factors. Upon IL-2 and GM-CSL stimulation, it plays a role in signaling leading to DNA synthesis and MYC induction. May also play a role in T-cell development. Involved in down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase via multivesicular body (MVBs) when complexed with HGS (ESCRT-0 complex). The ESCRT-0 complex binds ubiquitin and acts as a sorting machinery that recognizes ubiquitinated receptors and transfers them to further sequential lysosomal sorting/trafficking processes.
