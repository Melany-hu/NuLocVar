UniprotID	Q9NRD5
Accession	Q9NRD5;B3KS52;O95906
EntryName	PICK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	PRKCA-binding protein (Protein interacting with C kinase 1) (Protein kinase C-alpha-binding protein)
GeneName	PICK1 PRKCABP
Length	415
Function	Probable adapter protein that bind to and organize the subcellular localization of a variety of membrane proteins containing some PDZ recognition sequence. Involved in the clustering of various receptors, possibly by acting at the receptor internalization level. Plays a role in synaptic plasticity by regulating the trafficking and internalization of AMPA receptors. May be regulated upon PRKCA activation. May regulate ASIC1/ASIC3 channel. Regulates actin polymerization by inhibiting the actin-nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex; the function is competitive with nucleation promoting factors and is linked to neuronal morphology regulation and AMPA receptor (AMPAR) endocytosis. Via interaction with the Arp2/3 complex involved in regulation of synaptic plasicity of excitatory synapses and required for spine shrinkage during long-term depression (LTD). Involved in regulation of astrocyte morphology, antagonistic to Arp2/3 complex activator WASL/N-WASP function.
