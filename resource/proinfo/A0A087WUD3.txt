UniprotID	A0A087WUD3
Accession	A0A087WUD3
EntryName	A0A087WUD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Oligosaccharyltransferase complex subunit
GeneName	OSTC
Length	83
Function	Specific component of the STT3A-containing form of the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) complex that catalyzes the initial transfer of a defined glycan (Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) in eukaryotes) from the lipid carrier dolichol-pyrophosphate to an asparagine residue within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif in nascent polypeptide chains, the first step in protein N-glycosylation. N-glycosylation occurs cotranslationally and the complex associates with the Sec61 complex at the channel-forming translocon complex that mediates protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). All subunits are required for a maximal enzyme activity. May be involved in N-glycosylation of APP (amyloid-beta precursor protein). Can modulate gamma-secretase cleavage of APP by enhancing endoprotelysis of PSEN1.
