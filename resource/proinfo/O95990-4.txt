UniprotID	O95990-4
Accession	O95990;B3KNQ4;B7ZAY5;J3KR61;Q96NH4
EntryName	F107A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Actin-associated protein FAM107A (Down-regulated in renal cell carcinoma 1) (Protein TU3A)
GeneName	FAM107A DRR1 TU3A
Length	175
Function	Stress-inducible actin-binding protein that plays a role in synaptic and cognitive functions by modulating actin filamentous (F-actin) dynamics. Mediates polymerization of globular actin to F-actin. Also binds to, stabilizes and bundles F-actin. Involved in synaptic function by regulating neurite outgrowth in an actin-dependent manner and for the acquisition of hippocampus-dependent cognitive function, such as learning and long-term memory (By similarity). Plays a role in the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton organization; negatively regulates focal adhesion (FA) assembly promoting malignant glial cell migration in an actin-, microtubule- and MAP1A-dependent manner (PubMed:20543869). Also involved in neuroblastoma G1/S phase cell cycle progression and cell proliferation inhibition by stimulating ubiquitination of NF-kappa-B subunit RELA and NF-kappa-B degradation in a COMMD1- and actin-dependent manner (PubMed:10564580, PubMed:28604741). May play a role in tumor development (PubMed:10564580).
