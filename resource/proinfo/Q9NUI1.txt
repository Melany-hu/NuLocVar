UniprotID	Q9NUI1
Accession	Q9NUI1;Q6ZRS7;Q96ET0
EntryName	DECR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisomal 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase [(3E)-enoyl-CoA-producing] (pDCR) (EC 1.3.1.124) (2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 2) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 17C member 1)
GeneName	DECR2 PDCR SDR17C1
Length	292
Function	Auxiliary enzyme of beta-oxidation. Participates in the degradation of unsaturated fatty enoyl-CoA esters having double bonds in both even- and odd-numbered positions in peroxisome. Catalyzes the NADP-dependent reduction of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA to yield trans-3-enoyl-CoA. Has activity towards short and medium chain 2,4-dienoyl-CoAs, but also towards 2,4,7,10,13,16,19-docosaheptaenoyl-CoA, suggesting that it does not constitute a rate limiting step in the peroxisomal degradation of docosahexaenoic acid.
