EntryName	NDRG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein NDRG2 (N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 protein) (Protein Syld709613)
GeneName	NDRG2 KIAA1248 SYLD
Length	371
Function	Contributes to the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Down-regulates CTNNB1-mediated transcriptional activation of target genes, such as CCND1, and may thereby act as tumor suppressor. May be involved in dendritic cell and neuron differentiation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region; Cell projection; Growth cone
