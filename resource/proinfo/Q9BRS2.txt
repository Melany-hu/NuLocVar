UniprotID	Q9BRS2

EntryName	RIOK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase RIO1 (EC 2.7.11.1) (EC 3.6.3.-) (RIO kinase 1)
GeneName	RIOK1 RIO1
Length	568
Function	Involved in the final steps of cytoplasmic maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Involved in processing of 18S-E pre-rRNA to the mature 18S rRNA. Required for the recycling of NOB1 and PNO1 from the late 40S precursor (PubMed:22072790). The association with the very late 40S subunit intermediate may involve a translation-like checkpoint point cycle preceeding the binding to the 60S ribosomal subunit (By similarity). Despite the protein kinase domain is proposed to act predominantly as an ATPase (By similarity). The catalytic activity regulates its dynamic association with the 40S subunit (By similarity). In addition to its role in ribosomal biogenesis acts as an adapter protein by recruiting NCL/nucleolin the to PRMT5 complex for its symmetrical methylation (PubMed:21081503).
