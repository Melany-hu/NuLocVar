EntryName	CATC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (EC 3.4.14.1) (Cathepsin C) (Cathepsin J) (Dipeptidyl peptidase I) (DPP-I) (DPPI) (Dipeptidyl transferase) [Cleaved into: Dipeptidyl peptidase 1 exclusion domain chain (Dipeptidyl peptidase I exclusion domain chain); Dipeptidyl peptidase 1 heavy chain (Dipeptidyl peptidase I heavy chain); Dipeptidyl peptidase 1 light chain (Dipeptidyl peptidase I light chain)]
GeneName	CTSC CPPI
Length	463
Function	Thiol protease (PubMed:1586157). Has dipeptidylpeptidase activity (PubMed:1586157). Active against a broad range of dipeptide substrates composed of both polar and hydrophobic amino acids (PubMed:1586157). Proline cannot occupy the P1 position and arginine cannot occupy the P2 position of the substrate (PubMed:1586157). Can act as both an exopeptidase and endopeptidase (PubMed:1586157). Activates serine proteases such as elastase, cathepsin G and granzymes A and B (PubMed:8428921).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome
