UniprotID	Q16222
Accession	Q16222;B2R6R8;Q5VTA9;Q5VTB0;Q5VTB1;Q96GM2
EntryName	UAP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	UDP-N-acetylhexosamine pyrophosphorylase (Antigen X) (AGX) (Protein-pyrophosphorylation enzyme) (EC 2.7.4.-) (Sperm-associated antigen 2) (UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine pyrophosphorylase) (EC 2.7.7.83) (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase) (EC 2.7.7.23)
GeneName	UAP1 SPAG2
Length	522
Function	Catalyzes the last step in biosynthesis of uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) by converting UTP and glucosamine 1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1-P) to the sugar nucleotide (PubMed:9603950, PubMed:9765219). Also converts UTP and galactosamine 1-phosphate (GalNAc-1-P) into uridine diphosphate-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) (PubMed:9765219). In addition to its role in metabolism, acts as a regulator of innate immunity in response to virus infection by mediating pyrophosphorylation of IRF3: catalyzes pyrophosphorylation of IRF3 phosphorylated at 'Ser-386' by TBK1, promoting IRF3 dimerization and activation, leading to type I interferon responses (PubMed:36603579).
