UniprotID	Q15003
Accession	Q15003;B4E189;Q8TB87
EntryName	CND2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Condensin complex subunit 2 (Barren homolog protein 1) (Chromosome-associated protein H) (hCAP-H) (Non-SMC condensin I complex subunit H) (XCAP-H homolog)
GeneName	NCAPH BRRN BRRN1 CAPH KIAA0074
Length	741
Function	Regulatory subunit of the condensin complex, a complex required for conversion of interphase chromatin into mitotic-like condense chromosomes. The condensin complex probably introduces positive supercoils into relaxed DNA in the presence of type I topoisomerases and converts nicked DNA into positive knotted forms in the presence of type II topoisomerases (PubMed:11136719). Early in neurogenesis, may play an essential role to ensure accurate mitotic chromosome condensation in neuron stem cells, ultimately affecting neuron pool and cortex size (PubMed:27737959).
