EntryName	TMT1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thiol S-methyltransferase TMT1A (EC 2.1.1.9) (Methyltransferase-like protein 7A) (N6-adenosine-methyltransferase TMT1A) (EC 2.1.1.348) (Protein AAM-B) (Thiol methyltransferase 1A)
GeneName	TMT1A METTL7A PRO0066 UNQ1902/PRO4348
Length	244
Function	Thiol S-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to alkyl and phenolic thiol-containing acceptor substrates. Together with TMT1B accounts for most of S-thiol methylation activity in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes (PubMed:37137720). Able to methylate the N6 position of adenosine residues in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). May facilitate lncRNAs transfer into exosomes at the tumor-stroma interface (PubMed:34980213). Promotes osteogenic and odontogenic differentiation by regulating the expression of genes involved in stem cell differentiation and survival (PubMed:34226523, PubMed:34790668). Targeted from the endoplasmic reticulum to lipid droplets, where it recruits cellular proteins to form functional organelles (PubMed:19773358).
