UniprotID	Q9UI12
Accession	Q9UI12;B3KMR0;Q6PK44;Q9H3E3;Q9Y300
EntryName	VATH_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit H (V-ATPase subunit H) (Nef-binding protein 1) (NBP1) (Protein VMA13 homolog) (V-ATPase 50/57 kDa subunits) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit H) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit SFD)
GeneName	ATP6V1H CGI-11
Length	483
Function	Subunit of the V1 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons (PubMed:33065002). V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment (By similarity). Subunit H is essential for V-ATPase activity, but not for the assembly of the complex (By similarity). Involved in the endocytosis mediated by clathrin-coated pits, required for the formation of endosomes (PubMed:12032142).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane
