UniprotID	P28328
Accession	P28328;Q567S6;Q9BW41
EntryName	PEX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisome biogenesis factor 2 (EC 2.3.2.27) (EC 2.3.2.36) (35 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein) (Peroxin-2) (Peroxisomal membrane protein 3) (Peroxisome assembly factor 1) (PAF-1) (RING finger protein 72)
GeneName	PEX2 PAF1 PMP3 PMP35 PXMP3 RNF72
Length	305
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase component of a retrotranslocation channel required for peroxisome organization by mediating export of the PEX5 receptor from peroxisomes to the cytosol, thereby promoting PEX5 recycling (PubMed:24662292). The retrotranslocation channel is composed of PEX2, PEX10 and PEX12; each subunit contributing transmembrane segments that coassemble into an open channel that specifically allows the passage of PEX5 through the peroxisomal membrane (By similarity). PEX2 also regulates peroxisome organization by acting as a E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (By similarity). PEX2 ubiquitinates PEX5 during its passage through the retrotranslocation channel: catalyzes monoubiquitination of PEX5 at 'Cys-11', a modification that acts as a signal for PEX5 extraction into the cytosol (By similarity). Required for pexophagy in response to starvation by mediating ubiquitination of peroxisomal proteins, such as PEX5 and ABCD3/PMP70 (PubMed:27597759). Also involved in the response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mediating 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PNPLA2/ATGL, thereby regulating lipolysis (PubMed:34903883).
