UniprotID	P60369
Accession	P60369;A3KN67;Q70LJ4
EntryName	KR103_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 10-3 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.3) (Keratin-associated protein 10.3) (Keratin-associated protein 18-3) (Keratin-associated protein 18.3)
GeneName	KRTAP10-3 KAP10.3 KAP18-3 KRTAP10.3 KRTAP18-3 KRTAP18.3
Length	221
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
