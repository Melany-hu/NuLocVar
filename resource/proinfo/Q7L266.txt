UniprotID	Q7L266
Accession	Q7L266;B2R7Q0;Q567Q4;Q6P1P0;Q8NI34;Q9H6F7
EntryName	ASGL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase (EC 3.4.19.5) (EC 3.5.1.1) (Asparaginase-like protein 1) (Beta-aspartyl-peptidase) (Isoaspartyl dipeptidase) (L-asparagine amidohydrolase) [Cleaved into: Isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase alpha chain; Isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase beta chain]
GeneName	ASRGL1 ALP CRASH
Length	308
Function	Has both L-asparaginase and beta-aspartyl peptidase activity. May be involved in the production of L-aspartate, which can act as an excitatory neurotransmitter in some brain regions. Is highly active with L-Asp beta-methyl ester. Besides, has catalytic activity toward beta-aspartyl dipeptides and their methyl esters, including beta-L-Asp-L-Phe, beta-L-Asp-L-Phe methyl ester (aspartame), beta-L-Asp-L-Ala, beta-L-Asp-L-Leu and beta-L-Asp-L-Lys. Does not have aspartylglucosaminidase activity and is inactive toward GlcNAc-L-Asn. Likewise, has no activity toward glutamine.
