UniprotID	Q8N9F7
Accession	Q8N9F7;A8W735;Q56VR1;Q8N4E3
EntryName	GDPD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysophospholipase D GDPD1 (EC 3.1.4.-) (Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 4) (Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	GDPD1 GDE4
Length	314
Function	Hydrolyzes lysoglycerophospholipids to produce lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and the corresponding amines (PubMed:25596343, PubMed:27637550). Shows a preference for 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PAF), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lyso-PE) and lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) (PubMed:25596343, PubMed:27637550). May be involved in bioactive N-acylethanolamine biosynthesis from both N-acyl-lysoplasmenylethanolamin (N-acyl-lysoPlsEt) and N-acyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamin (N-acyl-lysoPE) (PubMed:25596343, PubMed:27637550). In addition, hydrolyzes glycerophospho-N-acylethanolamine to N-acylethanolamine (PubMed:27637550). Does not display glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity, since it cannot hydrolyze either glycerophosphoinositol or glycerophosphocholine (By similarity).
