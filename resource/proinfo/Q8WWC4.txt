UniprotID	Q8WWC4
Accession	Q8WWC4;Q658V9;Q9H671
EntryName	MAIP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	m-AAA protease-interacting protein 1, mitochondrial (Matrix AAA peptidase-interacting protein 1)
GeneName	MAIP1 C2orf47
Length	291
Function	Promotes sorting of SMDT1/EMRE in mitochondria by ensuring its maturation (PubMed:27642048). Interacts with the transit peptide region of SMDT1/EMRE precursor protein in the mitochondrial matrix, leading to protect it against protein degradation by YME1L1, thereby ensuring SMDT1/EMRE maturation by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (PMPCA and PMPCB) (PubMed:27642048).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
