UniprotID	Q8TDN1
Accession	Q8TDN1;Q96H24
EntryName	KCNG4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Voltage-gated potassium channel regulatory subunit KCNG4 (Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily G member 4) (Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv6.3) (Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv6.4)
GeneName	KCNG4 KCNG3
Length	519
Function	Regulatory subunit of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel which, when coassembled with KCNB1, modulates the kinetics parameters of the heterotetrameric channel namely the time course of activation, deactivation and inactivation and on the voltage-dependence of activation (PubMed:12060745, PubMed:19074135). Potassium channel subunit that does not form functional channels by itself (Probable) (PubMed:12060745). Reduces the deactivation rate (PubMed:12060745, PubMed:19074135). Modulates the threshold for activation by shifting by approximately 20 mV in hyperpolarizing direction (PubMed:12060745). Markedly changes the inactivation by shifting the voltage dependence of inactivation by approximately 40 mV in hyperpolarizing direction (PubMed:12060745). Acceleratee activation and enhances the time course of activation (PubMed:12060745).
