Function	Forms paracellular channels: polymerizes in tight junction strands with cation- and water-selective channels through the strands, conveying epithelial permeability in a process known as paracellular tight junction permeability (PubMed:20460438, PubMed:36008380). In intestinal epithelium, allows for sodium and water fluxes from the peritoneal side to the lumen of the intestine to regulate nutrient absorption and clear enteric pathogens as part of mucosal immune response (By similarity). In kidney, allows passive sodium and calcium reabsorption across proximal tubules from the lumen back to the bloodstream (By similarity). In the hepatobiliary tract, allows paracellular water and cation fluxes in the hepatic perivenous areas and biliary epithelium to generate bile flow and maintain osmotic gradients (By similarity).
