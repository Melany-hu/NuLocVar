UniprotID	Q9BZM3
Accession	Q9BZM3
EntryName	GSX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	GS homeobox 2 (Genetic-screened homeobox 2) (Homeobox protein GSH-2)
GeneName	GSX2 GSH2
Length	304
Function	Transcription factor that binds 5'-CNAATTAG-3' DNA sequence and regulates the expression of numerous genes including genes important for brain development (PubMed:31412107). During telencephalic development, causes ventralization of pallial progenitors and, depending on the developmental stage, specifies different neuronal fates. At early stages, necessary and sufficient to correctly specify the ventral lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) and its major derivatives, the striatal projection neurons. At later stages, may specify LGE progenitors toward dorsal LGE fates, including olfactory bulb interneurons (By similarity).
