UniprotID	Q9H756
Accession	Q9H756;A0AV00;B9EG91
EntryName	LRC19_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 19
GeneName	LRRC19
Length	370
Function	Pathogen-recognition receptor which mediates the activation of TRAF2- and TRAF6 NF-kappa-B signaling pathways and induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PubMed:19679103, PubMed:25026888). In kidney, prevents infection by uropathogenic bacteria by inducing the production of cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial substances. In gut, involved in host-microbiota interactions, plays a critical role in promoting the recruitment of immune cells and intestinal inflammation (By similarity).
