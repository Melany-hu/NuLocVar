UniprotID	Q9UJ71
Accession	Q9UJ71
EntryName	CLC4K_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-type lectin domain family 4 member K (Langerin) (CD antigen CD207)
GeneName	CD207 CLEC4K
Length	328
Function	Calcium-dependent lectin displaying mannose-binding specificity. Induces the formation of Birbeck granules (BGs); is a potent regulator of membrane superimposition and zippering. Binds to sulfated as well as mannosylated glycans, keratan sulfate (KS) and beta-glucans. Facilitates uptake of antigens and is involved in the routing and/or processing of antigen for presentation to T cells. Major receptor on primary Langerhans cells for Candida species, Saccharomyces species, and Malassezia furfur. Protects against human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. Binds to high-mannose structures present on the envelope glycoprotein which is followed by subsequent targeting of the virus to the Birbeck granules leading to its rapid degradation.
