UniprotID	Q8N2G4
Accession	Q8N2G4;H7BXW6;Q6ZP52;Q6ZWI4;Q96AC2
EntryName	LYPD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ly6/PLAUR domain-containing protein 1 (Putative HeLa tumor suppressor) (PHTS)
GeneName	LYPD1 Lynx2 LYPDC1 PSEC0181 UNQ3079/PRO9917
Length	141
Function	Believed to act as a modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) activity. In vitro increases receptor desensitization and decreases affinity for ACh of alpha-4:beta-2-containing nAChRs. May play a role in the intracellular trafficking of alpha-4:beta-2 and alpha-7-containing nAChRs and may inhibit their expression at the cell surface. May be involved in the control of anxiety.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
