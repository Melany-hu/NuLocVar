UniprotID	Q08477
Accession	Q08477;B7Z8Z3;O60634;Q5U740
EntryName	CP4F3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 4F3 (EC 1.14.14.1) (20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid synthase) (20-HETE synthase) (CYPIVF3) (Cytochrome P450-LTB-omega) (Docosahexaenoic acid omega-hydroxylase CYP4F3) (EC 1.14.14.79) (Leukotriene-B(4) 20-monooxygenase 2) (Leukotriene-B(4) omega-hydroxylase 2) (EC 1.14.14.94)
GeneName	CYP4F3 LTB4H
Length	520
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids and their oxygenated derivatives (oxylipins) (PubMed:11461919, PubMed:15145985, PubMed:16547005, PubMed:16820285, PubMed:18065749, PubMed:18182499, PubMed:18577768, PubMed:8486631, PubMed:9675028). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR; NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:9675028). May play a role in inactivation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory oxylipins during the resolution of inflammation (PubMed:11461919, PubMed:15145985, PubMed:15364545, PubMed:16547005, PubMed:16820285, PubMed:18065749, PubMed:18182499, PubMed:18577768, PubMed:8486631, PubMed:9675028).
