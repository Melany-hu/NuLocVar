UniprotID	P78382
Accession	P78382;Q5W1L8
EntryName	S35A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	CMP-sialic acid transporter (CMP-SA-Tr) (CMP-Sia-Tr) (CST) (Solute carrier family 35 member A1)
GeneName	SLC35A1
Length	337
Function	Transports CMP-sialic acid from the cytosol into the Golgi apparatus, functioning as an antiporter that exchanges CMP-sialic acid for CMP (PubMed:12682060, PubMed:15576474, PubMed:23873973). Binds both CMP-sialic acid and free CMP, but has higher affinity for free CMP (By similarity). Also able to exchange CMP-sialic acid for AMP and UMP (PubMed:12682060). Also mediates the transport of CDP-ribitol (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Golgi apparatus
