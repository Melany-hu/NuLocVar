UniprotID	Q8IU54
Accession	Q8IU54;A0AV25;Q17R34
EntryName	IFNL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon lambda-1 (IFN-lambda-1) (Cytokine Zcyto21) (Interleukin-29) (IL-29)
GeneName	IFNL1 IL29 ZCYTO21
Length	200
Function	Cytokine with antiviral, antitumour and immunomodulatory activities. Plays a critical role in the antiviral host defense, predominantly in the epithelial tissues. Acts as a ligand for the heterodimeric class II cytokine receptor composed of IL10RB and IFNLR1, and receptor engagement leads to the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway resulting in the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), which mediate the antiviral state. Has a restricted receptor distribution and therefore restricted targets: is primarily active in epithelial cells and this cell type-selective action is because of the epithelial cell-specific expression of its receptor IFNLR1. Exerts an immunomodulatory effect by up-regulating MHC class I antigen expression.
