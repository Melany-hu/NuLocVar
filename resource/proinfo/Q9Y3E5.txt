UniprotID	Q9Y3E5
Accession	Q9Y3E5;B3KUY4;Q9NTE5
EntryName	PTH2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase 2, mitochondrial (PTH 2) (EC 3.1.1.29) (Bcl-2 inhibitor of transcription 1)
GeneName	PTRH2 BIT1 PTH2 CGI-147
Length	179
Function	Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase which releases tRNAs from the ribosome during protein synthesis (PubMed:14660562). Promotes caspase-independent apoptosis by regulating the function of two transcriptional regulators, AES and TLE1.
