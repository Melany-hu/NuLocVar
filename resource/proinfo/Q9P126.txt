UniprotID	Q9P126
Accession	Q9P126;Q6UWX7;Q8NHR6
EntryName	CLC1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-type lectin domain family 1 member B (C-type lectin-like receptor 2) (CLEC-2)
GeneName	CLEC1B CLEC2 UNQ721/PRO1384
Length	229
Function	C-type lectin-like receptor that functions as a platelet receptor for the lymphatic endothelial marker, PDPN (PubMed:18215137). After ligand activation, signals via sequential activation of SRC and SYK tyrosine kinases leading to activation of PLCG2 (PubMed:18955485).
Subcellular Location	Membrane
