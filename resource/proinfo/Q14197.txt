UniprotID	Q14197
Accession	Q14197;B2RAD1;Q53HM7;Q53Y11
EntryName	ICT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein mL62 (39S ribosomal protein L58, mitochondrial) (MRP-L58) (Digestion substraction 1) (DS-1) (Immature colon carcinoma transcript 1 protein) (Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase ICT1, mitochondrial) (EC 3.1.1.29)
GeneName	MRPL58 DS1 ICT1
Length	206
Function	Essential peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (PubMed:20186120, PubMed:33878294). Acts as a codon-independent translation release factor that has lost all stop codon specificity and directs the termination of translation in mitochondrion, possibly in case of abortive elongation (PubMed:33878294). Involved in the hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNAs that have been prematurely terminated and thus in the recycling of stalled mitochondrial ribosomes (PubMed:20186120, PubMed:33878294).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
