UniprotID	O75192
Accession	O75192;B4DV88
EntryName	PX11A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisomal membrane protein 11A (HsPEX11p) (28 kDa peroxisomal integral membrane protein) (PMP28) (Peroxin-11A) (Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11A) (Protein PEX11 homolog alpha) (PEX11-alpha)
GeneName	PEX11A PEX11
Length	247
Function	May be involved in peroxisomal proliferation and may regulate peroxisomes division (PubMed:9792670). May mediate binding of coatomer proteins to the peroxisomal membrane (By similarity). Promotes membrane protrusion and elongation on the peroxisomal surface (PubMed:20826455).
Subcellular Location	Peroxisome membrane
