UniprotID	P08217
Accession	P08217;B2R5I4;Q14243
EntryName	CEL2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chymotrypsin-like elastase family member 2A (EC 3.4.21.71) (Elastase-2A)
GeneName	CELA2A ELA2A
Length	269
Function	Elastase that enhances insulin signaling and might have a physiologic role in cellular glucose metabolism. Circulates in plasma and reduces platelet hyperactivation, triggers both insulin secretion and degradation, and increases insulin sensitivity.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
