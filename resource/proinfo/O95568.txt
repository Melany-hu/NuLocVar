UniprotID	O95568
Accession	O95568;B2R9T5
EntryName	MET18_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histidine protein methyltransferase 1 homolog (EC 2.1.1.85) (Arsenic-transactivated protein 2) (AsTP2) (Methyltransferase-like protein 18)
GeneName	METTL18 ASTP2 C1orf156
Length	372
Function	Protein-L-histidine N-tele-methyltransferase that specifically monomethylates RPL3, thereby regulating translation elongation (PubMed:23349634, PubMed:33693809, PubMed:35674491). Histidine methylation of RPL3 regulates translation elongation by slowing ribosome traversal on tyrosine codons: slower elongation provides enough time for proper folding of synthesized proteins and prevents cellular aggregation of tyrosine-rich proteins (PubMed:35674491).
