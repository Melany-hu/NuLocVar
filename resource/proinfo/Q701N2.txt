UniprotID	Q701N2
Accession	Q701N2;A8MWN2
EntryName	KRA55_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 5-5 (Keratin-associated protein 5-11) (Keratin-associated protein 5.11) (Keratin-associated protein 5.5) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 5.5)
GeneName	KRTAP5-5 KAP5-11 KAP5.5 KRTAP5-11 KRTAP5.11 KRTAP5.5
Length	237
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated protein (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
