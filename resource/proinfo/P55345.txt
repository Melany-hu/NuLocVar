EntryName	ANM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein arginine N-methyltransferase 2 (EC 2.1.1.319) (Histone-arginine N-methyltransferase PRMT2)
GeneName	PRMT2 HMT1 HRMT1L1
Length	433
Function	Arginine methyltransferase that methylates the guanidino nitrogens of arginyl residues in proteins such as STAT3, FBL, histone H4. Acts as a coactivator (with NCOA2) of the androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transactivation. Acts as a coactivator (with estrogen) of estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated transactivation. Enhances PGR, PPARG, RARA-mediated transactivation. May inhibit NF-kappa-B transcription and promote apoptosis. Represses E2F1 transcriptional activity (in a RB1-dependent manner). May be involved in growth regulation.
