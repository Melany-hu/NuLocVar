UniprotID	Q4G0S4
Accession	Q4G0S4;A0A590UJ17;Q6ZNI7
EntryName	C27C1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 27C1 (EC 1.14.19.53) (All-trans retinol 3,4-desaturase)
GeneName	CYP27C1
Length	542
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that catalyzes the 3,4 desaturation of all-trans-retinol (also called vitamin A1) to all-trans-3,4-didehydroretinol (also called vitamin A2) in the skin. Desaturates with lower efficiency all-trans retinal and all-trans retinoic acid. Forms minor amounts of 3-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy all-trans-retinol derivatives. Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate and reducing the second into a water molecule. Two electrons are provided by NADPH via a two-protein mitochondrial transfer system comprising flavoprotein FDXR (adrenodoxin/ferredoxin reductase) and nonheme iron-sulfur protein FDX1 or FDX2 (adrenodoxin/ferredoxin).
