UniprotID	Q8IUC2
Accession	Q8IUC2;Q3LI57
EntryName	KRA81_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 8-1 (High glycine-tyrosine keratin-associated protein 8.1)
GeneName	KRTAP8-1 KAP8.1 KRTAP8.1
Length	63
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
