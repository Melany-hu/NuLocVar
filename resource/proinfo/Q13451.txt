EntryName	FKBP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP5 (PPIase FKBP5) (EC 5.2.1.8) (51 kDa FK506-binding protein) (51 kDa FKBP) (FKBP-51) (54 kDa progesterone receptor-associated immunophilin) (Androgen-regulated protein 6) (FF1 antigen) (FK506-binding protein 5) (FKBP-5) (FKBP54) (p54) (HSP90-binding immunophilin) (Rotamase)
GeneName	FKBP5 AIG6 FKBP51
Length	457
Function	Immunophilin protein with PPIase and co-chaperone activities (PubMed:11350175). Component of unligated steroid receptors heterocomplexes through interaction with heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90). Plays a role in the intracellular trafficking of heterooligomeric forms of steroid hormone receptors maintaining the complex into the cytoplasm when unliganded (PubMed:12538866). Acts as a regulator of Akt/AKT1 activity by promoting the interaction between Akt/AKT1 and PHLPP1, thereby enhancing dephosphorylation and subsequent activation of Akt/AKT1 (PubMed:28147277, PubMed:28363942). Interacts with IKBKE and IKBKB which facilitates IKK complex assembly leading to increased IKBKE and IKBKB kinase activity, NF-kappa-B activation, and IFN production (PubMed:26101251, PubMed:31434731).
