UniprotID	Q63HQ0
Accession	Q63HQ0;B2RCV7;Q96GG6;Q9H0V0;Q9P1L4
EntryName	AP1AR_HUMAN
ProteinName	AP-1 complex-associated regulatory protein (2c18) (Adaptor-related protein complex 1-associated regulatory protein) (Gamma-1-adaptin brefeldin A resistance protein) (GBAR) (Gamma-BAR) (Gamma-A1-adaptin and kinesin interactor) (Gadkin)
GeneName	AP1AR C4orf16 PRO0971
Length	302
Function	Necessary for adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1)-dependent transport between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. Regulates the membrane association of AP1G1/gamma1-adaptin, one of the subunits of the AP-1 adaptor complex. The direct interaction with AP1G1/gamma1-adaptin attenuates the release of the AP-1 complex from membranes. Regulates endosomal membrane traffic via association with AP-1 and KIF5B thus linking kinesin-based plus-end-directed microtubular transport to AP-1-dependent membrane traffic. May act as effector of AP-1 in calcium-induced endo-lysosome secretion. Inhibits Arp2/3 complex function; negatively regulates cell spreading, size and motility via intracellular sequestration of the Arp2/3 complex.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network; Late endosome; Early endosome
