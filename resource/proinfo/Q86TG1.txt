UniprotID	Q86TG1
Accession	Q86TG1;A8K764;B7WPQ9;D6W5L2;Q8N2R6
EntryName	T150A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 150A (Transmembrane protein 150)
GeneName	TMEM150A TMEM150
Length	271
Function	Regulates localization of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) to the plasma membrane, possibly by reducing the association of TTC7 (TTC7A or TTC7B) with the PI4K complex (PubMed:25608530). Acts as a regulator of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) synthesis (PubMed:25608530). May also play a role in fasting-induced catabolism (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
