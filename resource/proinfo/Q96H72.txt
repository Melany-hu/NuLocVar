EntryName	S39AD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc transporter ZIP13 (LIV-1 subfamily of ZIP zinc transporter 9) (LZT-Hs9) (Solute carrier family 39 member 13) (Zrt- and Irt-like protein 13) (ZIP-13)
GeneName	SLC39A13 ZIP13
Length	371
Function	Functions as a zinc transporter transporting Zn(2+) from the Golgi apparatus to the cytosol and thus influences the zinc level at least in areas of the cytosol (PubMed:21917916, PubMed:23213233). May regulate beige adipocyte differentiation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
