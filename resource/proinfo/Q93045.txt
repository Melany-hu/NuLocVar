UniprotID	Q93045
Accession	Q93045;A8K9M2;G3V110;O14952;Q6PK68
EntryName	STMN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Stathmin-2 (Superior cervical ganglion-10 protein) (Protein SCG10)
GeneName	STMN2 SCG10 SCGN10
Length	179
Function	Regulator of microtubule stability. When phosphorylated by MAPK8, stabilizes microtubules and consequently controls neurite length in cortical neurons. In the developing brain, negatively regulates the rate of exit from multipolar stage and retards radial migration from the ventricular zone (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region; Cell projection; Growth cone; Membrane; Cell projection; Axon; Golgi apparatus; Endosome; Cell projection; Lamellipodium
