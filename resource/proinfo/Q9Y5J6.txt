UniprotID	Q9Y5J6
Accession	Q9Y5J6;Q96FF3
EntryName	T10B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim10 B (Fracture callus protein 1) (FxC1) (Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim9 B) (TIMM10B) (Tim10b)
GeneName	TIMM10B FXC1 TIM9B TIMM9B
Length	103
Function	Component of the TIM22 complex, a complex that mediates the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. The TIM22 complex forms a twin-pore translocase that uses the membrane potential as the external driving force. In the TIM22 complex, it may act as a docking point for the soluble 70 kDa complex that guides the target proteins in transit through the aqueous mitochondrial intermembrane space.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
