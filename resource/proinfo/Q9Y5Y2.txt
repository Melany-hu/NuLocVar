UniprotID	Q9Y5Y2
Accession	Q9Y5Y2;D3DU80;Q9NWB2
EntryName	NUBP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly factor NUBP2 (Nucleotide-binding protein 2) (NBP 2)
GeneName	NUBP2
Length	271
Function	Component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe/S) protein assembly (CIA) machinery. Required for maturation of extramitochondrial Fe-S proteins. The NUBP1-NUBP2 heterotetramer forms a Fe-S scaffold complex, mediating the de novo assembly of an Fe-S cluster and its transfer to target apoproteins. Negatively regulates cilium formation and structure.
