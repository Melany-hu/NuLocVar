UniprotID	P50583
Accession	P50583;D3DRM0;Q5T589
EntryName	AP4A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase [asymmetrical] (EC 3.6.1.17) (Diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate asymmetrical hydrolase) (Ap4A hydrolase) (Ap4Aase) (Diadenosine tetraphosphatase) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 2) (Nudix motif 2)
GeneName	NUDT2 APAH1
Length	147
Function	Catalyzes the asymmetric hydrolysis of diadenosine 5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (Ap4A) to yield AMP and ATP (By similarity). Exhibits decapping activity towards FAD-capped RNAs and dpCoA-capped RNAs in vitro (By similarity).
