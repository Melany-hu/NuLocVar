UniprotID	Q14657
Accession	Q14657;Q5HY39;Q8IZ78
EntryName	LAGE3_HUMAN
ProteinName	EKC/KEOPS complex subunit LAGE3 (L antigen family member 3) (Protein ESO-3) (Protein ITBA2)
GeneName	LAGE3 DXS9879E ESO3 ITBA2
Length	143
Function	Component of the EKC/KEOPS complex that is required for the formation of a threonylcarbamoyl group on adenosine at position 37 (t(6)A37) in tRNAs that read codons beginning with adenine (PubMed:22912744, PubMed:27903914). The complex is probably involved in the transfer of the threonylcarbamoyl moiety of threonylcarbamoyl-AMP (TC-AMP) to the N6 group of A37 (PubMed:22912744, PubMed:27903914). LAGE3 functions as a dimerization module for the complex (PubMed:22912744, PubMed:27903914).
