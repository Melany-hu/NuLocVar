UniprotID	Q2I0M4
Accession	Q2I0M4;B9EIR7;C3RUL3;Q5VSG2
EntryName	LRC26_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 26 (BK channel auxiliary gamma subunit LRRC26) (Cytokeratin-associated protein in cancer)
GeneName	LRRC26 CAPC
Length	334
Function	Auxiliary protein of the large-conductance, voltage and calcium-activated potassium channel (BK alpha). Required for the conversion of BK alpha channels from a high-voltage to a low-voltage activated channel type in non-excitable cells. These are characterized by negative membrane voltages and constant low levels of calcium.
