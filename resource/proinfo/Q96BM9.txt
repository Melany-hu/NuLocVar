UniprotID	Q96BM9
Accession	Q96BM9;B3KXD0
EntryName	ARL8A_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 8A (ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 10B) (Novel small G protein indispensable for equal chromosome segregation 2)
GeneName	ARL8A ARL10B GIE2
Length	186
Function	Plays a role in lysosome motility (By similarity). In neurons, mediates the anterograde axonal long-range transport of presynaptic lysosome-related vesicles required for presynaptic biogenesis and synaptic function (By similarity). May play a role in chromosome segregation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Late endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Spindle; Cell projection; Axon; Synapse
