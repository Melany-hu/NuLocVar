EntryName	CHM4C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Charged multivesicular body protein 4c (Chromatin-modifying protein 4c) (CHMP4c) (SNF7 homolog associated with Alix 3) (SNF7-3) (hSnf7-3) (Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 32-3) (Vps32-3) (hVps32-3)
GeneName	CHMP4C SHAX3
Length	233
Function	Probable core component of the endosomal sorting required for transport complex III (ESCRT-III) which is involved in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). Key component of the cytokinesis checkpoint, a process required to delay abscission to prevent both premature resolution of intercellular chromosome bridges and accumulation of DNA damage: upon phosphorylation by AURKB, together with ZFYVE19/ANCHR, retains abscission-competent VPS4 (VPS4A and/or VPS4B) at the midbody ring until abscission checkpoint signaling is terminated at late cytokinesis. Deactivation of AURKB results in dephosphorylation of CHMP4C followed by its dissociation from ANCHR and VPS4 and subsequent abscission (PubMed:22422861, PubMed:24814515). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. Involved in HIV-1 p6- and p9-dependent virus release. CHMP4A/B/C are required for the exosomal release of SDCBP, CD63 and syndecan (PubMed:22660413).
