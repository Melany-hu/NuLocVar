UniprotID	P61018
Accession	P61018;P22750;Q7Z514;Q9HBR6
EntryName	RAB4B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-4B (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB4B RAB4 PP1596
Length	213
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different set of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (By similarity). RAB4B mediates endosomal tethering and fusion through the interaction with RUFY1 and RAB14 (PubMed:20534812). Acts as a regulator of platelet alpha-granule release during activation and aggregation of platelets (By similarity).
