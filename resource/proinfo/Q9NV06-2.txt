Accession	Q9NV06;Q3MII9;Q8NCH8;Q8TC51;Q96JY7;Q9NZX3
EntryName	DCA13_HUMAN
ProteinName	DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 13 (WD repeat and SOF domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	DCAF13 WDSOF1 HSPC064
Length	96
Function	Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797). Participates in the 18S rRNA processing in growing oocytes, being essential for oocyte nonsurrounded nucleolus (NSN) to surrounded nucleolus (SN) transition (PubMed:30283081).
