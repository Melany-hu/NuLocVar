UniprotID	Q8WYK2
Accession	Q8WYK2;J3KN58;O95430;Q9UIE4
EntryName	JDP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Jun dimerization protein 2
GeneName	JDP2
Length	163
Function	Component of the AP-1 transcription factor that represses transactivation mediated by the Jun family of proteins. Involved in a variety of transcriptional responses associated with AP-1 such as UV-induced apoptosis, cell differentiation, tumorigenesis and antitumogeneris. Can also function as a repressor by recruiting histone deacetylase 3/HDAC3 to the promoter region of JUN. May control transcription via direct regulation of the modification of histones and the assembly of chromatin.
