UniprotID	Q6ZSG2
Accession	Q6ZSG2;B2RNT4;B7ZME7
EntryName	INSY2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inhibitory synaptic factor 2A (InSyn2)
GeneName	INSYN2A C10orf141 FAM196A INSYN2
Length	479
Function	Component of the protein machinery at the inhibitory synapses, probably acting as a scaffold. Inhibitory synapses dampen neuronal activity through postsynaptic hyperpolarization. This synaptic inhibition is fundamental for the functioning of the central nervous system, shaping and orchestrating the flow of information through neuronal networks to generate a precise neural code.
