EntryName	CASP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caspase-2 (CASP-2) (EC 3.4.22.55) (Neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 2) (NEDD-2) (Protease ICH-1) [Cleaved into: Caspase-2 subunit p18; Caspase-2 subunit p13; Caspase-2 subunit p12]
GeneName	CASP2 ICH1 NEDD2
Length	452
Function	Is a regulator of the cascade of caspases responsible for apoptosis execution (PubMed:11156409, PubMed:15073321, PubMed:8087842). Might function by either activating some proteins required for cell death or inactivating proteins necessary for cell survival (PubMed:15073321). Associates with PIDD1 and CRADD to form the PIDDosome, a complex that activates CASP2 and triggers apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress (PubMed:15073321).
