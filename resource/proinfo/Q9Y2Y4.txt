UniprotID	Q9Y2Y4
Accession	Q9Y2Y4;Q8WVP2
EntryName	ZBT32_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 32 (FANCC-interacting protein) (Fanconi anemia zinc finger protein) (Testis zinc finger protein) (Zinc finger protein 538)
GeneName	ZBTB32 FAZF TZFP ZNF538
Length	487
Function	DNA-binding protein that binds to the to a 5'-TGTACAGTGT-3' core sequence. May function as a transcriptional transactivator and transcriptional repressor. Probably exerts its repressor effect by preventing GATA3 from binding to DNA. May play a role in regulating the differentiation and activation of helper T-cells (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
