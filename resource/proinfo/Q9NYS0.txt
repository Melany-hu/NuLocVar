UniprotID	Q9NYS0
Accession	Q9NYS0;Q96K18
EntryName	KBRS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	NF-kappa-B inhibitor-interacting Ras-like protein 1 (I-kappa-B-interacting Ras-like protein 1) (Kappa B-Ras protein 1) (KappaB-Ras1)
GeneName	NKIRAS1 KBRAS1
Length	192
Function	Atypical Ras-like protein that acts as a potent regulator of NF-kappa-B activity by preventing the degradation of NF-kappa-B inhibitor beta (NFKBIB) by most signals, explaining why NFKBIB is more resistant to degradation. May act by blocking phosphorylation of NFKBIB and mediating cytoplasmic retention of p65/RELA NF-kappa-B subunit. It is unclear whether it acts as a GTPase. Both GTP- and GDP-bound forms block phosphorylation of NFKBIB.
