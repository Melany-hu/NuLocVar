UniprotID	Q9NX61
Accession	Q9NX61;B3KUE0;G5E9M6;Q7L2Y1
EntryName	T161A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 161A (Adaptive response to oxidative stress protein 29) (AROS-29)
GeneName	TMEM161A UNQ582/PRO1152
Length	479
Function	May play a role in protection against oxidative stress. Overexpression leads to reduced levels of oxidant-induced DNA damage and apoptosis.
