UniprotID	Q96L46
Accession	Q96L46;Q9BPV4
EntryName	CPNS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calpain small subunit 2 (CSS2) (Calcium-dependent protease small subunit 2)
GeneName	CAPNS2
Length	248
Function	Calcium-regulated non-lysosomal thiol-protease which catalyzes limited proteolysis of substrates involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and signal transduction. This small subunit may act as a tissue-specific chaperone of the large subunit, possibly by helping it fold into its correct conformation for activity.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cell membrane
