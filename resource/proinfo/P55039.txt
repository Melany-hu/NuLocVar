UniprotID	P55039
Accession	P55039;B2R8G5;Q53Y50;Q9BWB2
EntryName	DRG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Developmentally-regulated GTP-binding protein 2 (DRG-2) (Translation factor GTPase DRG2) (TRAFAC GTPase DRG2) (EC 3.6.5.-)
GeneName	DRG2
Length	364
Function	Catalyzes the conversion of GTP to GDP through hydrolysis of the gamma-phosphate bond in GTP. When hydroxylated at C-3 of 'Lys-21' by JMJD7, may bind to RNA and play a role in translation.
