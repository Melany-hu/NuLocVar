Accession	Q8IUG1;Q07628;Q8IUG0;Q9BYS2
EntryName	KRA13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 1-3 (Keratin-associated protein 1.8) (Keratin-associated protein 1.9)
GeneName	KRTAP1-3 B2B KAP1.2 KAP1.3 KAP1.8 KAP1.9 KRATP1.9 KRTAP1.8
Length	167
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
