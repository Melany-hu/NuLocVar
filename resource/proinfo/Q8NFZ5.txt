EntryName	TNIP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	TNFAIP3-interacting protein 2 (A20-binding inhibitor of NF-kappa-B activation 2) (ABIN-2) (Fetal liver LKB1-interacting protein)
GeneName	TNIP2 ABIN2 FLIP1
Length	429
Function	Inhibits NF-kappa-B activation by blocking the interaction of RIPK1 with its downstream effector NEMO/IKBKG. Forms a ternary complex with NFKB1 and MAP3K8 but appears to function upstream of MAP3K8 in the TLR4 signaling pathway that regulates MAP3K8 activation. Involved in activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway during innate immune response; this function seems to be stimulus- and cell type specific. Required for stability of MAP3K8. Involved in regulation of apoptosis in endothelial cells; promotes TEK agonist-stimulated endothelial survival. May act as transcriptional coactivator when translocated to the nucleus. Enhances CHUK-mediated NF-kappa-B activation involving NF-kappa-B p50-p65 and p50-c-Rel complexes.
