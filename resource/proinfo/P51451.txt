UniprotID	P51451
Accession	P51451;Q16291;Q96IN1
EntryName	BLK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tyrosine-protein kinase Blk (EC 2.7.10.2) (B lymphocyte kinase) (p55-Blk)
GeneName	BLK
Length	505
Function	Non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in B-lymphocyte development, differentiation and signaling (By similarity). B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling requires a tight regulation of several protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, and associated coreceptors (By similarity). Binding of antigen to the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) triggers signaling that ultimately leads to B-cell activation (By similarity). Signaling through BLK plays an important role in transmitting signals through surface immunoglobulins and supports the pro-B to pre-B transition, as well as the signaling for growth arrest and apoptosis downstream of B-cell receptor (By similarity). Specifically binds and phosphorylates CD79A at 'Tyr-188'and 'Tyr-199', as well as CD79B at 'Tyr-196' and 'Tyr-207' (By similarity). Also phosphorylates the immunoglobulin G receptors FCGR2A, FCGR2B and FCGR2C (PubMed:8756631). With FYN and LYN, plays an essential role in pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR)-mediated NF-kappa-B activation (By similarity). Also contributes to BTK activation by indirectly stimulating BTK intramolecular autophosphorylation (By similarity). In pancreatic islets, acts as a modulator of beta-cells function through the up-regulation of PDX1 and NKX6-1 and consequent stimulation of insulin secretion in response to glucose (PubMed:19667185). Phosphorylates CGAS, promoting retention of CGAS in the cytosol (PubMed:30356214).
