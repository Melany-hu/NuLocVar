UniprotID	Q13155
Accession	Q13155;F8W950;Q75MR1;Q96CZ5;Q9P1L2
EntryName	AIMP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aminoacyl tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (Multisynthase complex auxiliary component p38) (Protein JTV-1)
GeneName	AIMP2 JTV1 PRO0992
Length	320
Function	Required for assembly and stability of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthase complex (PubMed:19131329). Mediates ubiquitination and degradation of FUBP1, a transcriptional activator of MYC, leading to MYC down-regulation which is required for aveolar type II cell differentiation. Blocks MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53/TP53. Functions as a proapoptotic factor.
