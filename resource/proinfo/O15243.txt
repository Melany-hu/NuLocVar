UniprotID	O15243
Accession	O15243;Q6FHL5
EntryName	OBRG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leptin receptor gene-related protein (Endospanin-1) (Leptin receptor overlapping transcript protein) (OB-R gene-related protein) (OB-RGRP)
GeneName	LEPROT LEPR OBR
Length	131
Function	Negatively regulates leptin receptor (LEPR) cell surface expression, and thus decreases response to leptin. Negatively regulates growth hormone (GH) receptor cell surface expression in liver. May play a role in liver resistance to GH during periods of reduced nutrient availability.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Endosome membrane
