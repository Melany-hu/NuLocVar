UniprotID	Q9NWA0
Accession	Q9NWA0
EntryName	MED9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 9 (Mediator complex subunit 9)
GeneName	MED9 MED25
Length	146
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
