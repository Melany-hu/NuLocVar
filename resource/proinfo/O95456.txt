UniprotID	O95456
Accession	O95456;B5BUN2;Q6FHA3;Q6FHD3;Q6S713
EntryName	PSMG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteasome assembly chaperone 1 (PAC-1) (Chromosome 21 leucine-rich protein) (C21-LRP) (Down syndrome critical region protein 2) (Proteasome chaperone homolog 1) (Pba1)
GeneName	PSMG1 C21LRP DSCR2 PAC1
Length	288
Function	Chaperone protein which promotes assembly of the 20S proteasome as part of a heterodimer with PSMG2. The PSMG1-PSMG2 heterodimer binds to the PSMA5 and PSMA7 proteasome subunits, promotes assembly of the proteasome alpha subunits into the heteroheptameric alpha ring and prevents alpha ring dimerization.
