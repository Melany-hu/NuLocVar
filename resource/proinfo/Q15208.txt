UniprotID	Q15208
Accession	Q15208;Q503A1
EntryName	STK38_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase 38 (EC 2.7.11.1) (NDR1 protein kinase) (Nuclear Dbf2-related kinase 1)
GeneName	STK38 NDR1
Length	465
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase that acts as a negative regulator of MAP3K1/2 signaling (PubMed:12493777, PubMed:15197186, PubMed:17906693, PubMed:7761441). Converts MAP3K2 from its phosphorylated form to its non-phosphorylated form and inhibits autophosphorylation of MAP3K2 (PubMed:12493777, PubMed:15197186, PubMed:17906693, PubMed:7761441). Acts as an ufmylation 'reader' in a kinase-independent manner: specifically recognizes and binds mono-ufmylated histone H4 in response to DNA damage, promoting the recruitment of SUV39H1 to the double-strand breaks, resulting in ATM activation (PubMed:32537488).
