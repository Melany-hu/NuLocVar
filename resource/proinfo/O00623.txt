EntryName	PEX12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisome assembly protein 12 (Peroxin-12) (Peroxisome assembly factor 3) (PAF-3)
GeneName	PEX12 PAF3
Length	359
Function	Component of a retrotranslocation channel required for peroxisome organization by mediating export of the PEX5 receptor from peroxisomes to the cytosol, thereby promoting PEX5 recycling (PubMed:24662292, PubMed:9354782, PubMed:9632816). The retrotranslocation channel is composed of PEX2, PEX10 and PEX12; each subunit contributing transmembrane segments that coassemble into an open channel that specifically allows the passage of PEX5 through the peroxisomal membrane (By similarity). PEX12 also regulates PEX5 recycling by activating the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of PEX10 (PubMed:24662292). When PEX5 recycling is compromised, PEX12 stimulates PEX10-mediated polyubiquitination of PEX5, leading to its subsequent degradation (By similarity).
