UniprotID	A8MW99
Accession	A8MW99;R4GMV8
EntryName	MEI4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Meiosis-specific protein MEI4
GeneName	MEI4
Length	385
Function	Required for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) formation in unsynapsed regions during meiotic recombination. Probably acts by forming a complex with IHO1 and REC114, which activates DSBs formation in unsynapsed regions, an essential step to ensure completion of synapsis.
