UniprotID	O95178
Accession	O95178;Q6FGI6
EntryName	NDUB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 2, mitochondrial (Complex I-AGGG) (CI-AGGG) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase AGGG subunit)
GeneName	NDUFB2
Length	105
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
