UniprotID	P51993
Accession	P51993;A6NEX0;D6W637;Q9UND8
EntryName	FUT6_HUMAN
ProteinName	4-galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminide 3-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase FUT6 (EC 2.4.1.152) (Fucosyltransferase 6) (Fucosyltransferase VI) (Fuc-TVI) (FucT-VI) (Galactoside 3-L-fucosyltransferase)
GeneName	FUT6 FCT3A
Length	359
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of L-fucose, from a guanosine diphosphate-beta-L-fucose, to the N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) of a distal alpha2,3 sialylated lactosamine unit of a glycoprotein- or a glycolipid-linked sialopolylactosamines chain or of a distal or internal lactosamine unit of a neutral glycoprotein- or a glycolipid-linked polylactosamines chain through an alpha-1,3 glycosidic linkage and participates in surface expression of the sialyl Lewis X (sLe(x)), Lewis X (Le(x)) and non sialylated VIM2 determinants (PubMed:10728707, PubMed:1339443, PubMed:1520296, PubMed:17604274, PubMed:29593094, PubMed:7650030, PubMed:9363434, PubMed:9451035). Moreover transfers fucose to H-type 2 (Fucalpha1-2Galbeta1-4GlcNAc) chain acceptor substrates and participates in difucosylated sialyl Lewis x determinants (PubMed:1339443, PubMed:17604274). Also fucosylates a polylactosamine substrate having a 6 sulfate modification at the GlcNAc moiety and gives rise to sialyl and non-sialyl 6-sulfo lewis X (PubMed:10728707). Does not have activity towards type 1 ((Galbeta1-3GlcNAc)) and H-type 1 chain (Fucalpha1-2Galbeta1-3GlcNAc) acceptors substrates (PubMed:1339443, PubMed:17604274, PubMed:9363434).
