UniprotID	O15145
Accession	O15145;O00554
EntryName	ARPC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 3 (Arp2/3 complex 21 kDa subunit) (p21-ARC)
GeneName	ARPC3 ARC21
Length	178
Function	Component of the Arp2/3 complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates actin polymerization upon stimulation by nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) (PubMed:9230079). The Arp2/3 complex mediates the formation of branched actin networks in the cytoplasm, providing the force for cell motility (PubMed:9230079). In addition to its role in the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, the Arp2/3 complex also promotes actin polymerization in the nucleus, thereby regulating gene transcription and repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:29925947). The Arp2/3 complex promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair in response to DNA damage by promoting nuclear actin polymerization, leading to drive motility of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:29925947).
