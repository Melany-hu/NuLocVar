UniprotID	Q96PF2
Accession	Q96PF2;Q8IY55
EntryName	TSSK2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (TSK-2) (TSK2) (TSSK-2) (Testis-specific kinase 2) (EC 2.7.11.1) (DiGeorge syndrome protein G) (DGS-G) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase 22B)
GeneName	TSSK2 DGSG SPOGA2 STK22B
Length	358
Function	Testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase required during spermatid development. Phosphorylates TSKS at 'Ser-288' and SPAG16. Involved in the late stages of spermatogenesis, during the reconstruction of the cytoplasm. During spermatogenesis, required for the transformation of a ring-shaped structure around the base of the flagellum originating from the chromatoid body.
