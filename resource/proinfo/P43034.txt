UniprotID	P43034
Accession	P43034;B2R7Q7;Q8WZ88;Q8WZ89
EntryName	LIS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase IB subunit beta (Lissencephaly-1 protein) (LIS-1) (PAF acetylhydrolase 45 kDa subunit) (PAF-AH 45 kDa subunit) (PAF-AH alpha) (PAFAH alpha)
GeneName	PAFAH1B1 LIS1 MDCR MDS PAFAHA
Length	410
Function	Regulatory subunit (beta subunit) of the cytosolic type I platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH (I)), an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolyze of the acetyl group at the sn-2 position of PAF and its analogs and participates in PAF inactivation. Regulates the PAF-AH (I) activity in a catalytic dimer composition-dependent manner (By similarity). Required for proper activation of Rho GTPases and actin polymerization at the leading edge of locomoting cerebellar neurons and postmigratory hippocampal neurons in response to calcium influx triggered via NMDA receptors (By similarity). Positively regulates the activity of the minus-end directed microtubule motor protein dynein. May enhance dynein-mediated microtubule sliding by targeting dynein to the microtubule plus end. Required for several dynein- and microtubule-dependent processes such as the maintenance of Golgi integrity, the peripheral transport of microtubule fragments and the coupling of the nucleus and centrosome. Required during brain development for the proliferation of neuronal precursors and the migration of newly formed neurons from the ventricular/subventricular zone toward the cortical plate. Neuronal migration involves a process called nucleokinesis, whereby migrating cells extend an anterior process into which the nucleus subsequently translocates. During nucleokinesis dynein at the nuclear surface may translocate the nucleus towards the centrosome by exerting force on centrosomal microtubules. May also play a role in other forms of cell locomotion including the migration of fibroblasts during wound healing. Required for dynein recruitment to microtubule plus ends and BICD2-bound cargos (PubMed:22956769). May modulate the Reelin pathway through interaction of the PAF-AH (I) catalytic dimer with VLDLR (By similarity).
