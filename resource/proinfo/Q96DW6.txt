Accession	Q96DW6;A1LP07;Q9NWX2
EntryName	S2538_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial glycine transporter (Appoptosin) (Mitochondrial glycine transporter GlyC) (Solute carrier family 25 member 38)
GeneName	SLC25A38
Length	304
Function	Mitochondrial glycine transporter that imports glycine into the mitochondrial matrix. Plays an important role in providing glycine for the first enzymatic step in heme biosynthesis, the condensation of glycine with succinyl-CoA to produce 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) in the mitochondrial matrix. Required during erythropoiesis.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
