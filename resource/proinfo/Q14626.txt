UniprotID	Q14626
Accession	Q14626;Q16542;Q5VZ80;Q7KYJ7
EntryName	I11RA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-11 receptor subunit alpha (IL-11 receptor subunit alpha) (IL-11R subunit alpha) (IL-11R-alpha) (IL-11RA) [Cleaved into: Soluble interleukin-11 receptor subunit alpha (sIL-11R) (sIL-11RA) (sIL11RA)]
GeneName	IL11RA
Length	422
Function	Receptor for interleukin-11 (IL11). The receptor systems for IL6, LIF, OSM, CNTF, IL11 and CT1 can utilize IL6ST for initiating signal transmission. The IL11/IL11RA/IL6ST complex may be involved in the control of proliferation and/or differentiation of skeletogenic progenitor or other mesenchymal cells (Probable). Essential for the normal development of craniofacial bones and teeth. Restricts suture fusion and tooth number.
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Secreted; Secreted
