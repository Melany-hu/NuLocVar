UniprotID	P29622
Accession	P29622;Q53XB5;Q86TR9;Q96BZ5
EntryName	KAIN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kallistatin (Kallikrein inhibitor) (Peptidase inhibitor 4) (PI-4) (Serpin A4)
GeneName	SERPINA4 KST PI4
Length	427
Function	Inhibits human amidolytic and kininogenase activities of tissue kallikrein. Inhibition is achieved by formation of an equimolar, heat- and SDS-stable complex between the inhibitor and the enzyme, and generation of a small C-terminal fragment of the inhibitor due to cleavage at the reactive site by tissue kallikrein.
