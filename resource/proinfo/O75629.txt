UniprotID	O75629
Accession	O75629;B2RDD4;Q8N9A3
EntryName	CREG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein CREG1 (Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes 1)
GeneName	CREG1 CREG UNQ727/PRO1409
Length	220
Function	May contribute to the transcriptional control of cell growth and differentiation. Antagonizes transcriptional activation and cellular transformation by the adenovirus E1A protein. The transcriptional control activity of cell growth requires interaction with IGF2R.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
