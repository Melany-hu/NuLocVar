UniprotID	Q9HA64
Accession	Q9HA64;Q969F4;Q9H0U7
EntryName	KT3K_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ketosamine-3-kinase (EC 2.7.1.172) (Fructosamine-3-kinase-related protein) (FN3K-RP) (FN3K-related protein) (Protein-psicosamine 3-kinase FN3KRP) (EC 2.7.1.-)
GeneName	FN3KRP
Length	309
Function	Ketosamine-3-kinase involved in protein deglycation by mediating phosphorylation of ribuloselysine and psicoselysine on glycated proteins, to generate ribuloselysine-3 phosphate and psicoselysine-3 phosphate, respectively (PubMed:14633848, PubMed:15137908). Ribuloselysine-3 phosphate and psicoselysine-3 phosphate adducts are unstable and decompose under physiological conditions (PubMed:14633848, PubMed:15137908). Not able to phosphorylate fructoselysine (PubMed:14633848).
