UniprotID	Q96AA3
Accession	Q96AA3;Q96J03
EntryName	RFT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol translocation protein RFT1 (Protein RFT1 homolog)
GeneName	RFT1
Length	541
Function	Intramembrane glycolipid transporter that operates in the biosynthetic pathway of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, the glycan precursors employed in protein asparagine (N)-glycosylation. The sequential addition of sugars to dolichol pyrophosphate produces dolichol-linked oligosaccharides containing fourteen sugars, including two GlcNAcs, nine mannoses and three glucoses. Once assembled, the oligosaccharide is transferred from the lipid to nascent proteins by oligosaccharyltransferases. The assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides begins on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and finishes in its lumen. RFT1 could mediate the translocation of the cytosolically oriented intermediate DolPP-GlcNAc2Man5, produced by ALG11, into the ER lumen where dolichol-linked oligosaccharides assembly continues (PubMed:18313027, PubMed:19701946). However, the intramembrane lipid transporter activity could not be confirmed in vitro (By similarity).
