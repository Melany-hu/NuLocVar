UniprotID	P37198
Accession	P37198;B3KWU5;Q503A4;Q6GTM2;Q96C43;Q9NSL1
EntryName	NUP62_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear pore glycoprotein p62 (62 kDa nucleoporin) (Nucleoporin Nup62)
GeneName	NUP62
Length	522
Function	Essential component of the nuclear pore complex (PubMed:1915414). The N-terminal is probably involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport (PubMed:1915414). The C-terminal is involved in protein-protein interaction probably via coiled-coil formation, promotes its association with centrosomes and may function in anchorage of p62 to the pore complex (PubMed:1915414, PubMed:24107630). Plays a role in mitotic cell cycle progression by regulating centrosome segregation, centriole maturation and spindle orientation (PubMed:24107630). It might be involved in protein recruitment to the centrosome after nuclear breakdown (PubMed:24107630).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nuclear pore complex; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Spindle pole; Nucleus envelope; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome
