Function	Plays a critical role in the phospholipid salvage pathway from lysosomes to the cytosol (PubMed:36161949, PubMed:37075117). Mediates the rate-limiting, proton-dependent, lysosomal efflux of lysophospholipids, which can then be reacylated by acyltransferases in the endoplasmic reticulum to form phospholipids (PubMed:36161949, PubMed:37075117). Selective for zwitterionic headgroups such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), can also transport lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG), but not other anionic lysophospholipids, sphingosine, nor sphingomyelin (PubMed:36161949). Transports lysophospholipids with saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as 1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, respectively (PubMed:36161949, PubMed:37075117). Can also transport lysoplasmalogen (LPC with a fatty alcohol) such as 1-(1Z-hexadecenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PubMed:36161949). Lysosomal LPC could function as intracellular signaling messenger (PubMed:37075117). Essential player in lysosomal homeostasis (PubMed:36161949). Crucial for cell survival under conditions of nutrient limitation (PubMed:37075117). May be involved in necrotic or autophagic cell death (PubMed:12815463).
