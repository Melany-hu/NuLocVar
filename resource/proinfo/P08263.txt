EntryName	GSTA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutathione S-transferase A1 (EC 2.5.1.18) (13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoate peroxidase) (EC 1.11.1.-) (Androst-5-ene-3,17-dione isomerase) (EC 5.3.3.-) (GST HA subunit 1) (GST class-alpha member 1) (GST-epsilon) (GSTA1-1) (GTH1) [Cleaved into: Glutathione S-transferase A1, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	GSTA1
Length	222
Function	Glutathione S-transferase that catalyzes the nucleophilic attack of the sulfur atom of glutathione on the electrophilic groups of a wide range of exogenous and endogenous compounds (Probable). Involved in the formation of glutathione conjugates of both prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) and prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) (PubMed:9084911). It also catalyzes the isomerization of D5-androstene-3,17-dione (AD) into D4-androstene-3,17-dione and may therefore play an important role in hormone biosynthesis (PubMed:11152686). Through its glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity toward the fatty acid hydroperoxide (13S)-hydroperoxy-(9Z,11E)-octadecadienoate/13-HPODE it is also involved in the metabolism of oxidized linoleic acid (PubMed:16624487).
