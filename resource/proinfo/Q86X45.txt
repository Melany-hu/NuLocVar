UniprotID	Q86X45
Accession	Q86X45;Q13648;Q4G183
EntryName	DAA11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynein axonemal assembly factor 11 (DNAAF11) (Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 6) (Leucine-rich testis-specific protein) (Protein tilB homolog) (Testis-specific leucine-rich repeat protein)
GeneName	DNAAF11 LRRC6 LRTP TSLRP
Length	466
Function	Involved in dynein arm assembly, is important for expression and transporting outer dynein arm (ODA) proteins from the cytoplasm to the cilia (PubMed:23122589, PubMed:23527195, PubMed:33403504). Acts as a crucial component in the formation and motility of spermatozoal flagella (PubMed:33403504).
