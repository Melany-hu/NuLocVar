UniprotID	O75563
Accession	O75563;A4D173;Q53GP6;Q75MK6;Q75MZ4;Q9UBZ3;Q9UED8
EntryName	SKAP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 2 (Pyk2/RAFTK-associated protein) (Retinoic acid-induced protein 70) (SKAP55 homolog) (SKAP-55HOM) (SKAP-HOM) (Src family-associated phosphoprotein 2) (Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 55-related protein) (Src-associated adapter protein with PH and SH3 domains)
GeneName	SKAP2 PRAP RA70 SAPS SCAP2 SKAP55R
Length	359
Function	May be involved in B-cell and macrophage adhesion processes. In B-cells, may act by coupling the B-cell receptor (BCR) to integrin activation. May play a role in src signaling pathway.
