UniprotID	Q9BUP3
Accession	Q9BUP3;A8K7S7;D3DQY8;O15383;O60520;O95345;Q53GC1;Q53GG2;Q6IBI3
EntryName	HTAI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Oxidoreductase HTATIP2 (EC 1.1.1.-) (30 kDa HIV-1 TAT-interacting protein) (HIV-1 TAT-interactive protein 2)
GeneName	HTATIP2 CC3 TIP30
Length	242
Function	Oxidoreductase required for tumor suppression. NADPH-bound form inhibits nuclear import by competing with nuclear import substrates for binding to a subset of nuclear transport receptors. May act as a redox sensor linked to transcription through regulation of nuclear import. Isoform 1 is a metastasis suppressor with proapoptotic as well as antiangiogenic properties. Isoform 2 has an antiapoptotic effect.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus envelope
