UniprotID	Q99816
Accession	Q99816;Q9BUM5
EntryName	TS101_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor susceptibility gene 101 protein (ESCRT-I complex subunit TSG101)
GeneName	TSG101
Length	390
Function	Component of the ESCRT-I complex, a regulator of vesicular trafficking process. Binds to ubiquitinated cargo proteins and is required for the sorting of endocytic ubiquitinated cargos into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Mediates the association between the ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I complex. Required for completion of cytokinesis; the function requires CEP55. May be involved in cell growth and differentiation. Acts as a negative growth regulator. Involved in the budding of many viruses through an interaction with viral proteins that contain a late-budding motif P--A-P. This interaction is essential for viral particle budding of numerous retroviruses. Required for the exosomal release of SDCBP, CD63 and syndecan (PubMed:22660413). It may also play a role in the extracellular release of microvesicles that differ from the exosomes (PubMed:22315426).
