UniprotID	Q8NEB5
Accession	Q8NEB5;C9JKF5;Q3KQX6;Q9BY45
EntryName	PLPP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholipid phosphatase 5 (EC 3.1.3.4) (EC 3.6.1.75) (Phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 domain-containing protein 1B)
GeneName	PLPP5 DPPL1 HTPAP PPAPDC1B
Length	264
Function	Magnesium-independent phospholipid phosphatase with broad substrate specificity (PubMed:17590538). Preferentially catalyzes the conversion of diacylglycerol pyrophosphate into phosphatidate but can also act on phosphatidate and lysophosphatidate (PubMed:17590538). Phospholipid phosphatases are involved in both the synthesis of lipids and the generation or degradation of lipid-signaling molecules (PubMed:17590538).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
