UniprotID	Q13185
Accession	Q13185;Q96CD7;Q99409;Q9BVS3;Q9P0Z6
EntryName	CBX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chromobox protein homolog 3 (HECH) (Heterochromatin protein 1 homolog gamma) (HP1 gamma) (Modifier 2 protein)
GeneName	CBX3
Length	183
Function	Seems to be involved in transcriptional silencing in heterochromatin-like complexes. Recognizes and binds histone H3 tails methylated at 'Lys-9', leading to epigenetic repression. May contribute to the association of the heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane through its interaction with lamin B receptor (LBR). Involved in the formation of functional kinetochore through interaction with MIS12 complex proteins. Contributes to the conversion of local chromatin to a heterochromatin-like repressive state through H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation, mediates the recruitment of the methyltransferases SUV39H1 and/or SUV39H2 by the PER complex to the E-box elements of the circadian target genes such as PER2 itself or PER1. Mediates the recruitment of NIPBL to sites of DNA damage at double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:28167679).
