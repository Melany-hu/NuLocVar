EntryName	ZN764_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein 764
GeneName	ZNF764
Length	408
Function	Zinc finger protein that functions as a cofactor for steroid hormone receptors, such as NR3C1/GR (PubMed:28139699). Directs NR3C1/GR transcriptional activity toward specific biologic pathways by changing NR3C1/GR binding and transcriptional activity on the glucocorticoid-responsive genes (PubMed:28139699).
