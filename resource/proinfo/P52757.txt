EntryName	CHIO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-chimaerin (Beta-chimerin) (Rho GTPase-activating protein 3)
GeneName	CHN2 ARHGAP3 BCH
Length	468
Function	GTPase-activating protein for p21-rac. Insufficient expression of beta-2 chimaerin is expected to lead to higher Rac activity and could therefore play a role in the progression from low-grade to high-grade tumors.
