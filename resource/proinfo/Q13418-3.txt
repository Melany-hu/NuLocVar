EntryName	ILK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Scaffold protein ILK (ILK-1) (ILK-2) (Inactive integrin-linked kinase) (p59ILK)
GeneName	ILK ILK1 ILK2
Length	318
Function	Scaffold protein which mediates protein-protein interactions during a range of cellular events including focal adhesion assembly, cell adhesion and cell migration (PubMed:17420447, PubMed:20005845, PubMed:30367047, PubMed:32528174). Regulates integrin-mediated signal transduction by contributing to inside-out integrin activation (By similarity). Recruits PARVA and LIMS1/PITCH to form the heterotrimeric IPP (ILK-PINCH-PARVIN) complex which binds to F-actin via the C-terminal tail of LIMS1 and the N-terminal region of PARVA, promoting F-actin filament bundling, a process required to generate force for actin cytoskeleton reorganization and subsequent dynamic cell adhesion events such as cell spreading and migration (PubMed:30367047). Binding to PARVA promotes effective assembly of ILK into focal adhesions while PARVA-bound ILK can simultaneously engage integrin-beta cytoplasmic tails to mediate cell adhesion (PubMed:20005845). Plays a role with PARVG in promoting the cell adhesion and spreading of leukocytes (PubMed:16517730). Acts as an upstream effector of both AKT1/PKB and GSK3 (PubMed:9736715). Mediates trafficking of caveolae to the cell surface in an ITGB1-dependent manner by promoting the recruitment of IQGAP1 to the cell cortex which cooperates with its effector DIAPH1 to locally stabilize microtubules and allow stable insertion of caveolae into the plasma membrane (By similarity). Required for the maintenance of mitotic spindle integrity by promoting phosphorylation of TACC3 by AURKA (PubMed:18283114). Associates with chromatin and may act as a negative regulator of transcription when located in the nucleus (PubMed:17420447).
