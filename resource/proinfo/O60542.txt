UniprotID	O60542
Accession	O60542
EntryName	PSPN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Persephin (PSP)
GeneName	PSPN
Length	156
Function	Growth factor that exhibits neurotrophic activity on mesencephalic dopaminergic and motor neurons (PubMed:11116144, PubMed:9491986). Acts by binding to its coreceptor, GFRA4, leading to autophosphorylation and activation of the RET receptor (PubMed:11116144).
