UniprotID	Q6ZMB0
Accession	Q6ZMB0;E9PKS1;Q6ZSC5;Q8TAZ4;Q8TDX1
EntryName	B3GN6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acetylgalactosaminyl-O-glycosyl-glycoprotein beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.147) (Core 3 synthase) (UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 6) (BGnT-6) (Beta-1,3-Gn-T6) (Beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 6) (Beta3Gn-T6)
GeneName	B3GNT6
Length	384
Function	Beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that synthesizes the core 3 structure of the O-glycan, an important precursor in the biosynthesis of mucin-type glycoproteins. Plays an important role in the synthesis of mucin-type O-glycans in digestive organs.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
