UniprotID	Q99788
Accession	Q99788;A8K6Y5;O75748;Q3KP37;Q5U0H0;Q99789
EntryName	CML1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chemerin-like receptor 1 (Chemokine-like receptor 1) (G-protein coupled receptor ChemR23) (G-protein coupled receptor DEZ)
GeneName	CMKLR1 CHEMR23 DEZ
Length	373
Function	Receptor for the chemoattractant adipokine chemerin/RARRES2 and for the omega-3 fatty acid derived molecule resolvin E1. Interaction with RARRES2 initiates activation of G proteins G(i)/G(o) and beta-arrestin pathways inducing cellular responses via second messenger pathways such as intracellular calcium mobilization, phosphorylation of MAP kinases MAPK1/MAPK3 (ERK1/2), TYRO3, MAPK14/P38MAPK and PI3K leading to multifunctional effects, like reduction of immune responses, enhancing of adipogenesis and angionesis (PubMed:27716822). Resolvin E1 down-regulates cytokine production in macrophages by reducing the activation of MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and NF-kappa-B. Positively regulates adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism.
