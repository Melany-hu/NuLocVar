UniprotID	Q15691
Accession	Q15691;B2R6I7;E1P5M8;Q3KQS8
EntryName	MARE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 1 (APC-binding protein EB1) (End-binding protein 1) (EB1)
GeneName	MAPRE1
Length	268
Function	Plus-end tracking protein (+TIP) that binds to the plus-end of microtubules and regulates the dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton (PubMed:12388762, PubMed:16109370, PubMed:19632184, PubMed:21646404, PubMed:23001180, PubMed:28726242, PubMed:28814570, PubMed:34608293). Recruits other +TIP proteins to microtubules by binding to a conserved Ser-X-Leu-Pro (SXLP) motif in their polypeptide chains (PubMed:19632184, PubMed:36592928). Promotes cytoplasmic microtubule nucleation and elongation (PubMed:12388762, PubMed:16109370, PubMed:19632184, PubMed:21646404, PubMed:28726242, PubMed:28814570). Involved in mitotic spindle positioning by stabilizing microtubules and promoting dynamic connection between astral microtubules and the cortex during mitotic chromosome segregation (PubMed:12388762, PubMed:34608293). Assists chromosome alignment in metaphase by recruiting the SKA complex to the spindle and stabilizing its interactions with microtubule bundles (K-fibers) (PubMed:27225956, PubMed:36592928). Also acts as a regulator of minus-end microtubule organization: interacts with the complex formed by AKAP9 and PDE4DIP, leading to recruit CAMSAP2 to the Golgi apparatus, thereby tethering non-centrosomal minus-end microtubules to the Golgi, an important step for polarized cell movement (PubMed:28814570). Promotes elongation of CAMSAP2-decorated microtubule stretches on the minus-end of microtubules (PubMed:28814570). Acts as a regulator of autophagosome transport via interaction with CAMSAP2 (PubMed:28726242). Functions downstream of Rho GTPases and DIAPH1 in stable microtubule formation (By similarity). May play a role in cell migration (By similarity).
