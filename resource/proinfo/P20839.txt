EntryName	IMDH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMP dehydrogenase 1) (IMPD 1) (IMPDH 1) (EC 1.1.1.205) (IMPDH-I)
GeneName	IMPDH1 IMPD1
Length	514
Function	Catalyzes the conversion of inosine 5'-phosphate (IMP) to xanthosine 5'-phosphate (XMP), the first committed and rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, and therefore plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth. Could also have a single-stranded nucleic acid-binding activity and could play a role in RNA and/or DNA metabolism. It may also have a role in the development of malignancy and the growth progression of some tumors.
