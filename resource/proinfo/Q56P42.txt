UniprotID	Q56P42
Accession	Q56P42
EntryName	PYDC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pyrin domain-containing protein 2 (Pyrin-only protein 2) (cellular POP2) (cPOP2)
GeneName	PYDC2 POP2
Length	97
Function	May play a role in innate immunity by disrupting the interaction between PYCARD and NLRP3, thereby regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome (PubMed:17178784, PubMed:17339483). May also inhibit NF-kappa-B signaling distally by affecting the nuclear accumulation of RELA (PubMed:17339483, PubMed:24871464).
