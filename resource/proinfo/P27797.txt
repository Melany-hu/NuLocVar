EntryName	CALR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calreticulin (CRP55) (Calregulin) (Endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 60) (ERp60) (HACBP) (grp60)
GeneName	CALR CRTC
Length	417
Function	Calcium-binding chaperone that promotes folding, oligomeric assembly and quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the calreticulin/calnexin cycle. This lectin interacts transiently with almost all of the monoglucosylated glycoproteins that are synthesized in the ER (PubMed:7876246). Interacts with the DNA-binding domain of NR3C1 and mediates its nuclear export (PubMed:11149926). Involved in maternal gene expression regulation. May participate in oocyte maturation via the regulation of calcium homeostasis (By similarity). Present in the cortical granules of non-activated oocytes, is exocytosed during the cortical reaction in response to oocyte activation and might participate in the block to polyspermy (By similarity).
