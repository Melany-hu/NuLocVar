EntryName	GNA13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-13 (G alpha-13) (G-protein subunit alpha-13)
GeneName	GNA13
Length	377
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as modulators or transducers in various transmembrane signaling systems (PubMed:15240885, PubMed:16705036, PubMed:16787920, PubMed:27084452). Activates effector molecule RhoA by binding and activating RhoGEFs (ARHGEF1/p115RhoGEF, ARHGEF11/PDZ-RhoGEF and ARHGEF12/LARG) (PubMed:12515866, PubMed:15240885). GNA13-dependent Rho signaling subsequently regulates transcription factor AP-1 (activating protein-1) (By similarity). Promotes tumor cell invasion and metastasis by activating RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway (PubMed:16705036, PubMed:16787920, PubMed:27084452). Inhibits CDH1-mediated cell adhesion in a process independent from Rho activation (PubMed:11976333). In lymphoid follicles, transmits P2RY8- and S1PR2-dependent signals that lead to inhibition of germinal center (GC) B cell growth and migration outside the GC niche.
