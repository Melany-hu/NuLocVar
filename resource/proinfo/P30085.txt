UniprotID	P30085
Accession	P30085;B2R6S5;B4DPU7;E9PGI8;Q53GB7;Q5SVZ0;Q96C07;Q9UBQ8;Q9UIA2
EntryName	KCY_HUMAN
ProteinName	UMP-CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14) (Deoxycytidylate kinase) (CK) (dCMP kinase) (Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase) (EC 2.7.4.6) (Uridine monophosphate/cytidine monophosphate kinase) (UMP/CMP kinase) (UMP/CMPK)
GeneName	CMPK1 CMK CMPK UCK UMK UMPK
Length	196
Function	Catalyzes the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside monophosphates at the expense of ATP. Plays an important role in de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. Has preference for UMP and CMP as phosphate acceptors. Also displays broad nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm
