UniprotID	Q6PF06
Accession	Q6PF06;B7Z216;B7Z3D3;Q05DJ4;Q5QP83;Q8NAG2;Q96N36
EntryName	TM10B_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA methyltransferase 10 homolog B (EC 2.1.1.221) (RNA (guanine-9-)-methyltransferase domain-containing protein 3) (tRNA (guanine(9)-N(1))-methyltransferase TRMT10B)
GeneName	TRMT10B RG9MTD3
Length	316
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent guanine N(1)-methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of N(1)-methylguanine at position 9 (m1G9) in tRNAs (PubMed:23042678). Probably not able to catalyze formation of N(1)-methyladenine at position 9 (m1A9) in tRNAs (PubMed:23042678).
