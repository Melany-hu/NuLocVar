EntryName	ACHA5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-5
GeneName	CHRNA5 NACHRA5
Length	468
Function	Component of neuronal acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that function as pentameric, ligand-gated cation channels with high calcium permeability among other activities. nAChRs are excitatory neurotrasnmitter receptors formed by a collection of nAChR subunits known to mediate synaptic transmission in the nervous system and the neuromuscular junction. Each nAchR subunit confers differential attributes to channel properties, including activation, deactivation and desensitization kinetics, pH sensitivity, cation permeability, and binding to allosteric modulators (PubMed:20881005, PubMed:8663494). Has an accessory rather than functional role and is only able to form functional nAChRs when co-assembled with another beta subunit (PubMed:20881005, PubMed:8663494). Participates in pentameric assemblies along with CHRNA3, CHRNA4, CHRNB2 and CHRNB4 (PubMed:20881005, PubMed:8663494). Increases receptor sensitivity to acetylcholine and nicotine when associated with CHRNA4 and CHRNB2 (PubMed:8663494). Plays a role in nicotine addiction (PubMed:20881005).
