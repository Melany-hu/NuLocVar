UniprotID	P16403
Accession	P16403;A8K4I2
EntryName	H12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H1.2 (Histone H1c) (Histone H1d) (Histone H1s-1)
GeneName	H1-2 H1F2 HIST1H1C
Length	213
Function	Histone H1 protein binds to linker DNA between nucleosomes forming the macromolecular structure known as the chromatin fiber. Histones H1 are necessary for the condensation of nucleosome chains into higher-order structured fibers. Also acts as a regulator of individual gene transcription through chromatin remodeling, nucleosome spacing and DNA methylation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
