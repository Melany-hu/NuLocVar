UniprotID	O75306
Accession	O75306;D3DVG7;J3KPM7;Q5VTW0;Q969P3;Q9UEV3
EntryName	NDUS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 2, mitochondrial (EC 7.1.1.2) (Complex I-49kD) (CI-49kD) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 49 kDa subunit)
GeneName	NDUFS2
Length	463
Function	Core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) which catalyzes electron transfer from NADH through the respiratory chain, using ubiquinone as an electron acceptor (PubMed:22036843, PubMed:28031252, PubMed:30922174). Essential for the catalytic activity of complex I (PubMed:22036843, PubMed:30922174). Essential for the assembly of complex I (By similarity). Redox-sensitive, critical component of the oxygen-sensing pathway in the pulmonary vasculature which plays a key role in acute pulmonary oxygen-sensing and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (PubMed:30922174). Plays an important role in carotid body sensing of hypoxia (By similarity). Essential for glia-like neural stem and progenitor cell proliferation, differentiation and subsequent oligodendrocyte or neuronal maturation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
