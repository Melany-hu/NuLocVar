UniprotID	Q14699
Accession	Q14699;Q0D2G0;Q496Y2;Q4QQI7;Q5JB48;Q7Z7P2
EntryName	RFTN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Raftlin (Cell migration-inducing gene 2 protein) (Raft-linking protein)
GeneName	RFTN1 KIAA0084 MIG2
Length	578
Function	Involved in protein trafficking via association with clathrin and AP2 complex (PubMed:21266579, PubMed:27022195). Upon bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulation, mediates internalization of TLR4 to endosomes in dendritic cells and macrophages; and internalization of poly(I:C) to TLR3-positive endosomes in myeloid dendritic cells and epithelial cells; resulting in activation of TICAM1-mediated signaling and subsequent IFNB1 production (PubMed:21266579, PubMed:27022195). Involved in T-cell antigen receptor-mediated signaling by regulating tyrosine kinase LCK localization, T-cell dependent antibody production and cytokine secretion (By similarity). May regulate B-cell antigen receptor-mediated signaling (PubMed:12805216). May play a pivotal role in the formation and/or maintenance of lipid rafts (PubMed:12805216).
