UniprotID	P57057
Accession	P57057;D3DSJ7;Q9HAQ1
EntryName	G6PT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucose-6-phosphate exchanger SLC37A1 (Glycerol-3-phosphate permease) (G-3-P permease) (Solute carrier family 37 member 1)
GeneName	SLC37A1 G3PP
Length	533
Function	Inorganic phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate antiporter. May transport cytoplasmic glucose-6-phosphate into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and translocate inorganic phosphate into the opposite direction. Independent of a lumenal glucose-6-phosphatase. May not play a role in homeostatic regulation of blood glucose levels.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
