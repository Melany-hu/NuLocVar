UniprotID	P22310
Accession	P22310;B2R937;B8K288;Q5DT00
EntryName	UD14_HUMAN
ProteinName	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A4 (UGT1A4) (EC 2.4.1.17) (Bilirubin-specific UDPGT isozyme 2) (hUG-BR2) (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-4) (UDPGT 1-4) (UGT1*4) (UGT1-04) (UGT1.4) (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-D) (UGT-1D) (UGT1D)
GeneName	UGT1A4 GNT1 UGT1
Length	534
Function	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) that catalyzes phase II biotransformation reactions in which lipophilic substrates are conjugated with glucuronic acid to increase the metabolite's water solubility, thereby facilitating excretion into either the urine or bile (PubMed:18177842, PubMed:24641623, PubMed:15231852). Essential for the elimination and detoxification of drugs, xenobiotics and endogenous compounds (PubMed:18177842). Involved in the glucuronidation of calcidiol, which is the major circulating form of vitamin D3 essential for the regulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis (PubMed:24641623). Also glucuronidates the biologically active form of vitamin D3, calcitriol, probably leading to its biliary transport and intestinal reabsorption (PubMed:18177842). Involved in the glucuronidation of arachidonic acid (AA) and AA-derived eicosanoids including 15-HETE, 20-HETE and PGB1 (PubMed:15231852).
