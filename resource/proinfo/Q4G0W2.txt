UniprotID	Q4G0W2
Accession	Q4G0W2
EntryName	DUS28_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity phosphatase 28 (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.48)
GeneName	DUSP28
Length	176
Function	Has phosphatase activity with the synthetic substrate 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (in vitro) (PubMed:24531476, PubMed:29121083). Has almost no detectable activity with phosphotyrosine, even less activity with phosphothreonine and displays complete lack of activity with phosphoserine (PubMed:29121083). The poor activity with phosphotyrosine may be due to steric hindrance by bulky amino acid sidechains that obstruct access to the active site (PubMed:29121083).
