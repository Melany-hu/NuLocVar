UniprotID	O95379
Accession	O95379;B3KMH1;B3KMI2;B7Z713;Q9P1Q1;Q9UER5;Q9UP47
EntryName	TFIP8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8 (TNF alpha-induced protein 8) (Head and neck tumor and metastasis-related protein) (MDC-3.13) (NF-kappa-B-inducible DED-containing protein) (NDED) (SCC-S2) (TNF-induced protein GG2-1)
GeneName	TNFAIP8
Length	198
Function	Acts as a negative mediator of apoptosis and may play a role in tumor progression. Suppresses the TNF-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-8 activity but not the processing of procaspase-8, subsequently resulting in inhibition of BID cleavage and caspase-3 activation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
