UniprotID	Q01081
Accession	Q01081;Q701P4;Q71RF1
EntryName	U2AF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Splicing factor U2AF 35 kDa subunit (U2 auxiliary factor 35 kDa subunit) (U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1) (U2 snRNP auxiliary factor small subunit)
GeneName	U2AF1 U2AF35 U2AFBP FP793
Length	240
Function	Plays a critical role in both constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions and protein-RNA interactions required for accurate 3'-splice site selection. Recruits U2 snRNP to the branch point. Directly mediates interactions between U2AF2 and proteins bound to the enhancers and thus may function as a bridge between U2AF2 and the enhancer complex to recruit it to the adjacent intron.
