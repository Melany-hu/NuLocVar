UniprotID	A8MTY7
Accession	A8MTY7
EntryName	KRA97_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 9-7 (Keratin-associated protein 9-like 1)
GeneName	KRTAP9-7 KAP9.7 KRTAP9.7 KRTAP9L1
Length	169
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins (By similarity).
