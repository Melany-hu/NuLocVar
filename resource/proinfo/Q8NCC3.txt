EntryName	PAG15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysosomal phospholipase A and acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.-) (EC 3.1.1.32) (EC 3.1.1.4) (1-O-acylceramide synthase) (ACS) (LCAT-like lysophospholipase) (LLPL) (EC 3.1.1.5) (Lysophospholipase 3) (Lysosomal phospholipase A2) (LPLA2) (Phospholipase A2 group XV) (PLA2G15)
GeneName	PLA2G15 LYPLA3 UNQ341/PRO540
Length	412
Function	Has dual calcium-independent phospholipase and O-acyltransferase activities with a potential role in glycerophospholipid homeostasis and remodeling of acyl groups of lipophilic alcohols present in acidic cellular compartments (PubMed:10092508, PubMed:11790796, PubMed:20410020, PubMed:23958596, PubMed:25727495, PubMed:29724779). Catalyzes hydrolysis of the ester bond of the fatty acyl group attached at sn-1 or sn-2 position of phospholipids (phospholipase A1 or A2 activity) and transfer it to the hydroxyl group at the first carbon of lipophilic alcohols (O-acyltransferase activity) (PubMed:10092508, PubMed:11790796, PubMed:20410020, PubMed:23958596, PubMed:25727495, PubMed:29724779, PubMed:36823305). Among preferred fatty acyl donors are phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylglycerols and phosphatidylserines (PubMed:29724779, PubMed:36823305). Favors sn-2 over sn-1 deacylation of unsaturated fatty acyl groups of phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and phosphatidylglycerols (PubMed:36823305). Among preferred fatty acyl acceptors are natural lipophilic alcohols including short-chain ceramide N-acetyl-sphingosine (C2 ceramide), alkylacylglycerols, monoacylglycerols, and acylethanolamides such as anandamide and oleoylethanolamide (PubMed:29724779). Selectively hydrolyzes the sn-1 fatty acyl group of truncated oxidized phospholipids and may play a role in detoxification of reactive oxidized phospholipids during oxidative stress (PubMed:30830753). Required for normal phospholipid degradation in alveolar macrophages with potential implications in the clearance of pulmonary surfactant, which is mainly composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) (By similarity). Involved in the first step of bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) de novo synthesis from phosphatidylglycerol (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-sn-glycerol), PG) (PubMed:36823305). BMP is an important player in cargo sorting and degradation, regulation of cellular cholesterol levels and intercellular communication (PubMed:36823305). At neutral pH, hydrolyzes the sn-1 fatty acyl group of the lysophosphatidylcholines (PubMed:10092508).
