UniprotID	Q9BYS1
Accession	Q9BYS1;A6NJW6;A6NLZ6;B6ZDR1;Q52LP6
EntryName	KRA15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 1-5 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 1.5) (Keratin-associated protein 1.5)
GeneName	KRTAP1-5 KAP1.5 KRTAP1.5
Length	174
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
