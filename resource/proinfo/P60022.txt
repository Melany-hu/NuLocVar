UniprotID	P60022
Accession	P60022;Q09753
EntryName	DEFB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-defensin 1 (BD-1) (hBD-1) (Defensin, beta 1)
GeneName	DEFB1 BD1 HBD1
Length	68
Function	Has bactericidal activity. May act as a ligand for C-C chemokine receptor CCR6. Positively regulates the sperm motility and bactericidal activity in a CCR6-dependent manner. Binds to CCR6 and triggers Ca2+ mobilization in the sperm which is important for its motility (PubMed:25122636).
