UniprotID	Q8IYX1
Accession	Q8IYX1;B9A6M2
EntryName	TBC21_HUMAN
ProteinName	TBC1 domain family member 21 (Male germ cell Rab GTPase-activating protein)
GeneName	TBC1D21 MGCRABGAP
Length	336
Function	Acts as a GTPase-activating protein for Rab family protein(s) (PubMed:19077034, PubMed:28067790). Essential for the establishment of male fertility, and is required for both the production of normal sperm number and sperm function (By similarity). Plays an important role in the formation of intact mitochondria, outer dense fibers and axoneme within the sperm tail (By similarity). Essential for sperm mitochondrial sheath formation and for the interactions of ARMC12 with VDAC2 and VDAC3 (By similarity). May be involved in acrosome formation and cytoskeletal reorganization during spermiogenesis, possibly by regulating RAB3A activity (PubMed:21128978).
