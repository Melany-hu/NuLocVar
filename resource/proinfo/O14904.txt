UniprotID	O14904
Accession	O14904;A6NLW2;Q2M2J3;Q5VWU0;Q96S50
EntryName	WNT9A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Wnt-9a (Protein Wnt-14)
GeneName	WNT9A WNT14
Length	365
Function	Ligand for members of the frizzled family of seven transmembrane receptors. Functions in the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Required for normal timing of IHH expression during embryonic bone development, normal chondrocyte maturation and for normal bone mineralization during embryonic bone development. Plays a redundant role in maintaining joint integrity.
