UniprotID	P06746
Accession	P06746;B2RC78;Q3KP48;Q6FI34
EntryName	DPOLB_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA polymerase beta (EC 2.7.7.7) (5'-deoxyribose-phosphate lyase) (5'-dRP lyase) (EC 4.2.99.-) (AP lyase) (EC 4.2.99.18)
GeneName	POLB
Length	335
Function	Repair polymerase that plays a key role in base-excision repair (PubMed:10556592, PubMed:9207062, PubMed:9572863). During this process, the damaged base is excised by specific DNA glycosylases, the DNA backbone is nicked at the abasic site by an apurinic/apyrimidic (AP) endonuclease, and POLB removes 5'-deoxyribose-phosphate from the preincised AP site acting as a 5'-deoxyribose-phosphate lyase (5'-dRP lyase); through its DNA polymerase activity, it adds one nucleotide to the 3' end of the arising single-nucleotide gap (PubMed:10556592, PubMed:17526740, PubMed:9556598, PubMed:9572863, PubMed:9614142). Conducts 'gap-filling' DNA synthesis in a stepwise distributive fashion rather than in a processive fashion as for other DNA polymerases. It is also able to cleave sugar-phosphate bonds 3' to an intact AP site, acting as an AP lyase (PubMed:9614142).
