EntryName	MEIS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein Meis2 (Meis1-related protein 1)
GeneName	MEIS2 MRG1
Length	477
Function	Involved in transcriptional regulation. Binds to HOX or PBX proteins to form dimers, or to a DNA-bound dimer of PBX and HOX proteins and thought to have a role in stabilization of the homeoprotein-DNA complex. Isoform 3 is required for the activity of a PDX1:PBX1b:MEIS2b complex in pancreatic acinar cells involved in the transcriptional activation of the ELA1 enhancer; the complex binds to the enhancer B element and cooperates with the transcription factor 1 complex (PTF1) bound to the enhancer A element; MEIS2 is not involved in complex DNA-binding. Probably in complex with PBX1, is involved in transcriptional regulation by KLF4. Isoform 3 and isoform 4 can bind to a EPHA8 promoter sequence containing the DNA motif 5'-CGGTCA-3'; in cooperation with a PBX protein (such as PBX2) is proposed to be involved in the transcriptional activation of EPHA8 in the developing midbrain. May be involved in regulation of myeloid differentiation. Can bind to the DNA sequence 5'-TGACAG-3'in the activator ACT sequence of the D(1A) dopamine receptor (DRD1) promoter and activate DRD1 transcription; isoform 5 cannot activate DRD1 transcription.
