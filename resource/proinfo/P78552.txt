UniprotID	P78552
Accession	P78552;O95646;Q5JSL4;Q99656;Q9UDY5
EntryName	I13R1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-13 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL-13 receptor subunit alpha-1) (IL-13R subunit alpha-1) (IL-13R-alpha-1) (IL-13RA1) (Cancer/testis antigen 19) (CT19) (CD antigen CD213a1)
GeneName	IL13RA1 IL13R IL13RA
Length	427
Function	Binds with low affinity to interleukin-13 (IL13). Together with IL4RA can form a functional receptor for IL13. Also serves as an alternate accessory protein to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain for interleukin-4 (IL4) signaling, but cannot replace the function of IL2RG in allowing enhanced interleukin-2 (IL2) binding activity.
