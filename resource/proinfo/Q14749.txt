UniprotID	Q14749
Accession	Q14749;Q5T8W2;Q9NNZ1;Q9NS24
EntryName	GNMT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.20)
GeneName	GNMT
Length	295
Function	Catalyzes the methylation of glycine by using S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to form N-methylglycine (sarcosine) with the concomitant production of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), a reaction regulated by the binding of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Plays an important role in the regulation of methyl group metabolism by regulating the ratio between S-adenosyl-L-methionine and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine.
