UniprotID	Q13362
Accession	Q13362;B4DYJ8;B5BUA5;F5GWP3;Q14391;Q15060;Q15174;Q6ZN33
EntryName	2A5G_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A 56 kDa regulatory subunit gamma isoform (PP2A B subunit isoform B'-gamma) (PP2A B subunit isoform B56-gamma) (PP2A B subunit isoform PR61-gamma) (PP2A B subunit isoform R5-gamma) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-29)
GeneName	PPP2R5C KIAA0044
Length	524
Function	The B regulatory subunit might modulate substrate selectivity and catalytic activity, and also might direct the localization of the catalytic enzyme to a particular subcellular compartment. The PP2A-PPP2R5C holoenzyme may specifically dephosphorylate and activate TP53 and play a role in DNA damage-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. PP2A-PPP2R5C may also regulate the ERK signaling pathway through ERK dephosphorylation.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome; Centromere
