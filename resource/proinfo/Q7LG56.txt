EntryName	RIR2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase subunit M2 B (EC 1.17.4.1) (TP53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase M2 B) (p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase small subunit 2-like protein) (p53R2)
GeneName	RRM2B P53R2
Length	351
Function	Plays a pivotal role in cell survival by repairing damaged DNA in a p53/TP53-dependent manner. Supplies deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair in cells arrested at G1 or G2. Contains an iron-tyrosyl free radical center required for catalysis. Forms an active ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) complex with RRM1 which is expressed both in resting and proliferating cells in response to DNA damage.
