UniprotID	Q6J9G0
Accession	Q6J9G0;B2R9T2;Q52LR3;Q9BXY2;Q9NSH1
EntryName	STYK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tyrosine-protein kinase STYK1 (EC 2.7.10.2) (Novel oncogene with kinase domain) (Protein PK-unique) (Serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase 1)
GeneName	STYK1 NOK
Length	422
Function	Probable tyrosine protein-kinase, which has strong transforming capabilities on a variety of cell lines. When overexpressed, it can also induce tumor cell invasion as well as metastasis in distant organs. May act by activating both MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinases (PI3K) pathways (By similarity).
