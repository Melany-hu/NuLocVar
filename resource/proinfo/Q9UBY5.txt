UniprotID	Q9UBY5
Accession	Q9UBY5;A0AVA3
EntryName	LPAR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (LPA receptor 3) (LPA-3) (Lysophosphatidic acid receptor Edg-7)
GeneName	LPAR3 EDG7 LPA3
Length	353
Function	Receptor for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a mediator of diverse cellular activities. May play a role in the development of ovarian cancer. Seems to be coupled to the G(i)/G(o) and G(q) families of heteromeric G proteins.
