Accession	P55061;B2R5M4;F8W034;O14938;Q643A7;Q96J50
EntryName	BI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bax inhibitor 1 (BI-1) (Testis-enhanced gene transcript protein) (Transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif-containing protein 6)
GeneName	TMBIM6 BI1 TEGT
Length	237
Function	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein that confers cellular protection as an anti-apoptotic protein by limiting multiple stress-inducing pathways surrounding the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (PubMed:21075086, PubMed:21068390). Inhibits the activities of the key sensor for the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response IRE1alpha/ERN1 both directly and by blocking BAX/BAK binding (PubMed:19328063). Modulates ER calcium homeostasis by acting as a calcium-leak channel (PubMed:22128171). Negatively regulates autophagy and autophagosome formation, especially during periods of nutrient deprivation, and reduces cell survival during starvation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
