UniprotID	Q8NC69
Accession	Q8NC69;B3KNI5;Q8NBS6;Q8TCA6
EntryName	KCTD6_HUMAN
ProteinName	BTB/POZ domain-containing protein KCTD6 (KCASH3 protein) (Potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 6)
GeneName	KCTD6
Length	237
Function	Probable substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex mediating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Promotes the ubiquitination of HDAC1; the function seems to depend on KCTD11:KCTD6 oligomerization. Can function as antagonist of the Hedgehog pathway by affecting the nuclear transfer of transcription factor GLI1; the function probably occurs via HDAC1 down-regulation, keeping GLI1 acetylated and inactive. Inhibits cell growth and tumorigenicity of medulloblastoma (MDB) (PubMed:21472142). Involved in regulating protein levels of ANK1 isoform Mu17 probably implicating CUL3-dependent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:22573887).
