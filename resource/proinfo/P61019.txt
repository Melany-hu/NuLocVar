UniprotID	P61019
Accession	P61019;B2R5W8;B4DMQ5;P08886
EntryName	RAB2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-2A (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB2A RAB2
Length	212
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states. In their active state, drive transport of vesicular carriers from donor organelles to acceptor organelles to regulate the membrane traffic that maintains organelle identity and morphology (By similarity). Required for protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Regulates the compacted morphology of the Golgi (Probable). Together with RAB2B, redundantly required for efficient autophagic flux (PubMed:28483915).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane; Melanosome; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Acrosome; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome membrane
