UniprotID	Q9H2W2
Accession	Q9H2W2;B7ZLF9
EntryName	MIXL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein MIXL1 (Homeodomain protein MIX) (hMix) (MIX1 homeobox-like protein 1) (Mix.1 homeobox-like protein)
GeneName	MIXL1 MIXL
Length	232
Function	Transcription factor that play a central role in proper axial mesendoderm morphogenesis and endoderm formation. Required for efficient differentiation of cells from the primitive streak stage to blood, by acting early in the recruitment and/or expansion of mesodermal progenitors to the hemangioblastic and hematopoietic lineages. Also involved in the morphogenesis of the heart and the gut during embryogenesis. Acts as a negative regulator of brachyury expression (By similarity).
