EntryName	UB2D2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D2 (EC 2.3.2.23) ((E3-independent) E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme D2) (EC 2.3.2.24) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme D2) (Ubiquitin carrier protein D2) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2(17)KB 2) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-17 kDa 2) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase D2) (p53-regulated ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 1)
GeneName	UBE2D2 PUBC1 UBC4 UBC5B UBCH4 UBCH5B
Length	147
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins (PubMed:10329681, PubMed:18042044, PubMed:18703417, PubMed:20061386, PubMed:20403326, PubMed:20525694, PubMed:26475854, PubMed:28322253). Catalyzes 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:10329681, PubMed:18042044, PubMed:18359941, PubMed:18703417, PubMed:20061386, PubMed:20403326, PubMed:20525694, PubMed:26475854). Mediates the selective degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins (PubMed:10329681, PubMed:18042044, PubMed:18359941, PubMed:18703417, PubMed:20061386, PubMed:20403326, PubMed:20525694, PubMed:26475854). Functions in the E6/E6-AP-induced ubiquitination of p53/TP53 (PubMed:15280377). Mediates ubiquitination of PEX5 and SQSTM1 and autoubiquitination of STUB1 and TRAF6 (PubMed:18359941, PubMed:28322253). Involved in the signal-induced conjugation and subsequent degradation of NFKBIA, FBXW2-mediated GCM1 ubiquitination and degradation, MDM2-dependent degradation of p53/TP53 and the activation of MAVS in the mitochondria by RIGI in response to viral infection (PubMed:18703417, PubMed:20403326). Essential for viral activation of IRF3 (PubMed:19854139).
