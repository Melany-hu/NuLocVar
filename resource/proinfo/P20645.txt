UniprotID	P20645
Accession	P20645;A8K528;D3DUV5
EntryName	MPRD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CD Man-6-P receptor) (CD-MPR) (46 kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor) (MPR 46)
GeneName	M6PR MPR46 MPRD
Length	277
Function	Transport of phosphorylated lysosomal enzymes from the Golgi complex and the cell surface to lysosomes. Lysosomal enzymes bearing phosphomannosyl residues bind specifically to mannose-6-phosphate receptors in the Golgi apparatus and the resulting receptor-ligand complex is transported to an acidic prelyosomal compartment where the low pH mediates the dissociation of the complex.
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane
