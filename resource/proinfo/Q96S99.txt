UniprotID	Q96S99
Accession	Q96S99;Q96K11;Q9BUB9
EntryName	PKHF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family F member 1 (PH domain-containing family F member 1) (Lysosome-associated apoptosis-inducing protein containing PH and FYVE domains) (Apoptosis-inducing protein) (PH and FYVE domain-containing protein 1) (Phafin-1) (Zinc finger FYVE domain-containing protein 15)
GeneName	PLEKHF1 APPD LAPF ZFYVE15
Length	279
Function	May induce apoptosis through the lysosomal-mitochondrial pathway. Translocates to the lysosome initiating the permeabilization of lysosomal membrane (LMP) and resulting in the release of CTSD and CTSL to the cytoplasm. Triggers the caspase-independent apoptosis by altering mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) resulting in the release of PDCD8.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region; Lysosome
