ProteinName	Vimentin
GeneName	VIM
Length	466
Function	Vimentins are class-III intermediate filaments found in various non-epithelial cells, especially mesenchymal cells. Vimentin is attached to the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria, either laterally or terminally. Plays a role in cell directional movement, orientation, cell sheet organization and Golgi complex polarization at the cell migration front (By similarity). Protects SCRIB from proteasomal degradation and facilitates its localization to intermediate filaments in a cell contact-mediated manner (By similarity).
