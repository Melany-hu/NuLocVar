UniprotID	Q8N490
Accession	Q8N490;A8K1F2;Q96A48;Q9BU26;Q9NSX4;Q9ULN6;Q9Y4T1
EntryName	PNKD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable thioesterase PNKD (EC 3.1.2.-) (Myofibrillogenesis regulator 1) (MR-1) (Paroxysmal nonkinesiogenic dyskinesia protein) (Trans-activated by hepatitis C virus core protein 2)
GeneName	PNKD KIAA1184 MR1 TAHCCP2 FKSG19 UNQ2491/PRO5778
Length	385
Function	Probable thioesterase that may play a role in cellular detoxification processes; it likely acts on a yet-unknown alpha-hydroxythioester substrate (Probable). In vitro, it is able to catalyze the hydrolysis of S-D-lactoyl-glutathione to form glutathione and D-lactic acid at very low rate, though this reaction is not physiologically relevant in vivo (PubMed:21487022).
