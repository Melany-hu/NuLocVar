UniprotID	P26371
Accession	P26371;Q14564;Q3MIP8
EntryName	KRA59_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 5-9 (Keratin, cuticle, ultrahigh sulfur 1) (Keratin, ultra high-sulfur matrix protein A) (Keratin-associated protein 5.9) (UHS keratin A) (UHS KerA) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 5.9)
GeneName	KRTAP5-9 KAP5.9 KRN1 KRTAP5.9 UHSK1
Length	169
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated protein (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
