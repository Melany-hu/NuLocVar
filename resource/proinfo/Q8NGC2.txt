UniprotID	Q8NGC2
Accession	Q8NGC2;Q6IET6;Q96R62
EntryName	OR4E2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Olfactory receptor 4E2 (Olfactory receptor OR14-42)
GeneName	OR4E2
Length	313
Function	Olfactory receptor that is activated by the binding of organosulfur odorants with thioether groups such as (methylthio)methanethiol (MTMT) and bis(methylthiomethyl) disulfide (By similarity). Also binds odorants cis-cyclooctene and tert-butyl mercaptan (By similarity). The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylyl cyclase (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
