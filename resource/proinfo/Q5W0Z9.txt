EntryName	ZDH20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC20 (EC 2.3.1.225) (Acyltransferase ZDHHC20) (EC 2.3.1.-) (DHHC domain-containing cysteine-rich protein 20) (DHHC20) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 20)
GeneName	ZDHHC20
Length	365
Function	Palmitoyltransferase that could catalyze the addition of palmitate onto various protein substrates (PubMed:27153536, PubMed:29326245, PubMed:33219126). Catalyzes palmitoylation of Cys residues in the cytoplasmic C-terminus of EGFR, and modulates the duration of EGFR signaling by modulating palmitoylation-dependent EGFR internalization and degradation (PubMed:27153536). Has a preference for acyl-CoA with C16 fatty acid chains (PubMed:29326245). Can also utilize acyl-CoA with C14 and C18 fatty acid chains (PubMed:29326245). May palmitoylate CALHM1 subunit of gustatory voltage-gated ion channels and modulate channel gating and kinetics.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane
