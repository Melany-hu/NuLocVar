EntryName	GFRAL_HUMAN
ProteinName	GDNF family receptor alpha-like
GeneName	GFRAL C6orf144 UNQ9356/PRO34128
Length	394
Function	Brainstem-restricted receptor for GDF15 hormone, which triggers an aversive response, characterized by nausea, vomiting, and/or loss of appetite in response to various stresses (PubMed:28846097, PubMed:28846098, PubMed:28846099, PubMed:28953886, PubMed:36630958). The aversive response is both required to reduce continuing exposure to those stresses at the time of exposure and to promote avoidance behavior in the future (PubMed:28846097, PubMed:28846098, PubMed:28846099, PubMed:28953886, PubMed:36630958). The GDF15-GFRAL aversive response is triggered by stresses, such as anticancer drugs (camptothecin or cisplatin), cancers or drugs such as metformin (PubMed:32661391). Upon interaction with its ligand, GDF15, mediates the GDF15-induced autophosphorylation and activation of the RET tyrosine kinase receptor, leading to activation of MAPK- and AKT- signaling pathways (PubMed:31535977, PubMed:32661391). Ligand-binding activates GFRAL-expressing neurons localized in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem (By similarity). The GDF15-GFRAL signal induces expression of genes involved in metabolism, such as lipid metabolism in adipose tissues (PubMed:32661391).
