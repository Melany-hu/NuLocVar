UniprotID	Q9Y639
Accession	Q9Y639;B2RAL7;B7Z4D3;B7ZLL2;Q17R52;Q59EJ9;Q6NVX7;Q9Y640
EntryName	NPTN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuroplastin (Stromal cell-derived receptor 1) (SDR-1)
GeneName	NPTN SDFR1 SDR1
Length	398
Function	Probable homophilic and heterophilic cell adhesion molecule involved in long term potentiation at hippocampal excitatory synapses through activation of p38MAPK. May also regulate neurite outgrowth by activating the FGFR1 signaling pathway. May play a role in synaptic plasticity (By similarity). Also acts as a chaperone for ATP2B1; stabilizes ATP2B1 and increases its ATPase activity (PubMed:30190470). Promotes localization of XKR8 at the cell membrane (PubMed:27503893).
