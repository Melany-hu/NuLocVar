UniprotID	P16989
Accession	P16989;B2RBW6;Q14121;Q969N6;Q96B76
EntryName	YBOX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Y-box-binding protein 3 (Cold shock domain-containing protein A) (DNA-binding protein A) (Single-strand DNA-binding protein NF-GMB)
GeneName	YBX3 CSDA DBPA
Length	372
Function	Binds to the GM-CSF promoter. Seems to act as a repressor. Also binds to full-length mRNA and to short RNA sequences containing the consensus site 5'-UCCAUCA-3'. May have a role in translation repression (By similarity).
