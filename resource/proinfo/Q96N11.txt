EntryName	INT15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Integrator complex subunit 15
GeneName	INTS15 C7orf26
Length	449
Function	Component of the integrator complex, a multiprotein complex that terminates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription in the promoter-proximal region of genes (PubMed:36920904, PubMed:38570683, PubMed:38823386). The integrator complex provides a quality checkpoint during transcription elongation by driving premature transcription termination of transcripts that are unfavorably configured for transcriptional elongation: the complex terminates transcription by (1) catalyzing dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II subunit POLR2A/RPB1 and SUPT5H/SPT5, (2) degrading the exiting nascent RNA transcript via endonuclease activity and (3) promoting the release of Pol II from bound DNA (PubMed:38570683). The integrator complex is also involved in terminating the synthesis of non-coding Pol II transcripts, such as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), telomerase RNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (PubMed:38570683). INTS15 is part of the integrator tail module that acts as a platform for the recruitment of transcription factors at promoters (PubMed:38823386). Within the integrator complex, INTS15 is required to bridge different integrator modules (PubMed:36920904).
