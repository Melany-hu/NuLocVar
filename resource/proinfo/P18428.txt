UniprotID	P18428
Accession	P18428;B2R938;O43438;Q92672;Q9H403;Q9UD66
EntryName	LBP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP)
GeneName	LBP
Length	481
Function	Plays a role in the innate immune response. Binds to the lipid A moiety of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a glycolipid present in the outer membrane of all Gram-negative bacteria (PubMed:24120359, PubMed:7517398). Acts as an affinity enhancer for CD14, facilitating its association with LPS. Promotes the release of cytokines in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (PubMed:24120359, PubMed:7517398).
