UniprotID	P55073
Accession	P55073;G3XAM0;Q8WVN5
EntryName	IOD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thyroxine 5-deiodinase (EC 1.21.99.3) (5DIII) (DIOIII) (Type 3 DI) (Type III iodothyronine deiodinase)
GeneName	DIO3 ITDI3 TXDI3
Length	304
Function	Plays a crucial role in the metabolism of thyroid hormones (TH) and has specific roles in TH activation and inactivation by deiodination. Catalyzes the conversion of T4 (L-thyroxine/3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine) to rT3 (3,3',5'-triiodothyronine) and T3 (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) to T2 (3,3'-diiodothyronine) via inner-ring deiodination.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Endosome membrane
