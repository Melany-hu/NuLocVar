Function	Growth factor that supports the survival of sensory and sympathetic peripheral neurons in culture and also supports the survival of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral mid-brain (PubMed:10583383, PubMed:9883723). Acts by binding to its coreceptor, GFRA3, leading to autophosphorylation and activation of the RET receptor (PubMed:31535977). Strong attractant of gut hematopoietic cells thus promoting the formation Peyer's patch-like structures, a major component of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (By similarity).
