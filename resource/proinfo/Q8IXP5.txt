UniprotID	Q8IXP5
Accession	Q8IXP5;A0A1C7CYV6
EntryName	OCAT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	POU domain class 2-associating factor 2 (Oct coactivator from tuft cells 1) (Protein OCA-T1) (POU class 2 homeobox-associating factor 2)
GeneName	POU2AF2 C11orf53
Length	288
Function	Transcriptional coactivator of POU2F3 (PubMed:35576971, PubMed:36197978). This complex drives the development of tuft cells, a rare chemosensory cells that coordinate immune and neural functions within mucosal epithelial tissues (PubMed:35576971).
