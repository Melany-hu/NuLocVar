UniprotID	Q9GZT3
Accession	Q9GZT3;J3KMY7
EntryName	SLIRP_HUMAN
ProteinName	SRA stem-loop-interacting RNA-binding protein, mitochondrial
GeneName	SLIRP C14orf156 DC23 DC50 PD04872
Length	109
Function	RNA-binding protein that acts as a nuclear receptor corepressor. Probably acts by binding the SRA RNA, and repressing the SRA-mediated nuclear receptor coactivation. Binds the STR7 loop of SRA RNA. Also able to repress glucocorticoid (GR), androgen (AR), thyroid (TR) and VDR-mediated transactivation.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion; Nucleus
