UniprotID	O43572
Accession	O43572;B2R650;Q96AJ7
EntryName	AKA10_HUMAN
ProteinName	A-kinase anchor protein 10, mitochondrial (AKAP-10) (Dual specificity A kinase-anchoring protein 2) (D-AKAP-2) (Protein kinase A-anchoring protein 10) (PRKA10)
GeneName	AKAP10
Length	662
Function	Differentially targeted protein that binds to type I and II regulatory subunits of protein kinase A and anchors them to the mitochondria or the plasma membrane. Although the physiological relevance between PKA and AKAPS with mitochondria is not fully understood, one idea is that BAD, a proapoptotic member, is phosphorylated and inactivated by mitochondria-anchored PKA. It cannot be excluded too that it may facilitate PKA as well as G protein signal transduction, by acting as an adapter for assembling multiprotein complexes. With its RGS domain, it could lead to the interaction to G-alpha proteins, providing a link between the signaling machinery and the downstream kinase (By similarity).
