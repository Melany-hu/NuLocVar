UniprotID	Q06323
Accession	Q06323;A6NJG9;H0YNE3;Q6IBM2;Q9UEF4
EntryName	PSME1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteasome activator complex subunit 1 (11S regulator complex subunit alpha) (REG-alpha) (Activator of multicatalytic protease subunit 1) (Interferon gamma up-regulated I-5111 protein) (IGUP I-5111) (Proteasome activator 28 subunit alpha) (PA28a) (PA28alpha)
GeneName	PSME1 IFI5111
Length	249
Function	Implicated in immunoproteasome assembly and required for efficient antigen processing. The PA28 activator complex enhances the generation of class I binding peptides by altering the cleavage pattern of the proteasome.
