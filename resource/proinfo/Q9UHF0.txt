EntryName	TKNK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tachykinin-3 (ZNEUROK1) [Cleaved into: Neurokinin-B (NKB) (Neuromedin-K)]
GeneName	TAC3 NKNB UNQ585/PRO1155
Length	121
Function	Tachykinins are active peptides which excite neurons, evoke behavioral responses, are potent vasodilators and secretagogues, and contract (directly or indirectly) many smooth muscles (By similarity). Is a critical central regulator of gonadal function.
