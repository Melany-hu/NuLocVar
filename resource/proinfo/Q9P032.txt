UniprotID	Q9P032
Accession	Q9P032;B2R4J5
EntryName	NDUF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex assembly factor 4 (Hormone-regulated proliferation-associated protein of 20 kDa)
GeneName	NDUFAF4 C6orf66 HRPAP20 HSPC125 My013
Length	175
Function	Involved in the assembly of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I) (PubMed:18179882, PubMed:28853723). May be involved in cell proliferation and survival of hormone-dependent tumor cells. May be a regulator of breast tumor cell invasion.
