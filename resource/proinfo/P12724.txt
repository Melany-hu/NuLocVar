UniprotID	P12724
Accession	P12724;Q4VBC1;Q8WTP7;Q8WZ62;Q9GZN9
EntryName	ECP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) (EC 3.1.27.-) (Ribonuclease 3) (RNase 3)
GeneName	RNASE3 ECP RNS3
Length	160
Function	Cytotoxin and helminthotoxin with low-efficiency ribonuclease activity. Possesses a wide variety of biological activities. Exhibits antibacterial activity, including cytoplasmic membrane depolarization of preferentially Gram-negative, but also Gram-positive strains. Promotes E.coli outer membrane detachment, alteration of the overall cell shape and partial loss of cell content.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
