UniprotID	Q8TDF5
Accession	Q8TDF5;Q86W85;Q8ND78;Q8TDF4
EntryName	NETO1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuropilin and tolloid-like protein 1 (Brain-specific transmembrane protein containing 2 CUB and 1 LDL-receptor class A domains protein 1)
GeneName	NETO1 BTCL1
Length	533
Function	Involved in the development and/or maintenance of neuronal circuitry. Accessory subunit of the neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) critical for maintaining the abundance of GRIN2A-containing NMDARs in the postsynaptic density. Regulates long-term NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity and cognition, at least in the context of spatial learning and memory (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Postsynaptic density membrane; Cell membrane; Secreted
