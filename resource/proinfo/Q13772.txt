EntryName	NCOA4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCoA-4) (Androgen receptor coactivator 70 kDa protein) (70 kDa AR-activator) (70 kDa androgen receptor coactivator) (Androgen receptor-associated protein of 70 kDa) (Ferritin cargo receptor NCOA4) (Ret-activating protein ELE1)
GeneName	NCOA4 ARA70 ELE1 RFG
Length	614
Function	Cargo receptor for the autophagic turnover of the iron-binding ferritin complex, playing a central role in iron homeostasis (PubMed:25327288, PubMed:26436293). Acts as an adapter for delivery of ferritin to lysosomes and autophagic degradation of ferritin, a process named ferritinophagy (PubMed:25327288, PubMed:26436293). Targets the iron-binding ferritin complex to autolysosomes following starvation or iron depletion (PubMed:25327288). Ensures efficient erythropoiesis, possibly by regulating hemin-induced erythroid differentiation (PubMed:26436293). In some studies, has been shown to enhance the androgen receptor AR transcriptional activity as well as acting as ligand-independent coactivator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma (PubMed:10347167, PubMed:8643607). Another study shows only weak behavior as a coactivator for the androgen receptor and no alteration of the ligand responsiveness of the AR (PubMed:10517667). Binds to DNA replication origins, binding is not restricted to sites of active transcription and may likely be independent from the nuclear receptor transcriptional coactivator function (PubMed:24910095). May inhibit activation of DNA replication origins, possibly by obstructing DNA unwinding via interaction with the MCM2-7 complex (PubMed:24910095).
