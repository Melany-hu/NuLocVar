UniprotID	P15018
Accession	P15018;B2RCW7;B5MC23;Q52LZ2
EntryName	LIF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (Differentiation-stimulating factor) (D factor) (Melanoma-derived LPL inhibitor) (MLPLI) (Emfilermin)
GeneName	LIF HILDA
Length	202
Function	LIF has the capacity to induce terminal differentiation in leukemic cells. Its activities include the induction of hematopoietic differentiation in normal and myeloid leukemia cells, the induction of neuronal cell differentiation, and the stimulation of acute-phase protein synthesis in hepatocytes.
