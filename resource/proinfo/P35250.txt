Accession	P35250;B5BU07;D3DXG3;P32846;Q9BU93
EntryName	RFC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Replication factor C subunit 2 (Activator 1 40 kDa subunit) (A1 40 kDa subunit) (Activator 1 subunit 2) (Replication factor C 40 kDa subunit) (RF-C 40 kDa subunit) (RFC40)
GeneName	RFC2
Length	354
Function	Subunit of the replication factor C (RFC) complex which acts during elongation of primed DNA templates by DNA polymerases delta and epsilon, and is necessary for ATP-dependent loading of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto primed DNA (PubMed:9488738). This subunit binds ATP (By similarity).
