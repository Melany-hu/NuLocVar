UniprotID	Q53FP2
Accession	Q53FP2;Q9H7Y3
EntryName	NACHO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Novel acetylcholine receptor chaperone
GeneName	TMEM35A NACHO TMEM35
Length	167
Function	Molecular chaperone which mediates the proper assembly and functional expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) throughout the brain (PubMed:26875622, PubMed:27789755, PubMed:28445721, PubMed:32204458, PubMed:32783947). Essential for the proper folding, assembly, function and surface trafficking of alpha-7 (CHRNA7), alpha-4-beta-2, alpha-3-beta-2 and alpha-3-beta-4 receptors (PubMed:26875622, PubMed:27789755, PubMed:28445721, PubMed:32204458, PubMed:32783947). Stably associates with ribophorin-1 (RPN1) and ribophorin-2 (RPN2) (components of the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) complex) and with calnexin (CANX), both of which are critical for NACHO-mediated effects on CHRNA7 assembly and function (By similarity). Facilitates the proper folding and assembly of alpha-6-beta-2 and alpha-6-beta-2-beta-3 receptors and acts at early stages of the nAChRs subunit assembly (PubMed:28445721). Promotes the expression of the alpha-4(2):beta-2(3) stoichiometric form over the alpha-4(3):beta-2(2) form (PubMed:32676916).
