UniprotID	Q08431
Accession	Q08431;B2R6M7;F5GZN3;Q53FU9;Q7Z3D2;Q9BTL9
EntryName	MFGM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lactadherin (Breast epithelial antigen BA46) (HMFG) (MFGM) (Milk fat globule-EGF factor 8) (MFG-E8) (SED1) [Cleaved into: Lactadherin short form; Medin]
GeneName	MFGE8
Length	387
Function	Plays an important role in the maintenance of intestinal epithelial homeostasis and the promotion of mucosal healing. Promotes VEGF-dependent neovascularization (By similarity). Contributes to phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells in many tissues. Specific ligand for the alpha-v/beta-3 and alpha-v/beta-5 receptors. Also binds to phosphatidylserine-enriched cell surfaces in a receptor-independent manner. Zona pellucida-binding protein which may play a role in gamete interaction.
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Secreted; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Acrosome membrane
