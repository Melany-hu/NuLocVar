EntryName	NOCT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nocturnin (EC 3.1.3.108) (Carbon catabolite repression 4-like protein)
GeneName	NOCT CCR4 CCRN4L NOC
Length	431
Function	Phosphatase which catalyzes the conversion of NADP(+) to NAD(+) and of NADPH to NADH (PubMed:31147539). Shows a small preference for NADPH over NADP(+) (PubMed:31147539). Represses translation and promotes degradation of target mRNA molecules (PubMed:29860338). Plays an important role in post-transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes under circadian control (By similarity). Exerts a rhythmic post-transcriptional control of genes necessary for metabolic functions including nutrient absorption, glucose/insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, inflammation and osteogenesis (By similarity). Plays an important role in favoring adipogenesis over osteoblastogenesis and acts as a key regulator of the adipogenesis/osteogenesis balance (By similarity). Promotes adipogenesis by facilitating PPARG nuclear translocation which activates its transcriptional activity (By similarity). Regulates circadian expression of NOS2 in the liver and negatively regulates the circadian expression of IGF1 in the bone (By similarity). Critical for proper development of early embryos (By similarity).
