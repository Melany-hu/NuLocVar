UniprotID	P60329
Accession	P60329;Q08AF5
EntryName	KR124_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 12-4 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 12.4) (Keratin-associated protein 12.4)
GeneName	KRTAP12-4 KAP12.4 KRTAP12.4
Length	112
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
