Accession	Q16763;Q9BTC1
EntryName	UBE2S_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 S (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme S) (E2-EPF) (Ubiquitin carrier protein S) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-24 kDa) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-EPF5) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase S)
GeneName	UBE2S E2EPF OK/SW-cl.73
Length	222
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins (PubMed:19820702, PubMed:19822757, PubMed:22496338, PubMed:27259151). Catalyzes 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitination. Acts as an essential factor of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis (PubMed:19820702, PubMed:19822757, PubMed:27259151, PubMed:27910872). Acts by specifically elongating 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitin chains initiated by the E2 enzyme UBE2C/UBCH10 on APC/C substrates, enhancing the degradation of APC/C substrates by the proteasome and promoting mitotic exit (PubMed:19820702, PubMed:19822757, PubMed:27259151). Also acts by elongating ubiquitin chains initiated by the E2 enzyme UBE2D1/UBCH5 in vitro; it is however unclear whether UBE2D1/UBCH5 acts as an E2 enzyme for the APC/C in vivo. Also involved in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of VHL, resulting in an accumulation of HIF1A (PubMed:16819549). In vitro able to promote polyubiquitination using all 7 ubiquitin Lys residues, except 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:20061386, PubMed:20622874).
