UniprotID	P49888
Accession	P49888;Q8N6X5
EntryName	ST1E1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sulfotransferase 1E1 (ST1E1) (EC 2.8.2.4) (EST-1) (Estrogen sulfotransferase) (Sulfotransferase, estrogen-preferring)
GeneName	SULT1E1 STE
Length	294
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) as sulfonate donor to catalyze the sulfate conjugation of estradiol and estrone (PubMed:11006110, PubMed:11884392, PubMed:7779757). Is a key enzyme in estrogen homeostasis, the sulfation of estrogens leads to their inactivation. Also sulfates dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), pregnenolone, (24S)-hydroxycholesterol and xenobiotic compounds like ethinylestradiol, equalenin, diethyl stilbesterol and 1-naphthol at significantly lower efficiency (PubMed:11006110, PubMed:19589875). Does not sulfonate cortisol, testosterone and dopamine (PubMed:11006110, PubMed:7779757). May play a role in gut microbiota-host metabolic interaction. O-sulfonates 4-ethylphenol (4-EP), a dietary tyrosine-derived metabolite produced by gut bacteria. The product 4-EPS crosses the blood-brain barrier and may negatively regulate oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, affecting the functional connectivity of different brain regions associated with the limbic system.
