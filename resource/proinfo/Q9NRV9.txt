UniprotID	Q9NRV9
Accession	Q9NRV9;A8K1G2;Q9Y5Z5
EntryName	HEBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heme-binding protein 1 (p22HBP)
GeneName	HEBP1 HBP
Length	189
Function	May bind free porphyrinogens that may be present in the cell and thus facilitate removal of these potentially toxic compound. Binds with a high affinity to one molecule of heme or porphyrins. It binds metalloporphyrins, free porphyrins and N-methylprotoporphyrin with similar affinities.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
