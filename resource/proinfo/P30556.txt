EntryName	AGTR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1AR) (AT1BR) (Angiotensin II type-1 receptor) (AT1 receptor)
GeneName	AGTR1 AGTR1A AGTR1B AT2R1 AT2R1B
Length	359
Function	Receptor for angiotensin II, a vasoconstricting peptide, which acts as a key regulator of blood pressure and sodium retention by the kidney (PubMed:15611106, PubMed:1567413, PubMed:25913193, PubMed:26420482, PubMed:30639100, PubMed:32079768, PubMed:8987975). The activated receptor in turn couples to G-alpha proteins G(q) (GNAQ, GNA11, GNA14 or GNA15) and thus activates phospholipase C and increases the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations, which in turn triggers cellular responses such as stimulation of protein kinase C (PubMed:15611106).
