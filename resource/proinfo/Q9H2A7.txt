UniprotID	Q9H2A7
Accession	Q9H2A7;A0N0N4;A8K7U9;B2RCB0;Q8TC80;Q96K63;Q9BXD6;Q9H2F6
EntryName	CXL16_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-X-C motif chemokine 16 (Scavenger receptor for phosphatidylserine and oxidized low density lipoprotein) (SR-PSOX) (Small-inducible cytokine B16) (Transmembrane chemokine CXCL16)
GeneName	CXCL16 SCYB16 SRPSOX UNQ2759/PRO6714
Length	254
Function	Acts as a scavenger receptor on macrophages, which specifically binds to OxLDL (oxidized low density lipoprotein), suggesting that it may be involved in pathophysiology such as atherogenesis (By similarity). Induces a strong chemotactic response. Induces calcium mobilization. Binds to CXCR6/Bonzo.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted
