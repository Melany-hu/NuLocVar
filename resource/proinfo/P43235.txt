UniprotID	P43235
Accession	P43235;Q6FHS6
EntryName	CATK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cathepsin K (EC 3.4.22.38) (Cathepsin O) (Cathepsin O2) (Cathepsin X)
GeneName	CTSK CTSO CTSO2
Length	329
Function	Thiol protease involved in osteoclastic bone resorption and may participate partially in the disorder of bone remodeling. Displays potent endoprotease activity against fibrinogen at acid pH. May play an important role in extracellular matrix degradation. Involved in the release of thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) by limited proteolysis of TG/thyroglobulin in the thyroid follicle lumen (PubMed:11082042).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome; Secreted; Apical cell membrane
