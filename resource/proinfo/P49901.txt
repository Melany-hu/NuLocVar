UniprotID	P49901
Accession	P49901;Q96A42
EntryName	MCSP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sperm mitochondrial-associated cysteine-rich protein
GeneName	SMCP MCS MCSP
Length	116
Function	Involved in sperm motility. Its absence is associated with genetic background dependent male infertility. Infertility may be due to reduced sperm motility in the female reproductive tract and inability to penetrate the oocyte zona pellucida (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Mitochondrion membrane
