EntryName	PAR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) (Coagulation factor II receptor) (Thrombin receptor)
GeneName	F2R CF2R PAR1 TR
Length	425
Function	High affinity receptor that binds the activated thrombin, leading to calcium release from intracellular stores (PubMed:1672265, PubMed:8136362). The thrombin-activated receptor signaling pathway is mediated through PTX-insensitive G proteins, activation of phospholipase C resulting in the production of 1D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) which binds to InsP3 receptors causing calcium release from the stores (By similarity). In astrocytes, the calcium released into the cytosol allows the Ca(2+)-dependent release of L-glutamate into the synaptic cleft through BEST1, that targets the neuronal postsynaptic GRIN2A/NMDAR receptor resulting in the synaptic plasticity regulation (By similarity). May play a role in platelets activation and in vascular development (PubMed:10079109). Mediates up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as MCP-1/CCL2 and IL6, triggered by coagulation factor Xa (F10) in cardiac fibroblasts and umbilical vein endothelial cells (PubMed:30568593, PubMed:34831181).
