UniprotID	Q96LI5
Accession	Q96LI5;Q9UF92
EntryName	CNO6L_HUMAN
ProteinName	CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 6-like (EC 3.1.13.4) (Carbon catabolite repressor protein 4 homolog B)
GeneName	CNOT6L CCR4B
Length	555
Function	Has 3'-5' poly(A) exoribonuclease activity for synthetic poly(A) RNA substrate. Catalytic component of the CCR4-NOT complex which is one of the major cellular mRNA deadenylases and is linked to various cellular processes including bulk mRNA degradation, miRNA-mediated repression, translational repression during translational initiation and general transcription regulation. Additional complex functions may be a consequence of its influence on mRNA expression. May be involved in the deadenylation-dependent degradation of mRNAs through the 3'-UTR AU-rich element-mediated mechanism. Involved in deadenylation-dependent degradation of CDKN1B mRNA. Its mRNA deadenylase activity can be inhibited by TOB1. Mediates cell proliferation and cell survival and prevents cellular senescence.
