UniprotID	Q12805
Accession	Q12805;A8K3I4;B4DW75;D6W5D2;Q541U7
EntryName	FBLN3_HUMAN
ProteinName	EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (Extracellular protein S1-5) (Fibrillin-like protein) (Fibulin-3) (FIBL-3)
GeneName	EFEMP1 FBLN3 FBNL
Length	493
Function	Binds EGFR, the EGF receptor, inducing EGFR autophosphorylation and the activation of downstream signaling pathways. May play a role in cell adhesion and migration. May function as a negative regulator of chondrocyte differentiation. In the olfactory epithelium, it may regulate glial cell migration, differentiation and the ability of glial cells to support neuronal neurite outgrowth.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Extracellular space; Extracellular matrix
