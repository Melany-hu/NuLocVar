UniprotID	P12532
Accession	P12532;B4DIT8;B7ZA09;Q0VAM3;Q32NF6;Q53FC4
EntryName	KCRU_HUMAN
ProteinName	Creatine kinase U-type, mitochondrial (EC 2.7.3.2) (Acidic-type mitochondrial creatine kinase) (Mia-CK) (Ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase) (U-MtCK)
GeneName	CKMT1A CKMT; CKMT1B CKMT
Length	417
Function	Reversibly catalyzes the transfer of phosphate between ATP and various phosphogens (e.g. creatine phosphate). Creatine kinase isoenzymes play a central role in energy transduction in tissues with large, fluctuating energy demands, such as skeletal muscle, heart, brain and spermatozoa.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
