UniprotID	Q9BR09
Accession	Q9BR09;Q3KR34
EntryName	NEUL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuralized-like protein 2
GeneName	NEURL2 C20orf163
Length	285
Function	Plays an important role in the process of myofiber differentiation and maturation. Probable substrate-recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin BC-CUL2/5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination of proteins. Probably contributes to catalysis through recognition and positioning of the substrate and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. During myogenesis, controls the ubiquitination and degradation of the specific pool of CTNNB1/beta-catenin located at the sarcolemma (By similarity).
