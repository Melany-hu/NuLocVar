UniprotID	P61964
Accession	P61964;Q91VA5;Q9NWX7;Q9UGP9
EntryName	WDR5_HUMAN
ProteinName	WD repeat-containing protein 5 (BMP2-induced 3-kb gene protein)
GeneName	WDR5 BIG3
Length	334
Function	Contributes to histone modification (PubMed:16600877, PubMed:16829960, PubMed:19103755, PubMed:19131338, PubMed:19556245, PubMed:20018852). May position the N-terminus of histone H3 for efficient trimethylation at 'Lys-4' (PubMed:16829960). As part of the MLL1/MLL complex it is involved in methylation and dimethylation at 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (PubMed:19556245). H3 'Lys-4' methylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation (PubMed:18840606). As part of the NSL complex it may be involved in acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 on several lysine residues (PubMed:19103755, PubMed:20018852). May regulate osteoblasts differentiation (By similarity). In association with RBBP5 and ASH2L, stimulates the histone methyltransferase activities of KMT2A, KMT2B, KMT2C, KMT2D, SETD1A and SETD1B (PubMed:21220120, PubMed:22266653).
