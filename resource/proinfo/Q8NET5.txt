UniprotID	Q8NET5
Accession	Q8NET5;B0QYD0;Q20WL2;Q5JZ96;Q8IUY8;Q8TEM8
EntryName	NFAM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	NFAT activation molecule 1 (Calcineurin/NFAT-activating ITAM-containing protein) (NFAT-activating protein with ITAM motif 1)
GeneName	NFAM1 CNAIP
Length	270
Function	May function in immune system as a receptor which activates via the calcineurin/NFAT-signaling pathway the downstream cytokine gene promoters. Activates the transcription of IL-13 and TNF-alpha promoters. May be involved in the regulation of B-cell, but not T-cell, development. Overexpression activates downstream effectors without ligand binding or antibody cross-linking.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
