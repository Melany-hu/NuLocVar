UniprotID	Q15669
Accession	Q15669
EntryName	RHOH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoH (GTP-binding protein TTF) (Translocation three four protein)
GeneName	RHOH ARHH TTF
Length	191
Function	Negative regulator of hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation, survival and migration. Critical regulator of thymocyte development and T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling by mediating recruitment and activation of ZAP70. Required for phosphorylation of CD3Z, membrane translocation of ZAP70 and subsequent activation of the ZAP70-mediated pathways. Essential for efficient beta-selection and positive selection by promoting the ZAP70-dependent phosphorylation of the LAT signalosome during pre-TCR and TCR signaling. Crucial for thymocyte maturation during DN3 to DN4 transition and during positive selection. Plays critical roles in mast cell function by facilitating phosphorylation of SYK in Fc epsilon RI-mediated signal transduction. Essential for the phosphorylation of LAT, LCP2, PLCG1 and PLCG2 and for Ca(2+) mobilization in mast cells (By similarity). Binds GTP but lacks intrinsic GTPase activity and is resistant to Rho-specific GTPase-activating proteins. Inhibits the activation of NF-kappa-B by TNF and IKKB and the activation of CRK/p38 by TNF. Inhibits activities of RAC1, RHOA and CDC42. Negatively regulates leukotriene production in neutrophils.
