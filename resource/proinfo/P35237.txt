UniprotID	P35237
Accession	P35237;B2RBA8;Q59F97;Q5TD06;Q7Z2Y7;Q96J44;Q9UDI7
EntryName	SPB6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serpin B6 (Cytoplasmic antiproteinase) (CAP) (Peptidase inhibitor 6) (PI-6) (Placental thrombin inhibitor)
GeneName	SERPINB6 PI6 PTI
Length	376
Function	May be involved in the regulation of serine proteinases present in the brain or extravasated from the blood (By similarity). Inhibitor of cathepsin G, kallikrein-8 and thrombin. May play an important role in the inner ear in the protection against leakage of lysosomal content during stress and loss of this protection results in cell death and sensorineural hearing loss.
