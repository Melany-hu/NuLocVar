UniprotID	O75496
Accession	O75496;B3KMM8;Q9H1Z1
EntryName	GEMI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Geminin
GeneName	GMNN
Length	209
Function	Inhibits DNA replication by preventing the incorporation of MCM complex into pre-replication complex (pre-RC) (PubMed:14993212, PubMed:20129055, PubMed:24064211, PubMed:9635433). It is degraded during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle (PubMed:14993212, PubMed:24064211, PubMed:9635433). Its destruction at the metaphase-anaphase transition permits replication in the succeeding cell cycle (PubMed:14993212, PubMed:24064211, PubMed:9635433). Inhibits histone acetyltransferase activity of KAT7/HBO1 in a CDT1-dependent manner, inhibiting histone H4 acetylation and DNA replication licensing (PubMed:20129055). Inhibits the transcriptional activity of a subset of Hox proteins, enrolling them in cell proliferative control (PubMed:22615398).
