UniprotID	O15524
Accession	O15524;O15097;Q9NSA7
EntryName	SOCS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) (JAK-binding protein) (JAB) (STAT-induced STAT inhibitor 1) (SSI-1) (Tec-interacting protein 3) (TIP-3)
GeneName	SOCS1 SSI1 TIP3
Length	211
Function	Essential negative regulator of type I and type II interferon (IFN) signaling, as well as that of other cytokines, including IL2, IL4, IL6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (PubMed:32499645, PubMed:33087723). Downregulates cytokine signaling by inhibiting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Acts by binding to JAK proteins and to IFNGR1 and inhibiting their kinase activity. In vitro, suppresses Tec protein-tyrosine activity (PubMed:9341160). Regulates IFN-gamma (IFNG)-mediated sensory neuron survival (By similarity). Probable substrate recognition component of an ECS (Elongin BC-CUL2/5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:11278610, PubMed:11313480).
