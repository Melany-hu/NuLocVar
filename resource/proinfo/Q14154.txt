UniprotID	Q14154
Accession	Q14154;Q969R4;Q96EU9
EntryName	DELE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	DAP3-binding cell death enhancer 1 (DAP3-binding cell death enhancer 1, long form) (DELE1(L)) (Death ligand signal enhancer) [Cleaved into: DAP3-binding cell death enhancer 1 short form (DELE1(S)) (S-DELE1) (cDELE1)]
GeneName	DELE1 DELE KIAA0141
Length	515
Function	Protein kinase activator that acts as a key activator of the integrated stress response (ISR) following various stresses, such as iron deficiency, mitochondrial stress or mitochondrial DNA breaks (PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707, PubMed:35388015, PubMed:37327776, PubMed:37550454, PubMed:37832546, PubMed:38340717). Detects impaired protein import and processing in mitochondria, activating the ISR (PubMed:35388015). May also required for the induction of death receptor-mediated apoptosis through the regulation of caspase activation (PubMed:20563667).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion; Mitochondrion outer membrane; Mitochondrion inner membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytosol
