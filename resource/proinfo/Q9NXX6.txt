EntryName	NSE4A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Non-structural maintenance of chromosomes element 4 homolog A (NS4EA) (Non-SMC element 4 homolog A)
GeneName	NSMCE4A C10orf86 PP4762
Length	385
Function	Component of the SMC5-SMC6 complex, a complex involved in DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination. The complex may promote sister chromatid homologous recombination by recruiting the SMC1-SMC3 cohesin complex to double-strand breaks. The complex is required for telomere maintenance via recombination in ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres) cell lines and mediates sumoylation of shelterin complex (telosome) components which is proposed to lead to shelterin complex disassembly in ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). Is involved in positive regulation of response to DNA damage stimulus.
