UniprotID	Q5TA77
Accession	Q5TA77
EntryName	LCE3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Late cornified envelope protein 3B (Late envelope protein 14)
GeneName	LCE3B LEP14
Length	95
Function	A structural component of the cornified envelope of the stratum corneum involved in innate cutaneous host defense (Probable). Possesses defensin-like antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic species. Upon inflammation, may regulate skin barrier repair by shaping cutaneous microbiota composition and immune response to bacterial antigens (PubMed:28634035).
