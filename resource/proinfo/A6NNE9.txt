UniprotID	A6NNE9
Accession	A6NNE9;A7E2S6
EntryName	MARHB_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MARCHF11 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Membrane-associated RING finger protein 11) (Membrane-associated RING-CH protein XI) (MARCH-XI) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase MARCHF11)
GeneName	MARCHF11 MARCH11
Length	402
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates polyubiquitination of CD4. E3 ubiquitin ligases accept ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester and then directly transfer the ubiquitin to targeted substrates. May play a role in ubuquitin-dependent protein sorting in developmenting spermatids.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane
