EntryName	LTOR5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ragulator complex protein LAMTOR5 (Hepatitis B virus X-interacting protein) (HBV X-interacting protein) (HBX-interacting protein) (Late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor and MAPK and MTOR activator 5)
GeneName	LAMTOR5 HBXIP XIP
Length	91
Function	As part of the Ragulator complex it is involved in amino acid sensing and activation of mTORC1, a signaling complex promoting cell growth in response to growth factors, energy levels, and amino acids (PubMed:22980980, PubMed:29158492, PubMed:30181260). Activated by amino acids through a mechanism involving the lysosomal V-ATPase, the Ragulator plays a dual role for the small GTPases Rag (RagA/RRAGA, RagB/RRAGB, RagC/RRAGC and/or RagD/RRAGD): it (1) acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), activating the small GTPases Rag and (2) mediates recruitment of Rag GTPases to the lysosome membrane (PubMed:22980980, PubMed:28935770, PubMed:29107538, PubMed:29158492, PubMed:30181260). Activated Ragulator and Rag GTPases function as a scaffold recruiting mTORC1 to lysosomes where it is in turn activated (PubMed:22980980, PubMed:29158492, PubMed:30181260). When complexed to BIRC5, interferes with apoptosome assembly, preventing recruitment of pro-caspase-9 to oligomerized APAF1, thereby selectively suppressing apoptosis initiated via the mitochondrial/cytochrome c pathway (PubMed:12773388).
