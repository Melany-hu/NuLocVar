UniprotID	Q96KX2
Accession	Q96KX2;Q969J0
EntryName	CAZA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-actin-capping protein subunit alpha-3 (CapZ alpha-3) (CP-alpha-3) (Germ cell-specific protein 3)
GeneName	CAPZA3 CAPAA3 GSG3
Length	299
Function	F-actin-capping proteins bind in a Ca(2+)-independent manner to the fast growing ends of actin filaments (barbed end) thereby blocking the exchange of subunits at these ends. Unlike other capping proteins (such as gelsolin and severin), these proteins do not sever actin filaments. May play a role in the morphogenesis of spermatid (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
