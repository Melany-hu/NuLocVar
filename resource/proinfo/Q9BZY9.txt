EntryName	TRI31_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM31 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Tripartite motif-containing protein 31)
GeneName	TRIM31 C6orf13 RNF
Length	425
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that acts as a regulator of antiviral immune response and inflammation by mediating ubiquitination of substrates (PubMed:18773414, PubMed:27929086, PubMed:27992402). Acts as a regulator of innate immune defense against viruses by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of MAVS, promoting MAVS polymerization and formation of three-stranded helical filaments on mitochondria (PubMed:27992402). Acts as a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome by catalyzing 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination of NLRP3, leading to its degradation (PubMed:27929086). Regulator of Src-induced anchorage independent cell growth (By similarity).
