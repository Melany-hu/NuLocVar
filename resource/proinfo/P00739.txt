UniprotID	P00739
Accession	P00739;Q7LE20;Q92658;Q92659;Q9ULB0
EntryName	HPTR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Haptoglobin-related protein
GeneName	HPR
Length	348
Function	Primate-specific plasma protein associated with apolipoprotein L-I (apoL-I)-containing high-density lipoprotein (HDL). This HDL particle, termed trypanosome lytic factor-1 (TLF-1), mediates human innate immune protection against many species of African trypanosomes. Binds hemoglobin with high affinity and may contribute to the clearance of cell-free hemoglobin to allow hepatic recycling of heme iron.
