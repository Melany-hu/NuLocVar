UniprotID	Q03933
Accession	Q03933;B4DGJ4;Q0VAH9;Q2M1K4;Q9H445
EntryName	HSF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heat shock factor protein 2 (HSF 2) (Heat shock transcription factor 2) (HSTF 2)
GeneName	HSF2 HSTF2
Length	536
Function	DNA-binding protein that specifically binds heat shock promoter elements (HSE) and activates transcription. In higher eukaryotes, HSF is unable to bind to the HSE unless the cells are heat shocked.
