EntryName	KTNA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Katanin p60 ATPase-containing subunit A1 (Katanin p60 subunit A1) (EC 5.6.1.1) (p60 katanin)
GeneName	KATNA1
Length	491
Function	Catalytic subunit of a complex which severs microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner. Microtubule severing may promote rapid reorganization of cellular microtubule arrays and the release of microtubules from the centrosome following nucleation. Microtubule release from the mitotic spindle poles may allow depolymerization of the microtubule end proximal to the spindle pole, leading to poleward microtubule flux and poleward motion of chromosome. Microtubule release within the cell body of neurons may be required for their transport into neuronal processes by microtubule-dependent motor proteins. This transport is required for axonal growth.
