UniprotID	Q04743
Accession	Q04743;G3V305;Q96NN8;Q9BQF4
EntryName	EMX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein EMX2 (Empty spiracles homolog 2) (Empty spiracles-like protein 2)
GeneName	EMX2
Length	252
Function	Transcription factor, which in cooperation with EMX1, acts to generate the boundary between the roof and archipallium in the developing brain. May function in combination with OTX1/2 to specify cell fates in the developing central nervous system. In the inner ear, it controls the distribution of GPR156 at hair cell boundaries, and regulates the organization of stereociliary bundles in opposite orientations across the line of polarity reversal (LPR).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cell projection; Axon
