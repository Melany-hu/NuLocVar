EntryName	DDX11_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP-dependent DNA helicase DDX11 (EC 5.6.2.3) (CHL1-related protein 1) (hCHLR1) (DEAD/H-box protein 11) (DNA 5'-3' helicase DDX11) (Keratinocyte growth factor-regulated gene 2 protein) (KRG-2)
GeneName	DDX11 CHL1 CHLR1 KRG2
Length	970
Function	DNA-dependent ATPase and ATP-dependent DNA helicase that participates in various functions in genomic stability, including DNA replication, DNA repair and heterochromatin organization as well as in ribosomal RNA synthesis (PubMed:10648783, PubMed:21854770, PubMed:23797032, PubMed:26089203, PubMed:26503245). Its double-stranded DNA helicase activity requires either a minimal 5'-single-stranded tail length of approximately 15 nt (flap substrates) or 10 nt length single-stranded gapped DNA substrates of a partial duplex DNA structure for helicase loading and translocation along DNA in a 5' to 3' direction (PubMed:10648783, PubMed:18499658, PubMed:22102414). The helicase activity is capable of displacing duplex regions up to 100 bp, which can be extended up to 500 bp by the replication protein A (RPA) or the cohesion CTF18-replication factor C (Ctf18-RFC) complex activities (PubMed:18499658). Also shows ATPase- and helicase activities on substrates that mimic key DNA intermediates of replication, repair and homologous recombination reactions, including forked duplex, anti-parallel G-quadruplex and three-stranded D-loop DNA molecules (PubMed:22102414, PubMed:26503245). Plays a role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair at the DNA replication fork during DNA replication recovery from DNA damage (PubMed:23797032). Recruited with TIMELESS factor upon DNA-replication stress response at DNA replication fork to preserve replication fork progression, and hence ensure DNA replication fidelity (PubMed:26503245). Also cooperates with TIMELESS factor during DNA replication to regulate proper sister chromatid cohesion and mitotic chromosome segregation (PubMed:17105772, PubMed:18499658, PubMed:20124417, PubMed:23116066, PubMed:23797032). Stimulates 5'-single-stranded DNA flap endonuclease activity of FEN1 in an ATP- and helicase-independent manner; and hence it may contribute in Okazaki fragment processing at DNA replication fork during lagging strand DNA synthesis (PubMed:18499658). Its ability to function at DNA replication fork is modulated by its binding to long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) cohesion regulator non-coding RNA DDX11-AS1/CONCR, which is able to increase both DDX11 ATPase activity and binding to DNA replicating regions (PubMed:27477908). Also plays a role in heterochromatin organization (PubMed:21854770). Involved in rRNA transcription activation through binding to active hypomethylated rDNA gene loci by recruiting UBTF and the RNA polymerase Pol I transcriptional machinery (PubMed:26089203). Plays a role in embryonic development and prevention of aneuploidy (By similarity). Involved in melanoma cell proliferation and survival (PubMed:23116066). Associates with chromatin at DNA replication fork regions (PubMed:27477908). Binds to single- and double-stranded DNAs (PubMed:18499658, PubMed:22102414, PubMed:9013641).
