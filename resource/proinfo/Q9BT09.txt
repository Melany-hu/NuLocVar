UniprotID	Q9BT09
Accession	Q9BT09;O15412;Q0P6I2;Q8NF54;Q8WTU8;Q9P0F2
EntryName	CNPY3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein canopy homolog 3 (CTG repeat protein 4a) (Expanded repeat-domain protein CAG/CTG 5) (Protein associated with TLR4) (Trinucleotide repeat-containing gene 5 protein)
GeneName	CNPY3 CTG4A ERDA5 PRAT4A TNRC5 HSPC084 UNQ1934/PRO4409
Length	278
Function	Toll-like receptor (TLR)-specific co-chaperone for HSP90B1. Required for proper TLR folding, except that of TLR3, and hence controls TLR exit from the endoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, required for both innate and adaptive immune responses (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum
