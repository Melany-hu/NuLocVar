UniprotID	P27482
Accession	P27482;B2R9V6;Q5SQI4
EntryName	CALL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calmodulin-like protein 3 (CaM-like protein) (CLP) (Calmodulin-related protein NB-1)
GeneName	CALML3
Length	149
Function	May function as a specific light chain of unconventional myosin-10 (MYO10), also enhances MYO10 translation, possibly by acting as a chaperone for the emerging MYO10 heavy chain protein. May compete with calmodulin by binding, with different affinities, to cellular substrates.
