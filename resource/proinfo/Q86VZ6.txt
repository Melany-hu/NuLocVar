UniprotID	Q86VZ6
Accession	Q86VZ6;A4D195;Q8N3L7
EntryName	JAZF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Juxtaposed with another zinc finger protein 1 (TAK1-interacting protein 27) (Zinc finger protein 802)
GeneName	JAZF1 TIP27 ZNF802
Length	243
Function	Acts as a transcriptional corepressor of orphan nuclear receptor NR2C2 (PubMed:15302918). Inhibits expression of the gluconeogenesis enzyme PCK2 through inhibition of NR2C2 activity (By similarity). Also involved in transcriptional activation of NAMPT by promoting expression of PPARA and PPARD (By similarity). Plays a role in lipid metabolism by suppressing lipogenesis, increasing lipolysis and decreasing lipid accumulation in adipose tissue (By similarity). Plays a role in glucose homeostasis by improving glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity (By similarity).
