UniprotID	O00628
Accession	O00628;C0H5X6
EntryName	PEX7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisomal targeting signal 2 receptor (PTS2 receptor) (Peroxin-7)
GeneName	PEX7 PTS2R
Length	323
Function	Receptor required for the peroxisomal import of proteins containing a C-terminal PTS2-type peroxisomal targeting signal (PubMed:11931631, PubMed:22057399, PubMed:25538232, PubMed:9090381). Specifically binds to cargo proteins containing a PTS2 peroxisomal targeting signal in the cytosol (PubMed:11931631, PubMed:22057399, PubMed:25538232). Cargo protein-binding triggers interaction with PEX5 and formation of a ternary complex composed of PEX5 and PEX7 along with PTS2-containing cargo proteins, which is tranlocated into peroxisomes by passing through the PEX13-PEX14 docking complex (PubMed:11546814, PubMed:25538232).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Peroxisome matrix
