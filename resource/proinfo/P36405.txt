UniprotID	P36405
Accession	P36405;B2R6C7;Q53X83;Q5JSM2
EntryName	ARL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 3
GeneName	ARL3 ARFL3
Length	182
Function	Small GTP-binding protein which cycles between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound form, and the rate of cycling is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) (PubMed:16525022, PubMed:18588884). Required for normal cytokinesis and cilia signaling (PubMed:22085962). Requires assistance from GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) like RP2 and PDE6D, in order to cycle between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound forms. Required for targeting proteins to the cilium, including myristoylated NPHP3 and prenylated INPP5E (PubMed:30269812). Targets NPHP3 to the ciliary membrane by releasing myristoylated NPHP3 from UNC119B cargo adapter into the cilium (PubMed:22085962). Required for PKD1:PKD2 complex targeting from the trans-Golgi network to the cilium (By similarity).
