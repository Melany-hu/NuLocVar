ProteinName	5'-AMP-activated protein kinase subunit gamma-1 (AMPK gamma1) (AMPK subunit gamma-1) (AMPKg)
GeneName	PRKAG1
Length	331
Function	AMP/ATP-binding subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor protein kinase that plays a key role in regulating cellular energy metabolism (PubMed:21680840, PubMed:24563466). In response to reduction of intracellular ATP levels, AMPK activates energy-producing pathways and inhibits energy-consuming processes: inhibits protein, carbohydrate and lipid biosynthesis, as well as cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:21680840, PubMed:24563466). AMPK acts via direct phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes, and by longer-term effects via phosphorylation of transcription regulators (PubMed:21680840, PubMed:24563466). Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton; probably by indirectly activating myosin (PubMed:21680840, PubMed:24563466). Gamma non-catalytic subunit mediates binding to AMP, ADP and ATP, leading to activate or inhibit AMPK: AMP-binding results in allosteric activation of alpha catalytic subunit (PRKAA1 or PRKAA2) both by inducing phosphorylation and preventing dephosphorylation of catalytic subunits (PubMed:21680840, PubMed:24563466). ADP also stimulates phosphorylation, without stimulating already phosphorylated catalytic subunit (PubMed:21680840, PubMed:24563466). ATP promotes dephosphorylation of catalytic subunit, rendering the AMPK enzyme inactive (PubMed:21680840, PubMed:24563466).
