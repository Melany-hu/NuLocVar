UniprotID	P60409
Accession	P60409;Q0VDJ8;Q70LJ2
EntryName	KR107_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 10-7 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.7) (Keratin-associated protein 10.7) (Keratin-associated protein 18-7) (Keratin-associated protein 18.7)
GeneName	KRTAP10-7 KAP10.7 KAP18-7 KRTAP10.7 KRTAP18-7 KRTAP18.7
Length	370
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
