UniprotID	P35914
Accession	P35914;B4DUP4;B7UCC6;D3Y5K7;Q6IBC0;Q96FP8
EntryName	HMGCL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase, mitochondrial (HL) (HMG-CoA lyase) (EC 4.1.3.4) (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate-CoA lyase)
GeneName	HMGCL
Length	325
Function	Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase that catalyzes a cation-dependent cleavage of (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA into acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate, a key step in ketogenesis. Terminal step in leucine catabolism. Ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone) are essential as an alternative source of energy to glucose, as lipid precursors and as regulators of metabolism.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix; Peroxisome
