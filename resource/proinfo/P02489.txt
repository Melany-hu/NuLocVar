UniprotID	P02489
Accession	P02489;A0A140G945;E9PHE4;Q53X53
EntryName	CRYAA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-crystallin A chain (Heat shock protein beta-4) (HspB4) (Heat shock protein family B member 4) [Cleaved into: Alpha-crystallin A(1-172); Alpha-crystallin A(1-168); Alpha-crystallin A(1-162)]
GeneName	CRYAA CRYA1 HSPB4
Length	173
Function	Contributes to the transparency and refractive index of the lens (PubMed:18302245). In its oxidized form (absence of intramolecular disulfide bond), acts as a chaperone, preventing aggregation of various proteins under a wide range of stress conditions (PubMed:18199971, PubMed:19595763, PubMed:22120592, PubMed:31792453). Required for the correct formation of lens intermediate filaments as part of a complex composed of BFSP1, BFSP2 and CRYAA (PubMed:28935373).
