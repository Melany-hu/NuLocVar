UniprotID	Q96RK1
Accession	Q96RK1
EntryName	CITE4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator 4 (MSG1-related protein 2) (MRG-2)
GeneName	CITED4 MRG2
Length	184
Function	Acts as a transcriptional coactivator for TFAP2/AP-2. Enhances estrogen-dependent transactivation mediated by estrogen receptors. May function as an inhibitor of transactivation by HIF1A by disrupting HIF1A interaction with CREBBP. May be involved in regulation of gene expression during development and differentiation of blood cells, endothelial cells and mammary epithelial cells.
