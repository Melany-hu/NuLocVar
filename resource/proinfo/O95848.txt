UniprotID	O95848
Accession	O95848;Q86SJ8
EntryName	NUD14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Uridine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphatase NUDT14 (UDPG pyrophosphatase) (UGPPase) (EC 3.6.1.45) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 14) (Nudix motif 14)
GeneName	NUDT14 UGPP
Length	222
Function	Hydrolyzes UDP-glucose to glucose 1-phosphate and UMP and ADP-ribose to ribose 5-phosphate and AMP. The physiological substrate is probably UDP-glucose. Poor activity on other substrates such as ADP-glucose, CDP-glucose, GDP-glucose and GDP-mannose.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
