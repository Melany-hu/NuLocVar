UniprotID	P48039
Accession	P48039;A0AVC5;B0M0L2
EntryName	MTR1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Melatonin receptor type 1A (Mel-1A-R) (Mel1a receptor)
GeneName	MTNR1A
Length	350
Function	High affinity receptor for melatonin. Likely to mediate the reproductive and circadian actions of melatonin. The activity of this receptor is mediated by pertussis toxin sensitive G proteins that inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. Possibly involved in sleep induction, by melatonin activation of the potassium channel KCNMA1/BK and the dissociation of G-beta and G-gamma subunits, thereby decreasing synaptic transmission (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
