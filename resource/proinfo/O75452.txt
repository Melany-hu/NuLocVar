UniprotID	O75452
Accession	O75452;Q9UNV2
EntryName	RDH16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinol dehydrogenase 16 (EC 1.1.1.105) (EC 1.1.1.209) (EC 1.1.1.315) (EC 1.1.1.53) (Human epidermal retinol dehydrogenase) (hRDH-E) (Microsomal NAD(+)-dependent retinol dehydrogenase 4) (RoDH-4) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 8) (Sterol/retinol dehydrogenase)
GeneName	RDH16 RODH4 SDR9C8
Length	317
Function	Oxidoreductase with a preference for NAD. Oxidizes all-trans-retinol, 9-cis-retinol, 11-cis-retinol and 13-cis-retinol to the corresponding aldehydes (PubMed:10329026, PubMed:12534290, PubMed:9677409). Has higher activity towards CRBP-bound retinol than with free retinol (PubMed:12534290). Also oxidizes 3-alpha-hydroxysteroids. Oxidizes androstanediol and androsterone to dihydrotestosterone and androstanedione. Can also catalyze the reverse reaction (PubMed:10329026, PubMed:29541409, PubMed:9677409).
Subcellular Location	Microsome membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
