UniprotID	Q9H008
Accession	Q9H008;B3KP20;Q2TBE9;Q5VUV9;Q5VUW0
EntryName	LHPP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase (hLHPP) (EC 3.1.3.-) (EC 3.6.1.1)
GeneName	LHPP
Length	270
Function	Phosphatase that hydrolyzes imidodiphosphate, 3-phosphohistidine and 6-phospholysine. Has broad substrate specificity and can also hydrolyze inorganic diphosphate, but with lower efficiency (By similarity).
