UniprotID	O95858
Accession	O95858;Q6UW79
EntryName	TSN15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tetraspanin-15 (Tspan-15) (Tetraspan NET-7) (Transmembrane 4 superfamily member 15)
GeneName	TSPAN15 NET7 TM4SF15 UNQ677/PRO1311
Length	294
Function	Part of TspanC8 subgroup, composed of 6 members that interact with the transmembrane metalloprotease ADAM10. This interaction is required for ADAM10 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and for enzymatic maturation and trafficking to the cell surface as well as substrate specificity. Different TspanC8/ADAM10 complexes have distinct substrates (PubMed:26686862, PubMed:30463011, PubMed:31792032, PubMed:34739841). Promotes ADAM10-mediated cleavage of CDH2 (PubMed:34739841). Negatively regulates ligand-induced Notch activity probably by regulating ADAM10 activity (PubMed:26686862, PubMed:31792032).
