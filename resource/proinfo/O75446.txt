UniprotID	O75446
Accession	O75446;D3DP38
EntryName	SAP30_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone deacetylase complex subunit SAP30 (30 kDa Sin3-associated polypeptide) (Sin3 corepressor complex subunit SAP30) (Sin3-associated polypeptide p30)
GeneName	SAP30
Length	220
Function	Involved in the functional recruitment of the Sin3-histone deacetylase complex (HDAC) to a specific subset of N-CoR corepressor complexes. Capable of transcription repression by N-CoR. Active in deacetylating core histone octamers (when in a complex) but inactive in deacetylating nucleosomal histones.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
