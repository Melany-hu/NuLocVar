UniprotID	Q8WTS1
Accession	Q8WTS1;B2R9K0;Q9Y369
EntryName	ABHD5_HUMAN
ProteinName	1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase ABHD5 (EC 2.3.1.51) (Abhydrolase domain-containing protein 5) (Lipid droplet-binding protein CGI-58)
GeneName	ABHD5 NCIE2 CGI-58
Length	349
Function	Coenzyme A-dependent lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of an acyl group on a lysophosphatidic acid (PubMed:18606822). Functions preferentially with 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid followed by 1-palmitoyl-lysophosphatidic acid, 1-stearoyl-lysophosphatidic acid and 1-arachidonoyl-lysophosphatidic acid as lipid acceptor. Functions preferentially with arachidonoyl-CoA followed by oleoyl-CoA as acyl group donors (By similarity). Functions in phosphatidic acid biosynthesis (PubMed:18606822). May regulate the cellular storage of triacylglycerol through activation of the phospholipase PNPLA2 (PubMed:16679289). Involved in keratinocyte differentiation (PubMed:18832586). Regulates lipid droplet fusion (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Lipid droplet; Cytoplasm; Cytosol
