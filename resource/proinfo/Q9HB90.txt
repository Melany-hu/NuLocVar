EntryName	RRAGC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related GTP-binding protein C (Rag C) (RagC) (EC 3.6.5.-) (GTPase-interacting protein 2) (TIB929)
GeneName	RRAGC
Length	399
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the cellular response to amino acid availability through regulation of the mTORC1 signaling cascade (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279, PubMed:27234373, PubMed:31601708, PubMed:31601764, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:34071043, PubMed:36697823, PubMed:37057673). Forms heterodimeric Rag complexes with RagA/RRAGA or RagB/RRAGB and cycles between an inactive GTP-bound and an active GDP-bound form: RagC/RRAGC is in its active form when GDP-bound RagC/RRAGC forms a complex with GTP-bound RagA/RRAGA (or RagB/RRAGB) and in an inactive form when GTP-bound RagC/RRAGC heterodimerizes with GDP-bound RagA/RRAGA (or RagB/RRAGB) (PubMed:24095279, PubMed:31601708, PubMed:31601764, PubMed:32868926). In its GDP-bound active form, promotes the recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomes and its subsequent activation by the GTPase RHEB (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279, PubMed:27234373, PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36697823). This is a crucial step in the activation of the MTOR signaling cascade by amino acids (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279, PubMed:27234373). Also plays a central role in the non-canonical mTORC1 complex, which acts independently of RHEB and specifically mediates phosphorylation of MiT/TFE factors TFEB and TFE3: GDP-bound RagC/RRAGC mediates recruitment of MiT/TFE factors TFEB and TFE3 (PubMed:32612235, PubMed:36697823).
