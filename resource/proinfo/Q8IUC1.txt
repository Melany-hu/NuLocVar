UniprotID	Q8IUC1
Accession	Q8IUC1;A1L4I8
EntryName	KR111_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 11-1 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 11.1)
GeneName	KRTAP11-1 KAP11.1 KRTAP11.1
Length	163
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
