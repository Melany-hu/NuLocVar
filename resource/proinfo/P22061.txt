EntryName	PIMT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein-L-isoaspartate(D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase (PIMT) (EC 2.1.1.77) (L-isoaspartyl protein carboxyl methyltransferase) (Protein L-isoaspartyl/D-aspartyl methyltransferase) (Protein-beta-aspartate methyltransferase)
GeneName	PCMT1
Length	227
Function	Initiates the repair of damaged proteins by catalyzing methyl esterification of L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl residues produced by spontaneous isomerization and racemization of L-aspartyl and L-asparaginyl residues in aging peptides and proteins (PubMed:3167043, PubMed:6469980). Acts on EIF4EBP2, microtubule-associated protein 2, calreticulin, clathrin light chains a and b, Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1, stathmin, beta-synuclein and alpha-synuclein (By similarity).
