EntryName	CERS6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6) (LAG1 longevity assurance homolog 6) (Sphingoid base N-palmitoyltransferase CERS6) (EC 2.3.1.291)
GeneName	CERS6 LASS6
Length	384
Function	Ceramide synthase that catalyzes the transfer of the acyl chain from acyl-CoA to a sphingoid base, with high selectivity toward palmitoyl-CoA (hexadecanoyl-CoA; C16:0-CoA) (PubMed:17609214, PubMed:17977534, PubMed:23530041, PubMed:26887952, PubMed:31916624). Can use other acyl donors, but with less efficiency (By similarity). N-acylates sphinganine and sphingosine bases to form dihydroceramides and ceramides in de novo synthesis and salvage pathways, respectively (PubMed:17977534, PubMed:23530041, PubMed:26887952, PubMed:31916624). Ceramides generated by CERS6 play a role in inflammatory response (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of metabolism and hepatic lipid accumulation (By similarity). Under high fat diet, palmitoyl- (C16:0-) ceramides generated by CERS6 specifically bind the mitochondrial fission factor MFF, thereby promoting mitochondrial fragmentation and contributing to the development of obesity (By similarity).
