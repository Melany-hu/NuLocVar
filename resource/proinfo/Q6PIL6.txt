EntryName	KCIP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kv channel-interacting protein 4 (KChIP4) (A-type potassium channel modulatory protein 4) (Calsenilin-like protein) (Potassium channel-interacting protein 4)
GeneName	KCNIP4 CALP KCHIP4
Length	250
Function	Regulatory subunit of Kv4/D (Shal)-type voltage-gated rapidly inactivating A-type potassium channels. Modulates KCND2 channel density, inactivation kinetics and rate of recovery from inactivation in a calcium-dependent and isoform-specific manner (PubMed:11847232, PubMed:18957440, PubMed:23576435). Modulates KCND3/Kv4.3 currents (PubMed:23576435). Isoform 4 does not increase KCND2 expression at the cell membrane (PubMed:18957440). Isoform 4 retains KCND3 in the endoplasmic reticulum and negatively regulates its expression at the cell membrane.
