UniprotID	O15444
Accession	O15444;A1L4J4;A6NI52;A8K9E7;B5MCA5;Q96KJ7
EntryName	CCL25_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 25 (Chemokine TECK) (Small-inducible cytokine A25) (Thymus-expressed chemokine)
GeneName	CCL25 SCYA25 TECK
Length	150
Function	Potentially involved in T-cell development. Recombinant protein shows chemotactic activity on thymocytes, macrophages, THP-1 cells, and dendritics cells but is inactive on peripheral blood lymphocytes and neutrophils. Binds to CCR9. Isoform 2 is an antagonist of isoform 1. Binds to atypical chemokine receptor ACKR4 and mediates the recruitment of beta-arrestin (ARRB1/2) to ACKR4.
