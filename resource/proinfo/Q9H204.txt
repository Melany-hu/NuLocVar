UniprotID	Q9H204
Accession	Q9H204;Q9BZJ5
EntryName	MED28_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 28 (Endothelial-derived protein 1) (Mediator complex subunit 28) (Merlin and Grb2-interacting cytoskeletal protein) (Magicin) (Tumor angiogenesis marker EG-1)
GeneName	MED28 EG1 FKSG20
Length	178
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors. May be part of a complex containing NF2/merlin that participates in cellular signaling to the actin cytoskeleton downstream of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways.
