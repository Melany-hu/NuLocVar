UniprotID	Q9BRT9
Accession	Q9BRT9;B2R8H5;D3DSY0;Q8N648
EntryName	SLD5_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA replication complex GINS protein SLD5 (GINS complex subunit 4) [Cleaved into: DNA replication complex GINS protein SLD5, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	GINS4 SLD5
Length	223
Function	Required for correct functioning of the GINS complex, a complex that plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication, and progression of DNA replication forks (PubMed:17417653, PubMed:28414293). GINS complex is a core component of CDC45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase, the molecular machine that unwinds template DNA during replication, and around which the replisome is built (PubMed:32453425, PubMed:34694004, PubMed:34700328, PubMed:35585232).
