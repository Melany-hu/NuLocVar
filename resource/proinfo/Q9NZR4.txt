EntryName	VSX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Visual system homeobox 1 (Homeodomain protein RINX) (Retinal inner nuclear layer homeobox protein) (Transcription factor VSX1)
GeneName	VSX1 RINX
Length	365
Function	Binds to the 37-bp core of the locus control region (LCR) of the red/green visual pigment gene cluster (PubMed:10903837). May regulate the activity of the LCR and the cone opsin genes at earlier stages of development (PubMed:10903837). Dispensable in early retinal development (By similarity).
