UniprotID	A6NIX2
Accession	A6NIX2
EntryName	WTIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Wilms tumor protein 1-interacting protein (WT1-interacting protein)
GeneName	WTIP
Length	430
Function	Adapter or scaffold protein which participates in the assembly of numerous protein complexes and is involved in several cellular processes such as cell fate determination, cytoskeletal organization, repression of gene transcription, cell-cell adhesion, cell differentiation, proliferation and migration. Positively regulates microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing. Negatively regulates Hippo signaling pathway and antagonizes phosphorylation of YAP1. Acts as a transcriptional corepressor for SNAI1 and SNAI2/SLUG-dependent repression of E-cadherin transcription. Acts as a hypoxic regulator by bridging an association between the prolyl hydroxylases and VHL enabling efficient degradation of HIF1A. In podocytes, may play a role in the regulation of actin dynamics and/or foot process cytoarchitecture (By similarity). In the course of podocyte injury, shuttles into the nucleus and acts as a transcription regulator that represses WT1-dependent transcription regulation, thereby translating changes in slit diaphragm structure into altered gene expression and a less differentiated phenotype. Involved in the organization of the basal body (By similarity). Involved in cilia growth and positioning (By similarity).
