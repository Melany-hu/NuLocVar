UniprotID	Q8NG06
Accession	Q8NG06;Q6B0H9
EntryName	TRI58_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM58 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Protein BIA2) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase TRIM58) (Tripartite motif-containing protein 58)
GeneName	TRIM58
Length	486
Function	E3 ubiquitin ligase induced during late erythropoiesis. Directly binds and ubiquitinates the intermediate chain of the microtubule motor dynein (DYNC1LI1/DYNC1LI2), stimulating the degradation of the dynein holoprotein complex. May participate in the erythroblast enucleation process through regulation of nuclear polarization.
