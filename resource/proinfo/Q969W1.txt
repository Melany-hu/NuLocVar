Accession	Q969W1;D3DR52;D3DR53;D3DR54;Q5JTG7;Q5JTH0;Q8N4Z6;Q8WY84;Q9BSV3
EntryName	ZDH16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC16 (EC 2.3.1.225) (Abl-philin 2) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 16) (DHHC-16)
GeneName	ZDHHC16 APH2 UNQ2570/PRO6258
Length	377
Function	Palmitoyl acyltransferase that mediates palmitoylation of proteins such as PLN and ZDHHC6 (PubMed:28826475). Required during embryonic heart development and cardiac function, possibly by mediating palmitoylation of PLN, thereby affecting PLN phosphorylation and homooligomerization (By similarity). Also required for eye development (By similarity). Palmitoylates ZDHHC6, affecting the quaternary assembly of ZDHHC6, its localization, stability and function (PubMed:28826475). May play a role in DNA damage response (By similarity). May be involved in apoptosis regulation (By similarity). Involved in the proliferation of neural stem cells by regulating the FGF/ERK pathway (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
