UniprotID	O14894
Accession	O14894;Q17RW9;Q6IB79
EntryName	T4S5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane 4 L6 family member 5 (Tetraspan transmembrane protein L6H)
GeneName	TM4SF5
Length	197
Function	Acts as a lysosomal membrane arginine sensor (PubMed:30956113). Forms a complex with MTOR and SLC38A9 on lysosomal membranes in an arginine-regulated manner, leading to arginine efflux which enables the activation of mTORC1 which subsequently leads to RPS6KB1 and EIF4EBP1 phosphorylations (PubMed:30956113). Facilitates cell cycle G1/S phase progression and the translocation of the CDK4-CCND1 complex into the nucleus (PubMed:20399237). CDKN1B and RHOA/ROCK signaling activity are involved in TM4SF5-mediated acceleration of G1/S phase progression (PubMed:20399237).
