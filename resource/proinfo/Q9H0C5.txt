UniprotID	Q9H0C5
Accession	Q9H0C5;A6NMI8;Q9BX71;Q9NWN4
EntryName	BTBD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	BTB/POZ domain-containing protein 1 (Hepatitis C virus NS5A-transactivated protein 8) (HCV NS5A-transactivated protein 8)
GeneName	BTBD1 C15orf1 NS5ATP8
Length	482
Function	Probable substrate-specific adapter of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:14528312). Seems to regulate expression levels and/or subnuclear distribution of TOP1, via an unknown mechanism (By similarity). May play a role in mesenchymal differentiation where it promotes myogenic differentiation and suppresses adipogenesis (By similarity).
