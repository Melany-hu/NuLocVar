UniprotID	Q9H2K0
Accession	Q9H2K0;Q05BL8;Q5W0V0;Q86X68
EntryName	IF3M_HUMAN
ProteinName	Translation initiation factor IF-3, mitochondrial (IF-3(Mt)) (IF-3Mt) (IF3(mt)) (IF3mt)
GeneName	MTIF3 DC38
Length	278
Function	IF-3 binds to the 28S ribosomal subunit and shifts the equilibrium between 55S ribosomes and their 39S and 28S subunits in favor of the free subunits, thus enhancing the availability of 28S subunits on which protein synthesis initiation begins.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
