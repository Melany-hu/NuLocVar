EntryName	UBP46_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 46 (EC 3.4.19.12) (Deubiquitinating enzyme 46) (Ubiquitin thioesterase 46) (Ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 46)
GeneName	USP46
Length	366
Function	Deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a role in behavior, possibly by regulating GABA action. May act by mediating the deubiquitination of GAD1/GAD67 (By similarity). Has almost no deubiquitinating activity by itself and requires the interaction with WDR48 to have a high activity (PubMed:19075014, PubMed:26388029). Not involved in deubiquitination of monoubiquitinated FANCD2 (PubMed:19075014).
