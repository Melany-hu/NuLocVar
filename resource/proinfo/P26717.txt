UniprotID	P26717
Accession	P26717;O43802;Q52M74;Q9NR42
EntryName	NKG2C_HUMAN
ProteinName	NKG2-C type II integral membrane protein (CD159 antigen-like family member C) (NK cell receptor C) (NKG2-C-activating NK receptor) (CD antigen CD159c)
GeneName	KLRC2 NKG2C
Length	231
Function	Immune activating receptor involved in self-nonself discrimination. In complex with KLRD1 on cytotoxic lymphocyte subsets, recognizes non-classical major histocompatibility (MHC) class Ib HLA-E loaded with signal sequence-derived peptides from non-classical MHC class Ib HLA-G molecules, likely playing a role in the generation and effector functions of adaptive natural killer (NK) cells and in maternal-fetal tolerance during pregnancy (PubMed:30134159, PubMed:37264229, PubMed:9754572). Regulates the effector functions of terminally differentiated cytotoxic lymphocyte subsets, and in particular may play a role in adaptive NK cell response to viral infection (PubMed:20952657, PubMed:21825173). Upon HLA-E-peptide binding, transmits intracellular signals via the adapter protein TYROBP/DAP12, triggering the phosphorylation of proximal signaling molecules and cell activation (PubMed:15940674, PubMed:9655483).
