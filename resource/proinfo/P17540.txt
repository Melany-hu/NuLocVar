UniprotID	P17540
Accession	P17540;Q6ICS8;Q8N1E1
EntryName	KCRS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Creatine kinase S-type, mitochondrial (EC 2.7.3.2) (Basic-type mitochondrial creatine kinase) (Mib-CK) (Sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase) (S-MtCK)
GeneName	CKMT2
Length	419
Function	Reversibly catalyzes the transfer of phosphate between ATP and various phosphogens (e.g. creatine phosphate). Creatine kinase isoenzymes play a central role in energy transduction in tissues with large, fluctuating energy demands, such as skeletal muscle, heart, brain and spermatozoa.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
