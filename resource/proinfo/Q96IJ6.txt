EntryName	GMPPA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase regulatory subunit alpha (GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase A) (GMPP-alpha) (GTP-mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase alpha)
GeneName	GMPPA
Length	420
Function	Regulatory subunit of the GMPPA-GMPPB mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase complex; reduces the catalytic activity of GMPPB when part of the complex (PubMed:24035193, PubMed:33986552). Mediates allosteric feedback inhibition of GMPPB catalytic activity upon binding GDP-alpha-D-mannose (PubMed:24035193, PubMed:33986552). Together with GMPPB regulates GDP-alpha-D-mannose levels (PubMed:33986552).
