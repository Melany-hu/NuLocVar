EntryName	TRAF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (EC 2.3.2.27) (CD40 receptor-associated factor 1) (CRAF1) (CD40-binding protein) (CD40BP) (LMP1-associated protein 1) (LAP1) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase TRAF3)
GeneName	TRAF3 CAP-1 CRAF1 TRAFAMN
Length	568
Function	Cytoplasmic E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates various signaling pathways, such as the NF-kappa-B, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) pathways, and thus controls a lot of biological processes in both immune and non-immune cell types (PubMed:33148796, PubMed:33608556). In TLR and RLR signaling pathways, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase promoting the synthesis of 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains on several substrates such as ASC that lead to the activation of the type I interferon response or the inflammasome (PubMed:25847972, PubMed:27980081). Following the activation of certain TLRs such as TLR4, acts as a negative NF-kappa-B regulator, possibly to avoid unregulated inflammatory response, and its degradation via 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination is required for MAPK activation and production of inflammatory cytokines. Alternatively, when TLR4 orchestrates bacterial expulsion, TRAF3 undergoes 'Lys-33'-linked polyubiquitination and subsequently binds to RALGDS, mobilizing the exocyst complex to rapidly expel intracellular bacteria back for clearance (PubMed:27438768). Also acts as a constitutive negative regulator of the alternative NF-kappa-B pathway, which controls B-cell survival and lymphoid organ development. Required for normal antibody isotype switching from IgM to IgG. Plays a role T-cell dependent immune responses. Down-regulates proteolytic processing of NFKB2, and thereby inhibits non-canonical activation of NF-kappa-B. Promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MAP3K14.
