UniprotID	Q8NFJ6
Accession	Q8NFJ6;A5JUU1;Q2M3C0;Q5TDY1;Q9NTT0
EntryName	PKR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prokineticin receptor 2 (PK-R2) (G-protein coupled receptor 73-like 1) (G-protein coupled receptor I5E) (GPR73b) (GPRg2)
GeneName	PROKR2 GPR73L1 PKR2
Length	384
Function	Receptor for prokineticin 2. Exclusively coupled to the G(q) subclass of heteromeric G proteins. Activation leads to mobilization of calcium, stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover and activation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
