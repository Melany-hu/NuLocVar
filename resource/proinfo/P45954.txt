EntryName	ACDSB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Short/branched chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, mitochondrial (SBCAD) (EC 1.3.8.5) (2-methyl branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) (2-MEBCAD) (2-methylbutyryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase) (2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase)
GeneName	ACADSB
Length	432
Function	Short and branched chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase that catalyzes the removal of one hydrogen from C-2 and C-3 of the fatty acyl-CoA thioester, resulting in the formation of trans-2-enoyl-CoA (PubMed:10832746, PubMed:11013134, PubMed:21430231, PubMed:7698750). Among the different mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, acts specifically on short and branched chain acyl-CoA derivatives such as (S)-2-methylbutyryl-CoA as well as short straight chain acyl-CoAs such as butyryl-CoA (PubMed:10832746, PubMed:11013134, PubMed:21430231, PubMed:7698750). Plays an important role in the metabolism of L-isoleucine by catalyzing the dehydrogenation of 2-methylbutyryl-CoA, one of the steps of the L-isoleucine catabolic pathway (PubMed:10832746, PubMed:11013134). Can also act on valproyl-CoA, a metabolite of valproic acid, an antiepileptic drug (PubMed:8660691).
