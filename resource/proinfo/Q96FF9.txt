UniprotID	Q96FF9
Accession	Q96FF9;A8K625
EntryName	CDCA5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sororin (Cell division cycle-associated protein 5) (p35)
GeneName	CDCA5
Length	252
Function	Regulator of sister chromatid cohesion in mitosis stabilizing cohesin complex association with chromatin. May antagonize the action of WAPL which stimulates cohesin dissociation from chromatin. Cohesion ensures that chromosome partitioning is accurate in both meiotic and mitotic cells and plays an important role in DNA repair. Required for efficient DNA double-stranded break repair.
