UniprotID	Q8NCW0
Accession	Q8NCW0;B4DXF6;I3L2S2;Q8N2J4;Q8NCW1;Q96GL8;Q9BTP9
EntryName	KREM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kremen protein 2 (Dickkopf receptor 2) (Kringle domain-containing transmembrane protein 2) (Kringle-containing protein marking the eye and the nose)
GeneName	KREMEN2 KRM2
Length	462
Function	Receptor for Dickkopf proteins. Cooperates with DKK1/2 to inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by promoting the endocytosis of Wnt receptors LRP5 and LRP6. Plays a role in limb development; attenuates Wnt signaling in the developing limb to allow normal limb patterning and can also negatively regulate bone formation.
