UniprotID	P78330
Accession	P78330;B2RCR5;Q7Z3S5
EntryName	SERB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP) (PSPase) (EC 3.1.3.3) (L-3-phosphoserine phosphatase) (O-phosphoserine phosphohydrolase)
GeneName	PSPH
Length	225
Function	Catalyzes the last irreversible step in the biosynthesis of L-serine from carbohydrates, the dephosphorylation of O-phospho-L-serine to L-serine (PubMed:12213811, PubMed:14673469, PubMed:15291819, PubMed:25080166, PubMed:9222972). L-serine can then be used in protein synthesis, to produce other amino acids, in nucleotide metabolism or in glutathione synthesis, or can be racemized to D-serine, a neuromodulator (PubMed:14673469). May also act on O-phospho-D-serine (Probable).
