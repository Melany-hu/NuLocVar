UniprotID	Q86V24
Accession	Q86V24;Q53YY5;Q9H737
EntryName	PAQR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adiponectin receptor protein 2 (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 2) (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member II)
GeneName	ADIPOR2 PAQR2
Length	386
Function	Receptor for ADIPOQ, an essential hormone secreted by adipocytes that regulates glucose and lipid metabolism (PubMed:12802337, PubMed:25855295). Required for normal body fat and glucose homeostasis. ADIPOQ-binding activates a signaling cascade that leads to increased PPARA activity, and ultimately to increased fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake. Has intermediate affinity for globular and full-length adiponectin. Required for normal revascularization after chronic ischemia caused by severing of blood vessels (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
