EntryName	S22A5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Organic cation/carnitine transporter 2 (High-affinity sodium-dependent carnitine cotransporter) (Solute carrier family 22 member 5)
GeneName	SLC22A5 OCTN2
Length	557
Function	Sodium-ion dependent, high affinity carnitine transporter. Involved in the active cellular uptake of carnitine. Transports one sodium ion with one molecule of carnitine (PubMed:10454528, PubMed:10525100, PubMed:10966938, PubMed:17509700, PubMed:20722056, PubMed:33124720). Also transports organic cations such as tetraethylammonium (TEA) without the involvement of sodium. Relative uptake activity ratio of carnitine to TEA is 11.3 (PubMed:10454528, PubMed:10525100, PubMed:10966938). In intestinal epithelia, transports the quorum-sensing pentapeptide CSF (competence and sporulation factor) from B.subtilis which induces cytoprotective heat shock proteins contributing to intestinal homeostasis (PubMed:18005709). May also contribute to regulate the transport of organic compounds in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable).
