UniprotID	Q9Y5Y4
Accession	Q9Y5Y4;O94765;Q4QRI6
EntryName	PD2R2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (Chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells) (G-protein coupled receptor 44) (CD antigen CD294)
GeneName	PTGDR2 CRTH2 DL1R GPR44
Length	395
Function	Receptor for prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). Coupled to the G(i)-protein. Receptor activation may result in pertussis toxin-sensitive decreases in cAMP levels and Ca(2+) mobilization. PI3K signaling is also implicated in mediating PTGDR2 effects. PGD2 induced receptor internalization. CRTH2 internalization can be regulated by diverse kinases such as, PKC, PKA, GRK2, GPRK5/GRK5 and GRK6. Receptor activation is responsible, at least in part, in immune regulation and allergic/inflammation responses.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
