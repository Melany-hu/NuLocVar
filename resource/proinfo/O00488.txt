UniprotID	O00488
Accession	O00488;B2R4S0;Q5T2H7
EntryName	ZN593_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein 593 (Zinc finger protein T86)
GeneName	ZNF593 ZT86
Length	134
Function	Involved in pre-60S ribosomal particles maturation by promoting the nuclear export of the 60S ribosome (PubMed:32669547). Negatively modulates the DNA binding activity of Oct-2 and therefore its transcriptional regulatory activity (PubMed:9115366).
