EntryName	STX1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Syntaxin-1A (Neuron-specific antigen HPC-1)
GeneName	STX1A STX1
Length	288
Function	Plays an essential role in hormone and neurotransmitter calcium-dependent exocytosis and endocytosis (PubMed:26635000). Part of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Receptor) complex composed of SNAP25, STX1A and VAMP2 which mediates the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. STX1A and SNAP25 are localized on the plasma membrane while VAMP2 resides in synaptic vesicles. The pairing of the three SNAREs from the N-terminal SNARE motifs to the C-terminal anchors leads to the formation of the SNARE complex, which brings membranes into close proximity and results in final fusion. Participates in the calcium-dependent regulation of acrosomal exocytosis in sperm (PubMed:23091057). Also plays an important role in the exocytosis of hormones such as insulin or glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) (By similarity).
