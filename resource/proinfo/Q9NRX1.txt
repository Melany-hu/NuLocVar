UniprotID	Q9NRX1
Accession	Q9NRX1;A8K6Q0;Q53G13;Q8WVB8
EntryName	PNO1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA-binding protein PNO1 (Partner of NOB1)
GeneName	PNO1
Length	252
Function	Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797). Positively regulates dimethylation of two adjacent adenosines in the loop of a conserved hairpin near the 3'-end of 18S rRNA (PubMed:25851604).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleolus
