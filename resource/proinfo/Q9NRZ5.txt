UniprotID	Q9NRZ5
Accession	Q9NRZ5;B4DSF9;Q5TEF0
EntryName	PLCD_HUMAN
ProteinName	1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase delta (EC 2.3.1.51) (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 4) (1-AGP acyltransferase 4) (1-AGPAT 4) (Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase delta) (LPAAT-delta)
GeneName	AGPAT4 UNQ499/PRO1016
Length	378
Function	Converts 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid or LPA) into 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (phosphatidic acid or PA) by incorporating an acyl moiety at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone (By similarity). Exhibits high acyl-CoA specificity for polyunsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, especially docosahexaenoyl-CoA (22:6-CoA, DHA-CoA) (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
