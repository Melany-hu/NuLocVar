UniprotID	O00451
Accession	O00451;E9PD47;O15316;O15328;Q58J92;Q6GTR9;Q7Z5C2
EntryName	GFRA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	GDNF family receptor alpha-2 (GDNF receptor alpha-2) (GDNFR-alpha-2) (GFR-alpha-2) (GDNF receptor beta) (GDNFR-beta) (Neurturin receptor alpha) (NRTNR-alpha) (NTNR-alpha) (RET ligand 2) (TGF-beta-related neurotrophic factor receptor 2)
GeneName	GFRA2 GDNFRB RETL2 TRNR2
Length	464
Function	Receptor for neurturin (NRTN), a growth factor that supports the survival of sympathetic neurons (PubMed:10829012, PubMed:29414779, PubMed:31535977, PubMed:9182803). NRTN-binding leads to autophosphorylation and activation of the RET receptor (PubMed:31535977). Also able to mediate GDNF signaling through the RET tyrosine kinase receptor (PubMed:9182803).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
