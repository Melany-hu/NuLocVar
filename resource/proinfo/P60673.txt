UniprotID	P60673
Accession	P60673;A2RUL3
EntryName	PROF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Profilin-3 (Profilin III)
GeneName	PFN3
Length	137
Function	Binds to actin and affects the structure of the cytoskeleton. Slightly reduces actin polymerization. Binds to poly-L-proline, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P). May be involved in spermatogenesis.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Nucleus
