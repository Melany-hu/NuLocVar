UniprotID	Q9BXD5
Accession	Q9BXD5;B2R839;Q4G0Q8;Q4G0Z2;Q64L88;Q6PEL0
EntryName	NPL_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acetylneuraminate lyase (NALase) (EC 4.1.3.3) (N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase) (N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase) (Sialate lyase) (Sialate-pyruvate lyase) (Sialic acid aldolase) (Sialic acid lyase)
GeneName	NPL C1orf13
Length	320
Function	Catalyzes the cleavage of N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) to form pyruvate and N-acetylmannosamine via a Schiff base intermediate (PubMed:33895133). It prevents sialic acids from being recycled and returning to the cell surface (PubMed:33895133). Involved in the N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) degradation pathway (PubMed:22692205, PubMed:33895133). Although human is not able to catalyze formation of Neu5Gc due to the inactive CMAHP enzyme, Neu5Gc is present in food and must be degraded (Probable).
