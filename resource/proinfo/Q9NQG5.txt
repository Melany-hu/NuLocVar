UniprotID	Q9NQG5
Accession	Q9NQG5;Q1WDE7;Q6PKF4
EntryName	RPR1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulation of nuclear pre-mRNA domain-containing protein 1B (Cell cycle-related and expression-elevated protein in tumor)
GeneName	RPRD1B C20orf77 CREPT
Length	326
Function	Interacts with phosphorylated C-terminal heptapeptide repeat domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2A, and participates in dephosphorylation of the CTD by RPAP2. Transcriptional regulator which enhances expression of CCND1. Promotes binding of RNA polymerase II to the CCDN1 promoter and to the termination region before the poly-A site but decreases its binding after the poly-A site. Prevents RNA polymerase II from reading through the 3' end termination site and may allow it to be recruited back to the promoter through promotion of the formation of a chromatin loop. Also enhances the transcription of a number of other cell cycle-related genes including CDK2, CDK4, CDK6 and cyclin-E but not CDKN1A, CDKN1B or cyclin-A. Promotes cell proliferation.
