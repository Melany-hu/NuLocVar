EntryName	ARMT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Damage-control phosphatase ARMT1 (EC 3.1.3.-) (Acidic residue methyltransferase 1) (Protein-glutamate O-methyltransferase) (EC 2.1.1.-) (Sugar phosphate phosphatase ARMT1)
GeneName	ARMT1 C6orf211
Length	441
Function	Metal-dependent phosphatase that shows phosphatase activity against several substrates, including fructose-1-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate (By similarity). Its preference for fructose-1-phosphate, a strong glycating agent that causes DNA damage rather than a canonical yeast metabolite, suggests a damage-control function in hexose phosphate metabolism (By similarity). Has also been shown to have O-methyltransferase activity that methylates glutamate residues of target proteins to form gamma-glutamyl methyl ester residues (PubMed:25732820). Possibly methylates PCNA, suggesting it is involved in the DNA damage response (PubMed:25732820).
