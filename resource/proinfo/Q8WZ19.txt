UniprotID	Q8WZ19
Accession	Q8WZ19;A8K0R5;Q96P93;Q96SA1
EntryName	BACD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	BTB/POZ domain-containing adapter for CUL3-mediated RhoA degradation protein 1 (hBACURD1) (BTB/POZ domain-containing protein KCTD13) (Polymerase delta-interacting protein 1) (TNFAIP1-like protein)
GeneName	KCTD13 BACURD1 PDIP1 POLDIP1 FKSG86 PP6832
Length	329
Function	Substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex required for synaptic transmission (PubMed:19782033). The BCR(KCTD13) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex mediates the ubiquitination of RHOA, leading to its degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:19782033) Degradation of RHOA regulates the actin cytoskeleton and promotes synaptic transmission (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
