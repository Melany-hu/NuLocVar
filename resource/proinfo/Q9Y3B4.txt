UniprotID	Q9Y3B4
Accession	Q9Y3B4;Q53TM1
EntryName	SF3B6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Splicing factor 3B subunit 6 (Pre-mRNA branch site protein p14) (SF3b 14 kDa subunit) (SF3B14a) (Spliceosome-associated protein, 14-kDa) (Splicing factor 3b, subunit 6, 14kDa)
GeneName	SF3B6 SAP14 SF3B14 SF3B14A CGI-110 HSPC175 HT006
Length	125
Function	Component of the 17S U2 SnRNP complex of the spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex that removes introns from transcribed pre-mRNAs (PubMed:12234937, PubMed:27720643, PubMed:32494006, PubMed:34822310). The 17S U2 SnRNP complex (1) directly participates in early spliceosome assembly and (2) mediates recognition of the intron branch site during pre-mRNA splicing by promoting the selection of the pre-mRNA branch-site adenosine, the nucleophile for the first step of splicing (PubMed:12234937, PubMed:32494006, PubMed:34822310). Within the 17S U2 SnRNP complex, SF3B6 is part of the SF3B subcomplex, which is required for 'A' complex assembly formed by the stable binding of U2 snRNP to the branchpoint sequence in pre-mRNA (PubMed:12234937, PubMed:27720643). Sequence independent binding of SF3A and SF3B subcomplexes upstream of the branch site is essential, it may anchor U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA (PubMed:12234937). Within the 17S U2 SnRNP complex, SF3B6 directly contacts the pre-mRNA branch site adenosine for the first catalytic step of splicing (PubMed:16432215). SF3B6 stabilizes the intron branch site-U2 snRNA duplex, thereby promoting-binding of introns with poor sequence complementarity (PubMed:34822310). Also acts as a component of the minor spliceosome, which is involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (PubMed:15146077, PubMed:33509932).
