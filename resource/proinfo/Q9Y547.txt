UniprotID	Q9Y547
Accession	Q9Y547;A6NG57;D3DQ45;Q9Y684
EntryName	IFT25_HUMAN
ProteinName	Intraflagellar transport protein 25 homolog (Heat shock protein beta-11) (Hspb11) (Heat shock protein family B member 11) (Placental protein 25) (PP25)
GeneName	IFT25 C1orf41 HSPB11 HSPC034
Length	144
Function	Component of the IFT complex B required for sonic hedgehog/SHH signaling. May mediate transport of SHH components: required for the export of SMO and PTCH1 receptors out of the cilium and the accumulation of GLI2 at the ciliary tip in response to activation of the SHH pathway, suggesting it is involved in the dynamic transport of SHH signaling molecules within the cilium. Not required for ciliary assembly. Its role in intraflagellar transport is mainly seen in tissues rich in ciliated cells such as kidney and testis. Essential for male fertility, spermiogenesis and sperm flagella formation. Plays a role in the early development of the kidney. May be involved in the regulation of ureteric bud initiation (By similarity).
