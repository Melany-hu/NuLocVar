UniprotID	Q8TD22
Accession	Q8TD22;A8K116;Q494Y3;Q53T29
EntryName	SFXN5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sideroflexin-5
GeneName	SFXN5
Length	340
Function	Mitochondrial amino-acid transporter (By similarity). Transports citrate (By similarity). Does not act as a serine transporter: not able to mediate transport of serine into mitochondria (By similarity) (PubMed:30442778). In brown adipose tissue, plays a role in the regulation of UCP1-dependent thermogenesis probably by supporting mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate utilization (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
