UniprotID	Q96GM5
Accession	Q96GM5;A6NN27;Q92924;Q9Y635
EntryName	SMRD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily D member 1 (60 kDa BRG-1/Brm-associated factor subunit A) (BRG1-associated factor 60A) (BAF60A) (SWI/SNF complex 60 kDa subunit)
GeneName	SMARCD1 BAF60A
Length	515
Function	Involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology). Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner (PubMed:29374058, PubMed:8804307). Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). Has a strong influence on vitamin D-mediated transcriptional activity from an enhancer vitamin D receptor element (VDRE). May be a link between mammalian SWI-SNF-like chromatin remodeling complexes and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) heterodimer (PubMed:14698202). Mediates critical interactions between nuclear receptors and the BRG1/SMARCA4 chromatin-remodeling complex for transactivation (PubMed:12917342). Interacts with AKIRIN2 (By similarity).
