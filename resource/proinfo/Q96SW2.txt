Function	Substrate recognition component of a DCX (DDB1-CUL4-X-box) E3 protein ligase complex that mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, such as MEIS2, ILF2 or GLUL (PubMed:26990986, PubMed:33009960). Normal degradation of key regulatory proteins is required for normal limb outgrowth and expression of the fibroblast growth factor FGF8 (PubMed:20223979, PubMed:24328678, PubMed:25043012, PubMed:25108355). Maintains presynaptic glutamate release and consequently cognitive functions, such as memory and learning, by negatively regulating large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels in excitatory neurons (PubMed:18414909, PubMed:29530986). Likely to function by regulating the assembly and neuronal surface expression of BK channels via its interaction with KCNT1 (PubMed:18414909). May also be involved in regulating anxiety-like behaviors via a BK channel-independent mechanism (By similarity). Plays a negative role in TLR4 signaling by interacting with TRAF6 and ECSIT, leading to inhibition of ECSIT ubiquitination, an important step of the signaling (PubMed:31620128).
