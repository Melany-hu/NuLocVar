UniprotID	O14595
Accession	O14595;A8K5H4;Q53ZR2;Q6NZY3;Q9UEX1
EntryName	CTDS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carboxy-terminal domain RNA polymerase II polypeptide A small phosphatase 2 (EC 3.1.3.16) (Nuclear LIM interactor-interacting factor 2) (NLI-interacting factor 2) (Protein OS-4) (Small C-terminal domain phosphatase 2) (Small CTD phosphatase 2) (SCP2)
GeneName	CTDSP2 NIF2 OS4 SCP2
Length	271
Function	Preferentially catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 'Ser-5' within the tandem 7 residue repeats in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2A. Negatively regulates RNA polymerase II transcription, possibly by controlling the transition from initiation/capping to processive transcript elongation. Recruited by REST to neuronal genes that contain RE-1 elements, leading to neuronal gene silencing in non-neuronal cells. May contribute to the development of sarcomas.
