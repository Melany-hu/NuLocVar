UniprotID	P03923
Accession	P03923;Q34774;Q8HG30
EntryName	NU6M_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 6 (EC 7.1.1.2) (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6)
GeneName	MT-ND6 MTND6 NADH6 ND6
Length	174
Function	Core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) which catalyzes electron transfer from NADH through the respiratory chain, using ubiquinone as an electron acceptor (PubMed:14595656, PubMed:8644732). Essential for the catalytic activity and assembly of complex I (PubMed:14595656, PubMed:8644732).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
