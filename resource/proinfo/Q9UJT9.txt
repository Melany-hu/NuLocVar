UniprotID	Q9UJT9
Accession	Q9UJT9;B9EGF1;D6RDY7;O94926
EntryName	FBXL7_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-box/LRR-repeat protein 7 (F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 7) (F-box protein FBL6/FBL7)
GeneName	FBXL7 FBL6 FBL7 KIAA0840
Length	491
Function	Substrate recognition component of a SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (PubMed:25778398). During mitosis, it mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of AURKA, causing mitotic arrest (By similarity). It also regulates mitochondrial function by mediating the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the apoptosis inhibitor BIRC5 (PubMed:25778398, PubMed:28218735).
