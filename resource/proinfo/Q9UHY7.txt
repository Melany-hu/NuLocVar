UniprotID	Q9UHY7
Accession	Q9UHY7;Q7Z4C5;Q9BVC2
EntryName	ENOPH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Enolase-phosphatase E1 (EC 3.1.3.77) (2,3-diketo-5-methylthio-1-phosphopentane phosphatase) (MASA homolog)
GeneName	ENOPH1 MASA MSTP145
Length	261
Function	Bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the enolization of 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate (DK-MTP-1-P) into the intermediate 2-hydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentenyl-1-phosphate (HK-MTPenyl-1-P), which is then dephosphorylated to form the acireductone 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-methylthiopentene (DHK-MTPene).
