ProteinName	Purine nucleoside phosphorylase LACC1 (EC 2.4.2.1) (Adenosine deaminase LACC1) (EC 3.5.4.4) (Fatty acid metabolism-immunity nexus) (Guanosine phosphorylase LACC1) (Laccase domain-containing protein 1) (S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphorylase LACC1) (EC 2.4.2.28)
GeneName	LACC1 C13orf31 FAMIN
Length	430
Function	Purine nucleoside enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorolysis of adenosine, guanosine and inosine nucleosides, yielding D-ribose 1-phosphate and the respective free bases, adenine, guanine and hypoxanthine (PubMed:31978345). Also catalyzes the phosphorolysis of S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine into adenine and S-methyl-5-thio-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate (PubMed:31978345). Also has adenosine deaminase activity (PubMed:31978345). Acts as a regulator of innate immunity in macrophages by modulating the purine nucleotide metabolism, thereby regulating the metabolic function and bioenergetic state of macrophages (PubMed:31978345). Enables a purine nucleotide cycle between adenosine and inosine monophosphate and adenylosuccinate that prevents cytoplasmic acidification and balances the cytoplasmic-mitochondrial redox interface (PubMed:31978345). The purine nucleotide cycle consumes aspartate and releases fumarate in a manner involving fatty acid oxidation and ATP-citrate lyase activity (PubMed:31978345). Participates in pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced cytokines in macrophages: associates with the NOD2-signaling complex and promotes optimal NOD2-induced signaling, cytokine secretion and bacterial clearance (PubMed:28593945, PubMed:31875558). Localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum upon PRR stimulation of macrophages and associates with endoplasmic reticulum-stress sensors, promoting the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) (PubMed:31875558). Does not show laccase activity (PubMed:27959965, PubMed:31978345).
