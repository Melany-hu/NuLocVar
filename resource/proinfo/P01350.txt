UniprotID	P01350
Accession	P01350;P78463;P78464
EntryName	GAST_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gastrin [Cleaved into: Gastrin-71 (Gastrin component I); Gastrin-52 (G52); Big gastrin (Gastrin component II) (Gastrin-34) (G34); Gastrin (Gastrin component III) (Gastrin-17) (G17); Gastrin-14 (G14); Gastrin-6 (G6)]
GeneName	GAST GAS
Length	101
Function	Gastrin stimulates the stomach mucosa to produce and secrete hydrochloric acid and the pancreas to secrete its digestive enzymes. It also stimulates smooth muscle contraction and increases blood circulation and water secretion in the stomach and intestine.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
