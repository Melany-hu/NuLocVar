Accession	Q9NRQ2;A8K2E9;Q2TTR3;Q658L3;Q6ZR73;Q7Z505
EntryName	PLS4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholipid scramblase 4 (PL scramblase 4) (Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid scramblase 4) (Cell growth-inhibiting gene 43 protein) (TRA1)
GeneName	PLSCR4 GIG43
Length	329
Function	Catalyzes metal ion-induced ATP-independent rapid bidirectional and non-specific movement of phospholipids (lipid scrambling or lipid flip-flop) between the inner and outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and participates in the redistribution of phospholipids between membrane leaflets (PubMed:23089641). Metal ions bind to the calcium-binding site and induce conformation change in the protein (PubMed:23089641). Has a greater affi nity for Ca(2+) than Mg(2+) and Zn(2+) (PubMed:23089641).
