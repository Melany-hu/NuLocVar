UniprotID	Q96B45
Accession	Q96B45;B2R488;B3KUW4;C9K0X3
EntryName	BORC7_HUMAN
ProteinName	BLOC-1-related complex subunit 7 (Diaskedin)
GeneName	BORCS7 C10orf32
Length	106
Function	As part of the BORC complex may play a role in lysosomes movement and localization at the cell periphery. Associated with the cytosolic face of lysosomes, the BORC complex may recruit ARL8B and couple lysosomes to microtubule plus-end-directed kinesin motor.
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane
