UniprotID	P04085
Accession	P04085;B5BU73
EntryName	PDGFA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Platelet-derived growth factor subunit A (PDGF subunit A) (PDGF-1) (Platelet-derived growth factor A chain) (Platelet-derived growth factor alpha polypeptide)
GeneName	PDGFA PDGF1
Length	211
Function	Growth factor that plays an essential role in the regulation of embryonic development, cell proliferation, cell migration, survival and chemotaxis. Potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin. Required for normal lung alveolar septum formation during embryogenesis, normal development of the gastrointestinal tract, normal development of Leydig cells and spermatogenesis. Required for normal oligodendrocyte development and normal myelination in the spinal cord and cerebellum. Plays an important role in wound healing. Signaling is modulated by the formation of heterodimers with PDGFB (By similarity).
