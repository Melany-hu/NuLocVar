ProteinName	CMP-N-acetylneuraminate-beta-galactosamide-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 2 (Alpha 2,3-ST 2) (Beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 2) (EC 2.4.3.4) (Gal-NAc6S) (Gal-beta-1,3-GalNAc-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase) (Monosialoganglioside sialyltransferase) (EC 2.4.3.2) (ST3Gal II) (ST3GalII) (ST3GalA.2) (Sialyltransferase 4B) (SIAT4-B)
GeneName	ST3GAL2 SIAT4B
Length	350
Function	A beta-galactoside alpha2-3 sialyltransferase primarily involved in terminal sialylation of ganglio and globo series glycolipids (PubMed:8920913, PubMed:9266697). Catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid (N-acetyl-neuraminic acid; Neu5Ac) from the nucleotide sugar donor CMP-Neu5Ac onto acceptor Galbeta-(1->3)-GalNAc-terminated glycoconjugates through an alpha2-3 linkage (PubMed:25916169, PubMed:8920913, PubMed:9266697). Sialylates GM1/GM1a, GA1/asialo-GM1 and GD1b gangliosides to form GD1a, GM1b and GT1b, respectively (PubMed:8920913, PubMed:9266697). Together with ST3GAL3, primarily responsible for biosynthesis of brain GD1a and GT1b that function as ligands for myelin-associated glycoprotein MAG on axons, regulating MAG expression and axonal myelin stability and regeneration (By similarity). Via GT1b regulates TLR2 signaling in spinal cord microglia in response to nerve injury (By similarity). Responsible for the sialylation of the pluripotent stem cell- and cancer stem cell-associated antigen SSEA3, forming SSEA4 (PubMed:12716912). Sialylates with low efficiency asialofetuin, presumably onto O-glycosidically linked Galbeta-(1->3)-GalNAc-O-Ser (PubMed:25916169, PubMed:9266697).
