UniprotID	Q13564
Accession	Q13564;A6NCK0;A6NFN4;A8MU28;B2R700;B3KUP9
EntryName	ULA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 regulatory subunit (Amyloid beta precursor protein-binding protein 1, 59 kDa) (APP-BP1) (Amyloid protein-binding protein 1) (Proto-oncogene protein 1)
GeneName	NAE1 APPBP1 HPP1
Length	534
Function	Regulatory subunit of the dimeric UBA3-NAE1 E1 enzyme. E1 activates NEDD8 by first adenylating its C-terminal glycine residue with ATP, thereafter linking this residue to the side chain of the catalytic cysteine, yielding a NEDD8-UBA3 thioester and free AMP. E1 finally transfers NEDD8 to the catalytic cysteine of UBE2M. Necessary for cell cycle progression through the S-M checkpoint. Overexpression of NAE1 causes apoptosis through deregulation of NEDD8 conjugation. The covalent attachment of NEDD8 to target proteins is known as 'neddylation' and the process is involved in the regulation of cell growth, viability and development.
