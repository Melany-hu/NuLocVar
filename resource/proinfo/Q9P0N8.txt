EntryName	MARH2_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MARCHF2 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Membrane-associated RING finger protein 2) (Membrane-associated RING-CH protein II) (MARCH-II) (RING finger protein 172) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase MARCHF2)
GeneName	MARCHF2 MARCH2 RNF172 HSPC240
Length	246
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that may mediate ubiquitination of TFRC and CD86, and promote their subsequent endocytosis and sorting to lysosomes via multivesicular bodies. E3 ubiquitin ligases accept ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester and then directly transfer the ubiquitin to targeted substrates (PubMed:14722266, PubMed:16428329). Together with GOPC/CAL mediates the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of CFTR (PubMed:23818989). Ubiquitinates and therefore mediates the degradation of DLG1 (PubMed:17980554). Regulates the intracellular trafficking and secretion of alpha1-antitrypsin/SERPINA1 and HP/haptoglobin via ubiquitination and degradation of the cargo receptor ERGIC3 (PubMed:31142615). Negatively regulates the antiviral and antibacterial immune response by repression of the NF-kB and type 1 IFN signaling pathways, via MARCHF2-mediated K48-linked polyubiquitination of IKBKG/NEMO, resulting in its proteasomal degradation (PubMed:32935379). May be involved in endosomal trafficking through interaction with STX6 (PubMed:15689499).
