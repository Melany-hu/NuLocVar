ProteinName	Putative mitochondrial transporter UCP3 (Solute carrier family 25 member 9) (Uncoupling protein-3) (UCP 3)
GeneName	UCP3 SLC25A9
Length	312
Function	Putative transmembrane transporter that plays a role in mitochondrial metabolism via an as yet unclear mechanism (PubMed:21775425, PubMed:36114012). Originally, this mitochondrial protein was thought to act as a proton transmembrane transporter from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the matrix, causing proton leaks through the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby uncoupling mitochondrial membrane potential generation from ATP synthesis (PubMed:11171965, PubMed:12670931, PubMed:12734183, PubMed:9305858). However, this function is controversial and uncoupling may not be the function, or at least not the main function, but rather a consequence of more conventional metabolite transporter activity (PubMed:11707458).
