UniprotID	P13945
Accession	P13945;Q4JFT4
EntryName	ADRB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-3 adrenergic receptor (Beta-3 adrenoreceptor) (Beta-3 adrenoceptor)
GeneName	ADRB3 ADRB3R B3AR
Length	408
Function	Beta-adrenergic receptors mediate the catecholamine-induced activation of adenylate cyclase through the action of G proteins. Beta-3 is involved in the regulation of lipolysis and thermogenesis.
