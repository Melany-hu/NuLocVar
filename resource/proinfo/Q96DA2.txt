UniprotID	Q96DA2
Accession	Q96DA2;Q5JT79;Q8NEX3
EntryName	RB39B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-39B
GeneName	RAB39B
Length	213
Function	Small GTPases Rab involved in autophagy (PubMed:27103069). The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (PubMed:27103069). May regulate the homeostasis of SNCA/alpha-synuclein. Together with PICK1 proposed to ensure selectively GRIA2 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and to regulate AMPAR compostion at the post-synapses and thus synaptic transmission (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Golgi apparatus
