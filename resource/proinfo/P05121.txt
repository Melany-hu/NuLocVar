EntryName	PAI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI) (PAI-1) (Endothelial plasminogen activator inhibitor) (Serpin E1)
GeneName	SERPINE1 PAI1 PLANH1
Length	402
Function	Serine protease inhibitor. Inhibits TMPRSS7 (PubMed:15853774). Is a primary inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (PLAT) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU). As PLAT inhibitor, it is required for fibrinolysis down-regulation and is responsible for the controlled degradation of blood clots (PubMed:17912461, PubMed:8481516, PubMed:9207454, PubMed:21925150). As PLAU inhibitor, it is involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and spreading (PubMed:9175705). Acts as a regulator of cell migration, independently of its role as protease inhibitor (PubMed:15001579, PubMed:9168821). It is required for stimulation of keratinocyte migration during cutaneous injury repair (PubMed:18386027). It is involved in cellular and replicative senescence (PubMed:16862142). Plays a role in alveolar type 2 cells senescence in the lung (By similarity). Is involved in the regulation of cementogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells, and regulates odontoblast differentiation and dentin formation during odontogenesis (PubMed:25808697, PubMed:27046084).
