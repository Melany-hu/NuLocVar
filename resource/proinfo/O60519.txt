UniprotID	O60519
Accession	O60519;B5BUM5
EntryName	CRBL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-like 2
GeneName	CREBL2
Length	120
Function	Probable regulator of CREB1 transcriptional activity which is involved in adipose cells differentiation. May also play a regulatory role in the cell cycle. Identification in a chromosomal region frequently deleted in various cancers suggests that it might act as a tumor suppressor.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
