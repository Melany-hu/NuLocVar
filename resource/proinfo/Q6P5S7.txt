UniprotID	Q6P5S7
Accession	Q6P5S7;G3V1Z9;Q502Z2
EntryName	RNK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease kappa (RNase K) (RNase kappa) (EC 3.1.-.-) (V-type proton ATPase subunit f) (V-ATPase subunit f)
GeneName	RNASEK
Length	137
Function	Endoribonuclease which preferentially cleaves ApU and ApG phosphodiester bonds. Hydrolyzes UpU bonds at a lower rate (PubMed:17881363). Regulates the activity of vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) which is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments (PubMed:26212330). Required at an early stage of receptor-mediated endocytosis (PubMed:26212330).
Subcellular Location	Endomembrane system; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane
