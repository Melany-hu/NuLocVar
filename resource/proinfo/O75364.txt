UniprotID	O75364
Accession	O75364;Q5VZL2
EntryName	PITX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pituitary homeobox 3 (Homeobox protein PITX3) (Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 3)
GeneName	PITX3 PTX3
Length	302
Function	Transcriptional regulator which is important for the differentiation and maintenance of meso-diencephalic dopaminergic (mdDA) neurons during development. In addition to its importance during development, it also has roles in the long-term survival and maintenance of the mdDA neurons. Activates NR4A2/NURR1-mediated transcription of genes such as SLC6A3, SLC18A2, TH and DRD2 which are essential for development of mdDA neurons. Acts by decreasing the interaction of NR4A2/NURR1 with the corepressor NCOR2/SMRT which acts through histone deacetylases (HDACs) to keep promoters of NR4A2/NURR1 target genes in a repressed deacetylated state. Essential for the normal lens development and differentiation. Plays a critical role in the maintenance of mitotic activity of lens epithelial cells, fiber cell differentiation and in the control of the temporal and spatial activation of fiber cell-specific crystallins. Positively regulates FOXE3 expression and negatively regulates PROX1 in the anterior lens epithelium, preventing activation of CDKN1B/P27Kip1 and CDKN1C/P57Kip2 and thus maintains lens epithelial cells in cell cycle (By similarity).
