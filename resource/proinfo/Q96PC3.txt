UniprotID	Q96PC3
Accession	Q96PC3;B4DQZ1;Q8WTY1;Q96DD1
EntryName	AP1S3_HUMAN
ProteinName	AP-1 complex subunit sigma-3 (Adaptor protein complex AP-1 subunit sigma-1C) (Adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit sigma-1C) (Clathrin assembly protein complex 1 sigma-1C small chain) (Golgi adaptor HA1/AP1 adaptin sigma-1C subunit) (Sigma 1C subunit of AP-1 clathrin) (Sigma-adaptin 1C) (Sigma1C-adaptin)
GeneName	AP1S3
Length	154
Function	Subunit of clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1 that plays a role in protein sorting in the late-Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN) and/or endosomes. The AP complexes mediate both the recruitment of clathrin to membranes and the recognition of sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. Involved in TLR3 trafficking (PubMed:24791904).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Membrane; Clathrin-coated pit
