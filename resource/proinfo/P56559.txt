UniprotID	P56559
Accession	P56559;Q4A519;Q53R10;Q9BVN1;Q9UQ34
EntryName	ARL4C_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 4C (ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 7) (ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein LAK)
GeneName	ARL4C ARL7
Length	192
Function	Small GTP-binding protein which cycles between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound form, and the rate of cycling is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAP). GTP-binding protein that does not act as an allosteric activator of the cholera toxin catalytic subunit. May be involved in transport between a perinuclear compartment and the plasma membrane, apparently linked to the ABCA1-mediated cholesterol secretion pathway. Recruits CYTH1, CYTH2, CYTH3 and CYTH4 to the plasma membrane in the GDP-bound form. Regulates the microtubule-dependent intracellular vesicular transport from early endosome to recycling endosome process.
Subcellular Location	Cell projection; Filopodium; Cell membrane; Cytoplasm
