EntryName	CIR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Corepressor interacting with RBPJ 1 (CBF1-interacting corepressor) (Recepin)
GeneName	CIR1 CIR
Length	450
Function	May modulate splice site selection during alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs (By similarity). Regulates transcription and acts as corepressor for RBPJ. Recruits RBPJ to the Sin3-histone deacetylase complex (HDAC). Required for RBPJ-mediated repression of transcription.
