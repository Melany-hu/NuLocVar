UniprotID	O60844
Accession	O60844;B2R4Z3;B9EK72
EntryName	ZG16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zymogen granule membrane protein 16 (Zymogen granule protein 16) (hZG16) (Secretory lectin ZG16)
GeneName	ZG16
Length	167
Function	May play a role in protein trafficking. May act as a linker molecule between the submembranous matrix on the luminal side of zymogen granule membrane (ZGM) and aggregated secretory proteins during granule formation in the TGN.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Extracellular space; Extracellular matrix; Zymogen granule lumen; Golgi apparatus lumen
