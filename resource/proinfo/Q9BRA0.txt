UniprotID	Q9BRA0
Accession	Q9BRA0;Q8N4M0
EntryName	NAA38_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-alpha-acetyltransferase 38, NatC auxiliary subunit (LSM domain-containing protein 1) (Phosphonoformate immuno-associated protein 2)
GeneName	NAA38 LSMD1 MAK31 PFAAP2
Length	125
Function	Auxillary component of the N-terminal acetyltransferase C (NatC) complex which catalyzes acetylation of N-terminal methionine residues (PubMed:19398576, PubMed:37891180). N-terminal acetylation protects proteins from ubiquitination and degradation by the N-end rule pathway (PubMed:37891180).
