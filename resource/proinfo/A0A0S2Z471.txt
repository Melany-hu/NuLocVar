UniprotID	A0A0S2Z471
Accession	A0A0S2Z471
EntryName	A0A0S2Z471_HUMAN
ProteinName	Creatine kinase B-type (EC 2.7.3.2) (Creatine kinase B chain)
GeneName	CKB hCG_25499
Length	405
Function	Reversibly catalyzes the transfer of phosphate between ATP and various phosphogens (e.g. creatine phosphate). Creatine kinase isoenzymes play a central role in energy transduction in tissues with large, fluctuating energy demands, such as skeletal muscle, heart, brain and spermatozoa. Acts as a key regulator of adaptive thermogenesis as part of the futile creatine cycle: localizes to the mitochondria of thermogenic fat cells and acts by mediating phosphorylation of creatine to initiate a futile cycle of creatine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. During the futile creatine cycle, creatine and N-phosphocreatine are in a futile cycle, which dissipates the high energy charge of N-phosphocreatine as heat without performing any mechanical or chemical work.
