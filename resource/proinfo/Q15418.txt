EntryName	KS6A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-1 (S6K-alpha-1) (EC 2.7.11.1) (90 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1) (p90-RSK 1) (p90RSK1) (p90S6K) (MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 1a) (MAPK-activated protein kinase 1a) (MAPKAP kinase 1a) (MAPKAPK-1a) (Ribosomal S6 kinase 1) (RSK-1)
GeneName	RPS6KA1 MAPKAPK1A RSK1
Length	735
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase that acts downstream of ERK (MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1) signaling and mediates mitogenic and stress-induced activation of the transcription factors CREB1, ETV1/ER81 and NR4A1/NUR77, regulates translation through RPS6 and EIF4B phosphorylation, and mediates cellular proliferation, survival, and differentiation by modulating mTOR signaling and repressing pro-apoptotic function of BAD and DAPK1 (PubMed:10679322, PubMed:12213813, PubMed:15117958, PubMed:16223362, PubMed:17360704, PubMed:18722121, PubMed:26158630, PubMed:35772404, PubMed:9430688). In fibroblast, is required for EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of CREB1, which results in the subsequent transcriptional activation of several immediate-early genes (PubMed:18508509, PubMed:18813292). In response to mitogenic stimulation (EGF and PMA), phosphorylates and activates NR4A1/NUR77 and ETV1/ER81 transcription factors and the cofactor CREBBP (PubMed:12213813, PubMed:16223362). Upon insulin-derived signal, acts indirectly on the transcription regulation of several genes by phosphorylating GSK3B at 'Ser-9' and inhibiting its activity (PubMed:18508509, PubMed:18813292). Phosphorylates RPS6 in response to serum or EGF via an mTOR-independent mechanism and promotes translation initiation by facilitating assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PubMed:17360704). In response to insulin, phosphorylates EIF4B, enhancing EIF4B affinity for the EIF3 complex and stimulating cap-dependent translation (PubMed:16763566). Is involved in the mTOR nutrient-sensing pathway by directly phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-1798', which potently inhibits TSC2 ability to suppress mTOR signaling, and mediates phosphorylation of RPTOR, which regulates mTORC1 activity and may promote rapamycin-sensitive signaling independently of the PI3K/AKT pathway (PubMed:15342917). Also involved in feedback regulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by phosphorylating DEPTOR (PubMed:22017876). Mediates cell survival by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic proteins BAD and DAPK1 and suppressing their pro-apoptotic function (PubMed:10679322, PubMed:16213824). Promotes the survival of hepatic stellate cells by phosphorylating CEBPB in response to the hepatotoxin carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) (PubMed:11684016). Mediates induction of hepatocyte prolifration by TGFA through phosphorylation of CEBPB (PubMed:18508509, PubMed:18813292). Is involved in cell cycle regulation by phosphorylating the CDK inhibitor CDKN1B, which promotes CDKN1B association with 14-3-3 proteins and prevents its translocation to the nucleus and inhibition of G1 progression (PubMed:18508509, PubMed:18813292). Phosphorylates EPHA2 at 'Ser-897', the RPS6KA-EPHA2 signaling pathway controls cell migration (PubMed:26158630). In response to mTORC1 activation, phosphorylates EIF4B at 'Ser-406' and 'Ser-422' which stimulates bicarbonate cotransporter SLC4A7 mRNA translation, increasing SLC4A7 protein abundance and function (PubMed:35772404).
