UniprotID	P03886
Accession	P03886;C0JKH6;Q37523
EntryName	NU1M_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1 (EC 7.1.1.2) (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1)
GeneName	MT-ND1 MTND1 NADH1 ND1
Length	318
Function	Core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) which catalyzes electron transfer from NADH through the respiratory chain, using ubiquinone as an electron acceptor (PubMed:1959619). Essential for the catalytic activity and assembly of complex I (PubMed:1959619, PubMed:26929434).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
