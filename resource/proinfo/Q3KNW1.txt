UniprotID	Q3KNW1
Accession	Q3KNW1;Q86SU5
EntryName	SNAI3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein SNAI3 (Protein snail homolog 3) (Zinc finger protein 293)
GeneName	SNAI3 ZNF293
Length	292
Function	Seems to inhibit myoblast differentiation. Transcriptional repressor of E-box-dependent transactivation of downstream myogenic bHLHs genes. Binds preferentially to the canonical E-box sequences 5'-CAGGTG-3' and 5'-CACCTG-3' (By similarity).
