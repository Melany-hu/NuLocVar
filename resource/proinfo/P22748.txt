UniprotID	P22748
Accession	P22748;B4DQA4;Q6FHI7
EntryName	CAH4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carbonic anhydrase 4 (EC 4.2.1.1) (Carbonate dehydratase IV) (Carbonic anhydrase IV) (CA-IV)
GeneName	CA4
Length	312
Function	Catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide into bicarbonate and protons and thus is essential to maintaining intracellular and extracellular pH (PubMed:15563508, PubMed:16686544, PubMed:16807956, PubMed:17127057, PubMed:17314045, PubMed:17652713, PubMed:17705204, PubMed:18618712, PubMed:19186056, PubMed:19206230, PubMed:7625839). May stimulate the sodium/bicarbonate transporter activity of SLC4A4 that acts in pH homeostasis (PubMed:15563508). It is essential for acid overload removal from the retina and retina epithelium, and acid release in the choriocapillaris in the choroid (PubMed:15563508).
