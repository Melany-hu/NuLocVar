UniprotID	Q86W42

EntryName	THOC6_HUMAN
ProteinName	THO complex subunit 6 (Functional spliceosome-associated protein 35) (fSAP35) (WD repeat-containing protein 58)
GeneName	THOC6 WDR58 PSEC0006
Length	341
Function	Component of the THO subcomplex of the TREX complex which is thought to couple mRNA transcription, processing and nuclear export, and which specifically associates with spliced mRNA and not with unspliced pre-mRNA (PubMed:15833825, PubMed:15998806, PubMed:17190602). Plays a key structural role in the oligomerization of the THO-DDX39B complex (PubMed:33191911). TREX is recruited to spliced mRNAs by a transcription-independent mechanism, binds to mRNA upstream of the exon-junction complex (EJC) and is recruited in a splicing- and cap-dependent manner to a region near the 5' end of the mRNA where it functions in mRNA export to the cytoplasm via the TAP/NXF1 pathway (PubMed:15998806, PubMed:17190602). Plays a role in apoptosis negative control involved in brain development (PubMed:15833825, PubMed:23621916).
