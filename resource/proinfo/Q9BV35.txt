EntryName	SCMC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial adenyl nucleotide antiporter SLC25A23 (Mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi carrier protein 2) (Short calcium-binding mitochondrial carrier protein 3) (SCaMC-3) (Solute carrier family 25 member 23)
GeneName	SLC25A23 APC2 MCSC2 SCAMC3
Length	468
Function	Electroneutral antiporter that mediates the transport of adenine nucleotides through the inner mitochondrial membrane. Originally identified as an ATP-magnesium/inorganic phosphate antiporter, it also acts as a broad specificity adenyl nucleotide antiporter. By regulating the mitochondrial matrix adenine nucleotide pool could adapt to changing cellular energetic demands and indirectly regulate adenine nucleotide-dependent metabolic pathways (PubMed:15123600). Also acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake and can probably transport trace amounts of other divalent metal cations in complex with ATP (PubMed:24430870, PubMed:28695448). In vitro, a low activity is also observed with guanyl and pyrimidine nucleotides (PubMed:15123600).
