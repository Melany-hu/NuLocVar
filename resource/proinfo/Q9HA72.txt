UniprotID	Q9HA72
Accession	Q9HA72;D3DR94;O95893;Q6ZUV9
EntryName	CAHM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium homeostasis modulator protein 2 (Protein FAM26B)
GeneName	CALHM2 FAM26B
Length	323
Function	Pore-forming subunit of Ca(2+) homeostasis modulator channels. Mediates ATP release from astrocytes and ATP-induced Ca(2+) influx in microglia thus regulating neuronal ATP and Ca(2+) homeostasis, synaptic transmission and neuroinflammatory response. May form intercellular gap junctions. The gating mechanism remains unknown.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
