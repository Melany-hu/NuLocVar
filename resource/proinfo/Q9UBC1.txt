EntryName	IKBL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	NF-kappa-B inhibitor-like protein 1 (Inhibitor of kappa B-like protein) (I-kappa-B-like protein) (IkappaBL) (Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor-like 1)
GeneName	NFKBIL1 IKBL
Length	381
Function	Involved in the regulation of innate immune response. Acts as negative regulator of Toll-like receptor and interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) signaling pathways. Contributes to the negative regulation of transcriptional activation of NF-kappa-B target genes in response to endogenous proinflammatory stimuli.
