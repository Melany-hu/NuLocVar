UniprotID	Q7Z7J7
Accession	Q7Z7J7;A6NH76;Q29RV7
EntryName	LHPL4_HUMAN
ProteinName	LHFPL tetraspan subfamily member 4 protein (GABAA receptor regulatory Lhfpl4) (Lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 4 protein)
GeneName	LHFPL4 GARLH4
Length	247
Function	Plays a role in the regulation of inhibitory synapse formation and function by being involved in maintening gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs) clustering and their associated scaffold proteins at inhibitory synaptic sites. Acts in concert with NLGN2 to recruit or stabilize GABAARs.
Subcellular Location	Cell projection; Dendrite; Postsynaptic cell membrane
