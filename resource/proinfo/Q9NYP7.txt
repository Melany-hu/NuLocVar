EntryName	ELOV5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Very long chain fatty acid elongase 5 (EC 2.3.1.199) (3-keto acyl-CoA synthase ELOVL5) (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 5) (ELOVL FA elongase 5) (Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 5) (Fatty acid elongase 1) (hELO1) (Very long chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 5) (Very long chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA synthase 5)
GeneName	ELOVL5 ELOVL2 PRO0530
Length	299
Function	Catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction of the four reactions that constitute the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle. This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process allows the addition of 2 carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) per cycle. Condensing enzyme that acts specifically toward polyunsaturated acyl-CoA with the higher activity toward C18:3(n-6) acyl-CoA. May participate in the production of monounsaturated and of polyunsaturated VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators (By similarity) (PubMed:10970790, PubMed:20937905). In conditions where the essential linoleic and alpha linoleic fatty acids are lacking it is also involved in the synthesis of Mead acid from oleic acid (By similarity).
