UniprotID	P35232
Accession	P35232;B4DY47;Q4VBQ0
EntryName	PHB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prohibitin 1
GeneName	PHB1 PHB
Length	272
Function	Protein with pleiotropic attributes mediated in a cell-compartment- and tissue-specific manner, which include the plasma membrane-associated cell signaling functions, mitochondrial chaperone, and transcriptional co-regulator of transcription factors in the nucleus (PubMed:11302691, PubMed:20959514, PubMed:28017329, PubMed:31522117). Plays a role in adipose tissue and glucose homeostasis in a sex-specific manner (By similarity). Contributes to pulmonary vascular remodeling by accelerating proliferation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cell membrane
