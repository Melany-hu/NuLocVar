UniprotID	O00264
Accession	O00264;B7Z1L3;Q9UGJ9
EntryName	PGRC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Membrane-associated progesterone receptor component 1 (mPR) (Dap1) (IZA)
GeneName	PGRMC1 HPR6.6 PGRMC
Length	195
Function	Component of a progesterone-binding protein complex (PubMed:28396637). Binds progesterone (PubMed:25675345). Has many reported cellular functions (heme homeostasis, interaction with CYPs). Required for the maintenance of uterine histoarchitecture and normal female reproductive lifespan (By similarity). Intracellular heme chaperone. Regulates heme synthesis via interactions with FECH and acts as a heme donor for at least some hemoproteins (PubMed:27599036). Forms a ternary complex with TMEM97 receptor and low density lipid receptor/LDLR, which increases LDLR-mediated LDL lipoprotein internalization (PubMed:30443021).
