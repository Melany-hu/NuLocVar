EntryName	GLRA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycine receptor subunit alpha-2
GeneName	GLRA2
Length	452
Function	Subunit of heteromeric glycine-gated chloride channels (PubMed:15302677, PubMed:16144831, PubMed:2155780, PubMed:23895467, PubMed:25445488, PubMed:26370147, PubMed:34473954). Plays a role in synaptic plasticity (By similarity). Contributes to the generation of inhibitory postsynaptic currents, and is involved in the down-regulation of neuronal excitability (PubMed:25445488). Plays a role in cellular responses to ethanol (PubMed:23895467).
