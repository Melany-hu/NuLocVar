UniprotID	Q7Z3H4
Accession	Q7Z3H4
EntryName	SAMD7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 7 (SAM domain-containing protein 7)
GeneName	SAMD7
Length	446
Function	Component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, essential for establishing rod photoreceptor cell identity and function by silencing nonrod gene expression in developing rod photoreceptor cells. Via its association with the PRC1-like complex, promotes epigenetic repressive marks H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub marks in nonrod genes, silencing their transcription. Represses Crx-controlled photoreceptor-specific gene expression.
