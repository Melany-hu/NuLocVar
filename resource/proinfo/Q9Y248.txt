UniprotID	Q9Y248
Accession	Q9Y248;D3DUM5;Q6IAG9
EntryName	PSF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA replication complex GINS protein PSF2 (GINS complex subunit 2)
GeneName	GINS2 PSF2 CGI-122 DC5 HSPC037
Length	185
Function	Required for correct functioning of the GINS complex, a complex that plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication, and progression of DNA replication forks (PubMed:17417653). GINS complex is a core component of CDC45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase, the molecular machine that unwinds template DNA during replication, and around which the replisome is built (PubMed:32453425, PubMed:34694004, PubMed:34700328, PubMed:35585232).
