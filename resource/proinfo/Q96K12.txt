EntryName	FACR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fatty acyl-CoA reductase 2 (FAR2) (EC 1.2.1.84) (Male sterility domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	FAR2 MLSTD1
Length	515
Function	Catalyzes the reduction of saturated but not unsaturated C16 or C18 fatty acyl-CoA to fatty alcohols (FAls) (PubMed:15220348). A lower activity can be observed with shorter fatty acyl-CoA substrates (PubMed:15220348). Can produce very long-chain and ultra long-chain FAls, regardless of whether they have a straight or branched chain (PubMed:35238077). Involved in the production of ether lipids/plasmalogens and wax monoesters whose synthesis requires FAls as substrates (PubMed:24108123, PubMed:35238077).
