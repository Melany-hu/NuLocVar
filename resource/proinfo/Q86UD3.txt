UniprotID	Q86UD3
Accession	Q86UD3;A8K264;B9EJE7
EntryName	MARH3_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MARCHF3 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Membrane-associated RING finger protein 3) (Membrane-associated RING-CH protein III) (MARCH-III) (RING finger protein 173) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase MARCHF3)
GeneName	MARCHF3 MARCH3 RNF173
Length	253
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which may be involved in endosomal trafficking. E3 ubiquitin ligases accept ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester and then directly transfer the ubiquitin to targeted substrates.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Early endosome membrane
Disorder	0.3948,0.3460,0.2817,0.3529,0.3983,0.2034,0.2364,0.2575,0.2783,0.2752,0.2715,0.3087,0.2609,0.2094,0.2094,0.2094,0.3087,0.3249,0.3426,0.2503,0.2224,0.2034,0.1852,0.1942,0.1759,0.1671,0.3249,0.3494,0.3566,0.2817,0.2609,0.2715,0.2503,0.2541,0.2951,0.2817,0.2783,0.3356,0.3215,0.3149,0.4087,0.3426,0.3426,0.4119,0.4087,0.3494,0.3494,0.3494,0.2575,0.2328,0.3149,0.3667,0.3740,0.3948,0.3356,0.3460,0.3774,0.3774,0.3910,0.3667,0.2193,0.2783,0.2680,0.1424,0.1349,0.1881,0.2364,0.2328,0.2224,0.2951,0.3321,0.3392,0.2609,0.1969,0.1702,0.2918,0.1583,0.1643,0.0749,0.0662,0.0749,0.1759,0.1162,0.1731,0.3117,0.2364,0.2164,0.2129,0.2129,0.1115,0.0662,0.0662,0.0592,0.0494,0.0463,0.0454,0.0364,0.0835,0.0799,0.1759,0.1643,0.0967,0.0405,0.0734,0.0424,0.0188,0.0287,0.0157,0.0157,0.0095,0.0151,0.0165,0.0163,0.0168,0.0287,0.0568,0.0581,0.0719,0.0424,0.0269,0.0281,0.0163,0.0168,0.0356,0.0349,0.0704,0.1501,0.1759,0.2918,0.2849,0.4119,0.4441,0.5098,0.4979,0.4119,0.2988,0.2715,0.2817,0.2258,0.2503,0.1969,0.0985,0.1162,0.0985,0.0581,0.0555,0.0555,0.0320,0.0231,0.0235,0.0157,0.0138,0.0138,0.0088,0.0065,0.0059,0.0064,0.0064,0.0062,0.0062,0.0062,0.0093,0.0148,0.0146,0.0258,0.0218,0.0202,0.0171,0.0269,0.0191,0.0194,0.0263,0.0191,0.0191,0.0218,0.0209,0.0364,0.0356,0.0372,0.0244,0.0244,0.0209,0.0108,0.0115,0.0111,0.0081,0.0089,0.0061,0.0044,0.0045,0.0044,0.0036,0.0038,0.0032,0.0032,0.0031,0.0039,0.0033,0.0042,0.0032,0.0028,0.0033,0.0044,0.0044,0.0044,0.0057,0.0080,0.0119,0.0235,0.0483,0.0294,0.0287,0.0253,0.0160,0.0184,0.0214,0.0398,0.0389,0.0443,0.0494,0.0568,0.1206,0.1070,0.1115,0.2094,0.2328,0.2292,0.1349,0.0676,0.0646,0.0334,0.0506,0.0870,0.0929,0.1583,0.2503,0.2399,0.2258,0.2364,0.3249,0.3182,0.3117,0.2129,0.1942,0.1583,0.1298,0.0888,0.0734,0.1275,0.2164,0.1823,0.3182,0.2988
