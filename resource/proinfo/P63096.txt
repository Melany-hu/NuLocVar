EntryName	GNAI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit alpha-1 (EC 3.6.5.-) (Adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G alpha protein)
GeneName	GNAI1
Length	354
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in numerous signaling cascades (PubMed:18434541, PubMed:33762731, PubMed:34239069, PubMed:35610220, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37935377, PubMed:37963465, PubMed:38552625, PubMed:8774883). The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (PubMed:18434541, PubMed:8774883). Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding (PubMed:18434541, PubMed:8774883). The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal (PubMed:18434541, PubMed:8774883). Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numerous regulatory proteins (PubMed:18434541, PubMed:8774883). Signaling is mediated via effector proteins, such as adenylate cyclase: inhibits adenylate cyclase activity of ADCY1, ADCY5 and ADCY6, leading to decreased intracellular cAMP levels (PubMed:8119955). The inactive GDP-bound form prevents the association of RGS14 with centrosomes and is required for the translocation of RGS14 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Required for normal cytokinesis during mitosis (PubMed:17635935). Required for cortical dynein-dynactin complex recruitment during metaphase (PubMed:22327364).
