UniprotID	P01375
Accession	P01375;O43647;Q9P1Q2;Q9UIV3
EntryName	TNFA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor (Cachectin) (TNF-alpha) (Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 2) (TNF-a) [Cleaved into: Tumor necrosis factor, membrane form (N-terminal fragment) (NTF); Intracellular domain 1 (ICD1); Intracellular domain 2 (ICD2); C-domain 1; C-domain 2; Tumor necrosis factor, soluble form]
GeneName	TNF TNFA TNFSF2
Length	233
Function	Cytokine that binds to TNFRSF1A/TNFR1 and TNFRSF1B/TNFBR. It is mainly secreted by macrophages and can induce cell death of certain tumor cell lines. It is potent pyrogen causing fever by direct action or by stimulation of interleukin-1 secretion and is implicated in the induction of cachexia, Under certain conditions it can stimulate cell proliferation and induce cell differentiation. Impairs regulatory T-cells (Treg) function in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis via FOXP3 dephosphorylation. Up-regulates the expression of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which dephosphorylates the key 'Ser-418' residue of FOXP3, thereby inactivating FOXP3 and rendering Treg cells functionally defective (PubMed:23396208). Key mediator of cell death in the anticancer action of BCG-stimulated neutrophils in combination with DIABLO/SMAC mimetic in the RT4v6 bladder cancer cell line (PubMed:16829952, PubMed:22517918, PubMed:23396208). Induces insulin resistance in adipocytes via inhibition of insulin-induced IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and insulin-induced glucose uptake. Induces GKAP42 protein degradation in adipocytes which is partially responsible for TNF-induced insulin resistance (By similarity). Plays a role in angiogenesis by inducing VEGF production synergistically with IL1B and IL6 (PubMed:12794819). Promotes osteoclastogenesis and therefore mediates bone resorption (By similarity).
