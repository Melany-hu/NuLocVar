UniprotID	P22528
Accession	P22528;B2R5H7;P22529;P22530;Q5T524
EntryName	SPR1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cornifin-B (14.9 kDa pancornulin) (Small proline-rich protein IB) (SPR-IB)
GeneName	SPRR1B
Length	89
Function	Cross-linked envelope protein of keratinocytes. It is a keratinocyte protein that first appears in the cell cytosol, but ultimately becomes cross-linked to membrane proteins by transglutaminase. All that results in the formation of an insoluble envelope beneath the plasma membrane. Can function as both amine donor and acceptor in transglutaminase-mediated cross-linkage.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
