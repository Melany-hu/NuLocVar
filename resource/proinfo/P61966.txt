UniprotID	P61966
Accession	P61966;B2R5D8;P82267;Q00382;Q53YA7;Q9BTN4;Q9UDW9
EntryName	AP1S1_HUMAN
ProteinName	AP-1 complex subunit sigma-1A (Adaptor protein complex AP-1 subunit sigma-1A) (Adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit sigma-1A) (Clathrin assembly protein complex 1 sigma-1A small chain) (Clathrin coat assembly protein AP19) (Golgi adaptor HA1/AP1 adaptin sigma-1A subunit) (HA1 19 kDa subunit) (Sigma 1a subunit of AP-1 clathrin) (Sigma-adaptin 1A) (Sigma1A-adaptin)
GeneName	AP1S1 AP19 CLAPS1
Length	158
Function	Subunit of clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1 that plays a role in protein sorting in the late-Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN) and/or endosomes. The AP complexes mediate both the recruitment of clathrin to membranes and the recognition of sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Membrane; Clathrin-coated pit
