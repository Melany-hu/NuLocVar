UniprotID	Q15653
Accession	Q15653;A8K3F4;Q96BJ7
EntryName	IKBB_HUMAN
ProteinName	NF-kappa-B inhibitor beta (NF-kappa-BIB) (I-kappa-B-beta) (IkB-B) (IkB-beta) (IkappaBbeta) (Thyroid receptor-interacting protein 9) (TR-interacting protein 9) (TRIP-9)
GeneName	NFKBIB IKBB TRIP9
Length	356
Function	Inhibits NF-kappa-B by complexing with and trapping it in the cytoplasm. However, the unphosphorylated form resynthesized after cell stimulation is able to bind NF-kappa-B allowing its transport to the nucleus and protecting it to further NFKBIA-dependent inactivation. Association with inhibitor kappa B-interacting NKIRAS1 and NKIRAS2 prevent its phosphorylation rendering it more resistant to degradation, explaining its slower degradation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus
