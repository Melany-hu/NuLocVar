UniprotID	O15511
Accession	O15511;A6NEC4;Q6PG42
EntryName	ARPC5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 5 (Arp2/3 complex 16 kDa subunit) (p16-ARC)
GeneName	ARPC5 ARC16
Length	151
Function	Component of the Arp2/3 complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates actin polymerization upon stimulation by nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) (PubMed:9230079). The Arp2/3 complex mediates the formation of branched actin networks in the cytoplasm, providing the force for cell motility (PubMed:9230079). In addition to its role in the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, the Arp2/3 complex also promotes actin polymerization in the nucleus, thereby regulating gene transcription and repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:29925947). The Arp2/3 complex promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair in response to DNA damage by promoting nuclear actin polymerization, leading to drive motility of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:29925947).
