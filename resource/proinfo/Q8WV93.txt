UniprotID	Q8WV93
Accession	Q8WV93;Q8N6A3
EntryName	AFG1L_HUMAN
ProteinName	AFG1-like ATPase (Lactation elevated protein 1) (EC 3.6.-.-) (Protein AFG1 homolog)
GeneName	AFG1L AFG1 LACE1
Length	481
Function	Putative mitochondrial ATPase. Plays a role in mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial protein metabolism. Promotes degradation of excess nuclear-encoded complex IV subunits (COX4I1, COX5A and COX6A1) and normal activity of complexes III and IV of the respiratory chain (PubMed:26759378, PubMed:27323408). Mediates mitochondrial translocation of TP53 and its transcription-independent apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress (PubMed:27323408).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion membrane
