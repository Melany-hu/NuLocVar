UniprotID	Q15722
Accession	Q15722;Q13305;Q53XV5;Q92641;Q9BSU5
EntryName	LT4R1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leukotriene B4 receptor 1 (LTB4-R 1) (LTB4-R1) (Chemoattractant receptor-like 1) (G-protein coupled receptor 16) (P2Y purinoceptor 7) (P2Y7)
GeneName	LTB4R BLT BLT1 BLTR CMKRL1 GPR16 P2RY7
Length	352
Function	Receptor for extracellular ATP > UTP and ADP. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. May be the cardiac P2Y receptor involved in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction through modulation of L-type calcium currents. Is a receptor for leukotriene B4, a potent chemoattractant involved in inflammation and immune response.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
