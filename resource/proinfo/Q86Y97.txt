UniprotID	Q86Y97
Accession	Q86Y97;Q8WZ10;Q9BRZ6
EntryName	KMT5C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase KMT5C (Lysine N-methyltransferase 5C) (Lysine-specific methyltransferase 5C) (Suppressor of variegation 4-20 homolog 2) (Su(var)4-20 homolog 2) (Suv4-20h2) ([histone H4]-N-methyl-L-lysine20 N-methyltransferase KMT5B) (EC 2.1.1.362) ([histone H4]-lysine20 N-methyltransferase KMT5B) (EC 2.1.1.361)
GeneName	KMT5C SUV420H2 PP7130
Length	462
Function	Histone methyltransferase that specifically methylates monomethylated 'Lys-20' (H4K20me1) and dimethylated 'Lys-20' (H4K20me2) of histone H4 to produce respectively dimethylated 'Lys-20' (H4K20me2) and trimethylated 'Lys-20' (H4K20me3) and thus regulates transcription and maintenance of genome integrity (PubMed:24396869, PubMed:28114273). In vitro also methylates unmodified 'Lys-20' (H4K20me0) of histone H4 and nucleosomes (PubMed:24396869). H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression. Mainly functions in pericentric heterochromatin regions, thereby playing a central role in the establishment of constitutive heterochromatin in these regions. KMT5C is targeted to histone H3 via its interaction with RB1 family proteins (RB1, RBL1 and RBL2) (By similarity). Facilitates TP53BP1 foci formation upon DNA damage and proficient non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-directed DNA repair by catalyzing the di- and trimethylation of 'Lys-20' of histone H4 (PubMed:28114273). May play a role in class switch reconbination by catalyzing the di- and trimethylation of 'Lys-20' of histone H4 (By similarity).
