UniprotID	A4D1S5
Accession	A4D1S5;A4D1S6;B2RTS6;B5MDR2;Q9UL27
EntryName	RAB19_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-19 (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB19 RAB19B
Length	217
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different set of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion.
