UniprotID	P48443
Accession	P48443;A6NIP1;Q6IBU7
EntryName	RXRG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinoic acid receptor RXR-gamma (Nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group B member 3) (Retinoid X receptor gamma)
GeneName	RXRG NR2B3
Length	463
Function	Receptor for retinoic acid. Retinoic acid receptors bind as heterodimers to their target response elements in response to their ligands, all-trans or 9-cis retinoic acid, and regulate gene expression in various biological processes. The RAR/RXR heterodimers bind to the retinoic acid response elements (RARE) composed of tandem 5'-AGGTCA-3' sites known as DR1-DR5. The high affinity ligand for RXRs is 9-cis retinoic acid (By similarity).
