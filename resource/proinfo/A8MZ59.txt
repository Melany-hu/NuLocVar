UniprotID	A8MZ59
Accession	A8MZ59;A0A1W2PQ33
EntryName	LEUTX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor LEUTX (Leucine-twenty homeobox) (Paired-like homeobox transcription factor LEUTX) (PRD-LIKE homeobox transcription factor LEUTX)
GeneName	LEUTX
Length	198
Function	Paired-like homeobox transcription factor involved in embryogenesis (PubMed:27578796, PubMed:30479355). May act as a regulator of embryo genome activation (PubMed:27578796). Binds to a 36 bp DNA elements containing a 5'-TAATCC-3' sequence motif, referred to as EEA motif (EGA-enriched Alu-motif), present in the promoters of target genes activated in early embryos (PubMed:27578796, PubMed:30479355).
