EntryName	ITCH_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy homolog (Itch) (EC 2.3.2.26) (Atrophin-1-interacting protein 4) (AIP4) (HECT-type E3 ubiquitin transferase Itchy homolog) (NFE2-associated polypeptide 1) (NAPP1)
GeneName	ITCH
Length	903
Function	Acts as an Acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which accepts ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester and then directly transfers the ubiquitin to targeted substrates (PubMed:11046148, PubMed:14602072, PubMed:15051726, PubMed:16387660, PubMed:17028573, PubMed:18718448, PubMed:18718449, PubMed:19116316, PubMed:19592251, PubMed:19881509, PubMed:20068034, PubMed:20392206, PubMed:20491914, PubMed:23146885, PubMed:24790097, PubMed:25631046). Catalyzes 'Lys-29'-, 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin conjugation (PubMed:17028573, PubMed:18718448, PubMed:19131965, PubMed:19881509). Involved in the control of inflammatory signaling pathways (PubMed:19131965). Essential component of a ubiquitin-editing protein complex, comprising also TNFAIP3, TAX1BP1 and RNF11, that ensures the transient nature of inflammatory signaling pathways (PubMed:19131965). Promotes the association of the complex after TNF stimulation (PubMed:19131965). Once the complex is formed, TNFAIP3 deubiquitinates 'Lys-63' polyubiquitin chains on RIPK1 and catalyzes the formation of 'Lys-48'-polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:19131965). This leads to RIPK1 proteasomal degradation and consequently termination of the TNF- or LPS-mediated activation of NFKB1 (PubMed:19131965). Ubiquitinates RIPK2 by 'Lys-63'-linked conjugation and influences NOD2-dependent signal transduction pathways (PubMed:19592251). Regulates the transcriptional activity of several transcription factors, and probably plays an important role in the regulation of immune response (PubMed:18718448, PubMed:20491914). Ubiquitinates NFE2 by 'Lys-63' linkages and is implicated in the control of the development of hematopoietic lineages (PubMed:18718448). Mediates JUN ubiquitination and degradation (By similarity). Mediates JUNB ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:16387660). Critical regulator of type 2 helper T (Th2) cell cytokine production by inducing JUNB ubiquitination and degradation (By similarity). Involved in the negative regulation of MAVS-dependent cellular antiviral responses (PubMed:19881509). Ubiquitinates MAVS through 'Lys-48'-linked conjugation resulting in MAVS proteasomal degradation (PubMed:19881509). Following ligand stimulation, regulates sorting of Wnt receptor FZD4 to the degradative endocytic pathway probably by modulating PI42KA activity (PubMed:23146885). Ubiquitinates PI4K2A and negatively regulates its catalytic activity (PubMed:23146885). Ubiquitinates chemokine receptor CXCR4 and regulates sorting of CXCR4 to the degradative endocytic pathway following ligand stimulation by ubiquitinating endosomal sorting complex required for transport ESCRT-0 components HGS and STAM (PubMed:14602072, PubMed:23146885, PubMed:34927784). Targets DTX1 for lysosomal degradation and controls NOTCH1 degradation, in the absence of ligand, through 'Lys-29'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:17028573, PubMed:18628966, PubMed:23886940). Ubiquitinates SNX9 (PubMed:20491914). Ubiquitinates MAP3K7 through 'Lys-48'-linked conjugation (By similarity). Together with UBR5, involved in the regulation of apoptosis and reactive oxygen species levels through the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TXNIP: catalyzes 'Lys-48'-/'Lys-63'-branched ubiquitination of TXNIP (PubMed:20068034, PubMed:29378950). ITCH synthesizes 'Lys-63'-linked chains, while UBR5 is branching multiple 'Lys-48'-linked chains of substrate initially modified (PubMed:29378950). Mediates the antiapoptotic activity of epidermal growth factor through the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of p15 BID (PubMed:20392206). Ubiquitinates BRAT1 and this ubiquitination is enhanced in the presence of NDFIP1 (PubMed:25631046). Inhibits the replication of influenza A virus (IAV) via ubiquitination of IAV matrix protein 1 (M1) through 'Lys-48'-linked conjugation resulting in M1 proteasomal degradation (PubMed:30328013). Ubiquitinates NEDD9/HEF1, resulting in proteasomal degradation of NEDD9/HEF1 (PubMed:15051726).
