ProteinName	Chronophin (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.74) (Pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase) (PLP phosphatase)
GeneName	PDXP CIN PLP PLPP
Length	296
Function	Functions as a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) phosphatase, which also catalyzes the dephosphorylation of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP), with order of substrate preference PLP > PNP > PMP and therefore plays a role in vitamin B6 metabolism (PubMed:14522954, PubMed:8132548). Also functions as a protein serine phosphatase that specifically dephosphorylates 'Ser-3' in proteins of the actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family like CFL1 and DSTN. Thereby, regulates cofilin-dependent actin cytoskeleton reorganization, being required for normal progress through mitosis and normal cytokinesis. Does not dephosphorylate phosphothreonines in LIMK1. Does not dephosphorylate peptides containing phosphotyrosine (PubMed:15580268).
