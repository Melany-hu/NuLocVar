UniprotID	Q15743
Accession	Q15743;Q13334;Q4VBB4;Q6IX34
EntryName	OGR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ovarian cancer G-protein coupled receptor 1 (OGR-1) (G-protein coupled receptor 68) (GPR12A) (Sphingosylphosphorylcholine receptor)
GeneName	GPR68 OGR1
Length	365
Function	Proton-sensing receptor involved in pH homeostasis. May represents an osteoblastic pH sensor regulating cell-mediated responses to acidosis in bone. Mediates its action by association with G proteins that stimulates inositol phosphate (IP) production or Ca(2+) mobilization. The receptor is almost silent at pH 7.8 but fully activated at pH 6.8. Also functions as a metastasis suppressor gene in prostate cancer (By similarity).
