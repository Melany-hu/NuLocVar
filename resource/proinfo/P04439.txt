EntryName	HLAA_HUMAN
ProteinName	HLA class I histocompatibility antigen, A alpha chain (Human leukocyte antigen A) (HLA-A)
GeneName	HLA-A HLAA
Length	365
Function	Antigen-presenting major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecule. In complex with B2M/beta 2 microglobulin displays primarily viral and tumor-derived peptides on antigen-presenting cells for recognition by alpha-beta T cell receptor (TCR) on HLA-A-restricted CD8-positive T cells, guiding antigen-specific T cell immune response to eliminate infected or transformed cells (PubMed:10449296, PubMed:12138174, PubMed:12393434, PubMed:1402688, PubMed:15893615, PubMed:17189421, PubMed:19543285, PubMed:21498667, PubMed:24192765, PubMed:24395804, PubMed:2456340, PubMed:2784196, PubMed:28250417, PubMed:7504010, PubMed:7694806, PubMed:9862734). May also present self-peptides derived from the signal sequence of secreted or membrane proteins, although T cells specific for these peptides are usually inactivated to prevent autoreactivity (PubMed:25880248, PubMed:7506728, PubMed:7679507). Both the peptide and the MHC molecule are recognized by TCR, the peptide is responsible for the fine specificity of antigen recognition and MHC residues account for the MHC restriction of T cells (PubMed:12796775, PubMed:18275829, PubMed:19542454, PubMed:28250417). Typically presents intracellular peptide antigens of 8 to 13 amino acids that arise from cytosolic proteolysis via IFNG-induced immunoproteasome or via endopeptidase IDE/insulin-degrading enzyme (PubMed:17079320, PubMed:17189421, PubMed:20364150, PubMed:26929325, PubMed:27049119). Can bind different peptides containing allele-specific binding motifs, which are mainly defined by anchor residues at position 2 and 9 (PubMed:7504010, PubMed:9862734).
