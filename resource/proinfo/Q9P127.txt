UniprotID	Q9P127
Accession	Q9P127;B3KSD6
EntryName	LUZP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine zipper protein 4 (Cancer/testis antigen 28) (CT-28) (CT28) (Tumor antigen HOM-TES-85)
GeneName	LUZP4
Length	313
Function	Export adapter involved in mRNA nuclear export in cancer cells. Binds and enhances the RNA-binding activity of the nuclear RNA export factor NXF1. Can restore mRNA export function in cells compromised by loss of mRNA export adapters (PubMed:25662211).
