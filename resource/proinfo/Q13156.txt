UniprotID	Q13156
Accession	Q13156;Q3SY03
EntryName	RFA4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Replication protein A 30 kDa subunit (RP-A p30) (Replication factor A protein 4) (RF-A protein 4)
GeneName	RPA4
Length	261
Function	As part of the alternative replication protein A complex, aRPA, binds single-stranded DNA and probably plays a role in DNA repair. Compared to the RPA2-containing, canonical RPA complex, may not support chromosomal DNA replication and cell cycle progression through S-phase. The aRPA may not promote efficient priming by DNA polymerase alpha but could support DNA polymerase delta synthesis in the presence of PCNA and replication factor C (RFC), the dual incision/excision reaction of nucleotide excision repair and RAD51-dependent strand exchange.
