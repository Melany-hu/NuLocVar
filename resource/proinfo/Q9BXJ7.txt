UniprotID	Q9BXJ7
Accession	Q9BXJ7;Q6UX83
EntryName	AMNLS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein amnionless [Cleaved into: Soluble protein amnionless]
GeneName	AMN UNQ513/PRO1028
Length	453
Function	Membrane-bound component of the endocytic receptor formed by AMN and CUBN (PubMed:14576052, PubMed:29402915, PubMed:30523278). Required for normal CUBN glycosylation and trafficking to the cell surface (PubMed:14576052, PubMed:29402915). The complex formed by AMN and CUBN is required for efficient absorption of vitamin B12 (PubMed:12590260, PubMed:14576052, PubMed:26040326). Required for normal CUBN-mediated protein transport in the kidney (Probable).
