EntryName	TRI13_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM13 (EC 2.3.2.27) (B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia tumor suppressor Leu5) (Leukemia-associated protein 5) (Putative tumor suppressor RFP2) (RING finger protein 77) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase TRIM13) (Ret finger protein 2) (Tripartite motif-containing protein 13)
GeneName	TRIM13 LEU5 RFP2 RNF77
Length	407
Function	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane anchored E3 ligase involved in the retrotranslocation and turnover of membrane and secretory proteins from the ER through a set of processes named ER-associated degradation (ERAD). This process acts on misfolded proteins as well as in the regulated degradation of correctly folded proteins. Enhances ionizing radiation-induced p53/TP53 stability and apoptosis via ubiquitinating MDM2 and AKT1 and decreasing AKT1 kinase activity through MDM2 and AKT1 proteasomal degradation. Regulates ER stress-induced autophagy, and may act as a tumor suppressor (PubMed:22178386). Also plays a role in innate immune response by stimulating NF-kappa-B activity in the TLR2 signaling pathway. Ubiquitinates TRAF6 via the 'Lys-29'-linked polyubiquitination chain resulting in NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:28087809). Participates as well in T-cell receptor-mediated NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:25088585). In the presence of TNF, modulates the IKK complex by regulating IKBKG/NEMO ubiquitination leading to the repression of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:25152375).
