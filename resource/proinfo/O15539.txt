UniprotID	O15539
Accession	O15539;E9PMP5;Q53XA9;Q599J0
EntryName	RGS5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (RGS5)
GeneName	RGS5
Length	181
Function	Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form. Binds to G(i)-alpha and G(o)-alpha, but not to G(s)-alpha (By similarity).
