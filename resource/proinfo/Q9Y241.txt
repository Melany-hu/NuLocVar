UniprotID	Q9Y241
Accession	Q9Y241;Q9UFZ2
EntryName	HIG1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	HIG1 domain family member 1A, mitochondrial (Hypoxia-inducible gene 1 protein) (RCF1 homolog A) (RCF1a)
GeneName	HIGD1A HIG1 HSPC010
Length	93
Function	Proposed subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX, complex IV), which is the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water. May play a role in the assembly of respiratory supercomplexes.
