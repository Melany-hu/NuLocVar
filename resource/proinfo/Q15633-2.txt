EntryName	TRBP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	RISC-loading complex subunit TARBP2 (TAR RNA-binding protein 2) (Trans-activation-responsive RNA-binding protein)
GeneName	TARBP2 TRBP
Length	345
Function	Required for formation of the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC). Component of the RISC loading complex (RLC), also known as the micro-RNA (miRNA) loading complex (miRLC), which is composed of DICER1, AGO2 and TARBP2. Within the RLC/miRLC, DICER1 and TARBP2 are required to process precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) to mature miRNAs and then load them onto AGO2. AGO2 bound to the mature miRNA constitutes the minimal RISC and may subsequently dissociate from DICER1 and TARBP2. May also play a role in the production of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by DICER1 (By similarity) (PubMed:15973356, PubMed:16142218, PubMed:16271387, PubMed:16357216, PubMed:16424907, PubMed:17452327, PubMed:18178619). Binds in vitro to the PRM1 3'-UTR (By similarity). Seems to act as a repressor of translation (By similarity). For some pre-miRNA substrates, may also alter the choice of cleavage site by DICER1 (PubMed:23063653). Negatively regulates IRF7-mediated IFN-beta signaling triggered by viral infection by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRF7 and promoting its 'Lys'-48-linked ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:30927622).
