UniprotID	Q86UW2
Accession	Q86UW2;Q3SYF5
EntryName	OSTB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Organic solute transporter subunit beta (OST-beta) (Solute carrier family 51 subunit beta)
GeneName	SLC51B OSTB
Length	128
Function	Essential component of the Ost-alpha/Ost-beta complex, a heterodimer that acts as the intestinal basolateral transporter responsible for bile acid export from enterocytes into portal blood (PubMed:16317684). Modulates SLC51A glycosylation, membrane trafficking and stability activities (PubMed:16317684). The Ost-alpha/Ost-beta complex efficiently transports the major species of bile acids (taurocholate) (PubMed:16317684). Taurine conjugates are transported more efficiently across the basolateral membrane than glycine-conjugated bile acids (By similarity). Can also transport steroids such as estrone 3-sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate, therefore playing a role in the enterohepatic circulation of sterols (PubMed:16317684). Able to transport eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E2 (By similarity).
