UniprotID	P50219
Accession	P50219;F5H401;Q9Y648
EntryName	MNX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Motor neuron and pancreas homeobox protein 1 (Homeobox protein HB9)
GeneName	MNX1 HLXB9
Length	401
Function	Transcription factor (By similarity). Recognizes and binds to the regulatory elements of target genes, such as visual system homeobox CHX10, negatively modulating transcription (By similarity). Plays a role in establishing motor neuron identity, in concert with LIM domain transcription factor LMO4 (By similarity). Involved in negatively modulating transcription of interneuron genes in motor neurons, acting, at least in part, by blocking regulatory sequence interactions of the ISL1-LHX3 complex (By similarity). Involved in pancreas development and function; may play a role in pancreatic cell fate specification (By similarity).
