UniprotID	Q00688
Accession	Q00688;B2R4Q9;Q14317
EntryName	FKBP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP3 (PPIase FKBP3) (EC 5.2.1.8) (25 kDa FK506-binding protein) (25 kDa FKBP) (FKBP-25) (FK506-binding protein 3) (FKBP-3) (Immunophilin FKBP25) (Rapamycin-selective 25 kDa immunophilin) (Rotamase)
GeneName	FKBP3 FKBP25
Length	224
Function	FK506- and rapamycin-binding proteins (FKBPs) constitute a family of receptors for the two immunosuppressants which inhibit T-cell proliferation by arresting two distinct cytoplasmic signal transmission pathways. PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
