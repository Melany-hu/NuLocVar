EntryName	HNF4A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF-4-alpha) (Nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group A member 1) (Transcription factor 14) (TCF-14) (Transcription factor HNF-4)
GeneName	HNF4A HNF4 NR2A1 TCF14
Length	474
Function	Transcriptional regulator which controls the expression of hepatic genes during the transition of endodermal cells to hepatic progenitor cells, facilitating the recruitment of RNA pol II to the promoters of target genes (PubMed:30597922). Activates the transcription of CYP2C38 (By similarity). Represses the CLOCK-BMAL1 transcriptional activity and is essential for circadian rhythm maintenance and period regulation in the liver and colon cells (PubMed:30530698).
