UniprotID	Q9NP86
Accession	Q9NP86;A0AUY4
EntryName	CABP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium-binding protein 5 (CaBP5)
GeneName	CABP5 CABP3
Length	173
Function	Inhibits calcium-dependent inactivation of L-type calcium channel and shifts voltage dependence of activation to more depolarized membrane potentials (By similarity). Involved in the transmission of light signals (By similarity). May positively regulate neurotransmitter vesicle endocytosis and exocytosis in a salt-dependent manner (By similarity). May play a role in the extension and network organization of neurites (By similarity).
