Length	474
Function	Plays a role in directed cell migration by regulating the activation and subcellular location of RAC1 (PubMed:25074804, PubMed:25925950). Increases the presence of activated RAC1 at the leading edge of migrating cells (PubMed:25074804, PubMed:25925950). Required for normal organization of the cytoskeleton, including the actin cytoskeleton, microtubules and the vimentin intermediate filaments (By similarity). Plays a role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated endosome fission: localizes to endosome membrane tubules and promotes recruitment of TMCC1, leading to recruitment of the endoplasmic reticulum to endosome tubules for fission (PubMed:30220460). Endosome membrane fission of early and late endosomes is essential to separate regions destined for lysosomal degradation from carriers to be recycled to the plasma membrane (PubMed:30220460). Required for normal cell proliferation, cell migration, and normal formation of lamellipodia (By similarity). Required for normal distribution of mitochondria within cells (By similarity).
