Accession	Q6XZB0;G1JSG3;G1JSG4;G1JSG5;G1JSG6;G1JSG7;G1JSG8;G1JSG9
EntryName	LIPI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lipase member I (LIPI) (EC 3.1.1.-) (Cancer/testis antigen 17) (CT17) (LPD lipase) (Membrane-associated phosphatidic acid-selective phospholipase A1-beta) (mPA-PLA1 beta)
GeneName	LIPI LPDL PRED5
Length	460
Function	Hydrolyzes specifically phosphatidic acid (PA) to produce 2-acyl lysophosphatidic acid (LPA; a potent bioactive lipid mediator) and fatty acid. Does not hydrolyze other phospholipids, like phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or triacylglycerol (TG).
