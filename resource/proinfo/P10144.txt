UniprotID	P10144
Accession	P10144;Q8N1D2;Q9UCC1
EntryName	GRAB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Granzyme B (EC 3.4.21.79) (C11) (CTLA-1) (Cathepsin G-like 1) (CTSGL1) (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte proteinase 2) (Lymphocyte protease) (Fragmentin-2) (Granzyme-2) (Human lymphocyte protein) (HLP) (SECT) (T-cell serine protease 1-3E)
GeneName	GZMB CGL1 CSPB CTLA1 GRB
Length	247
Function	Abundant protease in the cytosolic granules of cytotoxic T-cells and NK-cells which activates caspase-independent pyroptosis when delivered into the target cell through the immunological synapse (PubMed:1985927, PubMed:3262682, PubMed:3263427). It cleaves after Asp (PubMed:1985927, PubMed:8258716). Once delivered into the target cell, acts by catalyzing cleavage of gasdermin-E (GSDME), releasing the pore-forming moiety of GSDME, thereby triggering pyroptosis and target cell death (PubMed:31953257, PubMed:32188940). Seems to be linked to an activation cascade of caspases (aspartate-specific cysteine proteases) responsible for apoptosis execution. Cleaves caspase-3, -9 and -10 (CASP3, CASP9 and CASP10, respectively) to give rise to active enzymes mediating apoptosis (PubMed:9852092). Cleaves and activates CASP7 in response to bacterial infection, promoting plasma membrane repair (By similarity).
