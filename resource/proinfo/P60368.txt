UniprotID	P60368
Accession	P60368;Q70LJ5
EntryName	KR102_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 10-2 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.2) (Keratin-associated protein 10.2) (Keratin-associated protein 18-2) (Keratin-associated protein 18.2)
GeneName	KRTAP10-2 KAP10.2 KAP18-2 KRTAP10.2 KRTAP18-2 KRTAP18.2
Length	255
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
