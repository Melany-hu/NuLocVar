UniprotID	Q96HR9
Accession	Q96HR9;A0A1L5BXV3;B2RE01;D6W5Z0;Q96LM0
EntryName	REEP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Receptor expression-enhancing protein 6 (Polyposis locus protein 1-like 1)
GeneName	REEP6 C19orf32 DP1L1
Length	211
Function	Required for correct function and survival of retinal photoreceptors (PubMed:27889058). Required for retinal development (By similarity). In rod photoreceptors, facilitates stability and/or trafficking of guanylate cyclases and is required to maintain endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial homeostasis (By similarity). May play a role in clathrin-coated intracellular vesicle trafficking of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the retinal rod plasma membrane (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane
