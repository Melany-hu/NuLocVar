EntryName	CP1A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 1A2 (EC 1.14.14.1) (CYPIA2) (Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase) (Cytochrome P(3)450) (Cytochrome P450 4) (Cytochrome P450-P3) (Hydroperoxy icosatetraenoate dehydratase) (EC 4.2.1.152)
GeneName	CYP1A2
Length	516
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids, steroid hormones and vitamins (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:9435160). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:9435160). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317). Exhibits high catalytic activity for the formation of hydroxyestrogens from estrone (E1) and 17beta-estradiol (E2), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2 (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317). Metabolizes cholesterol toward 25-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological regulator of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:21576599). May act as a major enzyme for all-trans retinoic acid biosynthesis in the liver. Catalyzes two successive oxidative transformation of all-trans retinol to all-trans retinal and then to the active form all-trans retinoic acid (PubMed:10681376). Primarily catalyzes stereoselective epoxidation of the last double bond of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), displaying a strong preference for the (R,S) stereoisomer (PubMed:19965576). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation and omega-1 hydroxylation of PUFA (PubMed:9435160). May also participate in eicosanoids metabolism by converting hydroperoxide species into oxo metabolites (lipoxygenase-like reaction, NADPH-independent) (PubMed:21068195). Plays a role in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. Catalyzes the N-hydroxylation of heterocyclic amines and the O-deethylation of phenacetin (PubMed:14725854). Metabolizes caffeine via N3-demethylation (Probable).
