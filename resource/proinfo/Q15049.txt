Accession	Q15049;B3KW61;B7Z659;Q5JZ83;Q8TAG4;Q96RP5;Q9UGY8
EntryName	MLC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Membrane protein MLC1 (Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts protein 1)
GeneName	MLC1 KIAA0027 WKL1
Length	377
Function	Transmembrane protein mainly expressed in brain astrocytes that may play a role in transport across the blood-brain and brain-cerebrospinal fluid barriers (PubMed:22328087). Regulates the response of astrocytes to hypo-osmosis by promoting calcium influx (PubMed:22328087). May function as regulatory protein of membrane protein complexes such as ion channels (Probable).
