UniprotID	P38405
Accession	P38405;B7ZA26;Q86XU3
EntryName	GNAL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(olf) subunit alpha (EC 3.6.5.-) (Adenylate cyclase-stimulating G alpha protein, olfactory type)
GeneName	GNAL
Length	381
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) involved as transducer in olfactory signal transduction controlled by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (By similarity). Contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (By similarity). Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding (By similarity). The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal (By similarity). Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numerous regulatory proteins (By similarity). GNAL/G(olf) alpha specifically mediates olfactory signal transduction within the olfactory neuroepithelium and the basal ganglia following GPCRs activation (By similarity). Acts by promoting the specific activation of adenylyl cyclase ADCY3, resulting in increased levels of the signaling molecule cAMP (By similarity).
