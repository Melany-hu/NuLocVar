UniprotID	Q9BU20
Accession	Q9BU20;Q5TEV7
EntryName	CPLN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ciliogenesis and planar polarity effector 2 (REM2- and Rab-like small GTPase 1)
GeneName	CPLANE2 C1orf89 RSG1
Length	258
Function	Required for efficient primary cilia initiation, regulating a late step in cilia initiation. Plays a role in the final maturation of the mother centriole and ciliary vesicle that allows extension of the ciliary axoneme.
