UniprotID	P80297
Accession	P80297;A8MUC7
EntryName	MT1X_HUMAN
ProteinName	Metallothionein-1X (MT-1X) (Metallothionein-IX) (MT-IX)
GeneName	MT1X
Length	61
Function	Metallothioneins have a high content of cysteine residues that bind various heavy metals; these proteins are transcriptionally regulated by both heavy metals and glucocorticoids. May be involved in FAM168A anti-apoptotic signaling (PubMed:23251525).
