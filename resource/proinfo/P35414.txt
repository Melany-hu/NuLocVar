Accession	P35414
EntryName	APJ_HUMAN
ProteinName	Apelin receptor (Angiotensin receptor-like 1) (G-protein coupled receptor APJ) (G-protein coupled receptor HG11)
GeneName	APLNR AGTRL1 APJ
Length	380
Function	G protein-coupled receptor for peptide hormones apelin (APLN) and apelin receptor early endogenous ligand (APELA/ELA), that plays a role in the regulation of normal cardiovascular function and fluid homeostasis (PubMed:11090199, PubMed:22810587, PubMed:25639753, PubMed:28137936, PubMed:35817871, PubMed:38428423). When acting as apelin receptor, activates both G(i) protein pathway that inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, and the beta-arrestin pathway that promotes internalization of the receptor (PubMed:11090199, PubMed:25639753, PubMed:28137936, PubMed:35817871, PubMed:38428423). APLNR/APJ also functions as mechanoreceptor that is activated by pathological stimuli in a G-protein-independent fashion to induce beta-arrestin signaling, hence eliciting cardiac hypertrophy (PubMed:22810587, PubMed:38428423). However, the presence of apelin ligand blunts cardiac hypertrophic induction from APLNR/APJ on response to pathological stimuli (PubMed:22810587, PubMed:38428423). Plays a key role in early development such as gastrulation, blood vessels formation and heart morphogenesis by acting as a APELA receptor (By similarity). May promote angioblast migration toward the embryonic midline, i.e. the position of the future vessel formation, during vasculogenesis (By similarity). Promotes sinus venosus (SV)-derived endothelial cells migration into the developing heart to promote coronary blood vessel development (By similarity). Also plays a role in various processes in adults such as regulation of blood vessel formation, blood pressure, heart contractility and heart failure (PubMed:25639753, PubMed:28137936).
