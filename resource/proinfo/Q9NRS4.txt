UniprotID	Q9NRS4
Accession	Q9NRS4;A8MU84;B0YJB0;B7Z8C5;E7ERX8;Q5XKQ6;Q6UX37;Q9NZA5
EntryName	TMPS4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protease serine 4 (EC 3.4.21.-) (Channel-activating protease 2) (CAPH2) (Membrane-type serine protease 2) (MT-SP2) [Cleaved into: Transmembrane protease serine 4 catalytic chain]
GeneName	TMPRSS4 TMPRSS3 UNQ776/PRO1570
Length	437
Function	Plasma membrane-anchored serine protease that directly induces processing of pro-uPA/PLAU into the active form through proteolytic activity (PubMed:24434139). Seems to be capable of activating ENaC (By similarity).
