UniprotID	P55087
Accession	P55087;P78564
EntryName	AQP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) (Mercurial-insensitive water channel) (MIWC) (WCH4)
GeneName	AQP4
Length	323
Function	Forms a water-specific channel (PubMed:19383790, PubMed:7559426, PubMed:8601457). Plays an important role in brain water homeostasis (PubMed:37143309). It is involved in glymphatic solute transport and is required for a normal rate of water exchange across the blood brain interface. Required for normal levels of cerebrospinal fluid influx into the brain cortex and parenchyma along paravascular spaces that surround penetrating arteries, and for normal drainage of interstitial fluid along paravenous drainage pathways. Thereby, it is required for normal clearance of solutes from the brain interstitial fluid, including soluble beta-amyloid peptides derived from APP. Plays a redundant role in urinary water homeostasis and urinary concentrating ability (By similarity).
