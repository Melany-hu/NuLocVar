UniprotID	P42768
Accession	P42768;Q9BU11;Q9UNJ9
EntryName	WASP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Actin nucleation-promoting factor WAS (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) (WASp)
GeneName	WAS IMD2
Length	502
Function	Effector protein for Rho-type GTPases that regulates actin filament reorganization via its interaction with the Arp2/3 complex (PubMed:12235133, PubMed:12769847, PubMed:16275905). Important for efficient actin polymerization (PubMed:12235133, PubMed:16275905, PubMed:8625410). Possible regulator of lymphocyte and platelet function (PubMed:9405671). Mediates actin filament reorganization and the formation of actin pedestals upon infection by pathogenic bacteria (PubMed:18650809). In addition to its role in the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, also promotes actin polymerization in the nucleus, thereby regulating gene transcription and repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:20574068). Promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair in response to DNA damage by promoting nuclear actin polymerization, leading to drive motility of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:29925947).
