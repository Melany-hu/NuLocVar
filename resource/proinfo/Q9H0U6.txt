UniprotID	Q9H0U6
Accession	Q9H0U6;Q5TAP9;Q9NZW8
EntryName	RM18_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein uL18m (39S ribosomal protein L18, mitochondrial) (L18mt) (MRP-L18)
GeneName	MRPL18 HSPC071
Length	180
Function	Together with thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST), acts as a mitochondrial import factor for the cytosolic 5S rRNA. The precursor form shows RNA chaperone activity; is able to fold the 5S rRNA into an import-competent conformation that is recognized by rhodanese (TST). Both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial forms are able to bind to the helix IV-loop D in the gamma domain of the 5S rRNA.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
