ProteinName	Very long chain fatty acid elongase 1 (EC 2.3.1.199) (3-keto acyl-CoA synthase ELOVL1) (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 1) (ELOVL FA elongase 1) (Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 1) (Very long chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 1) (Very long chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA synthase 1)
GeneName	ELOVL1 SSC1 CGI-88
Length	279
Function	Catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction of the four reactions that constitute the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle (PubMed:29496980, PubMed:30487246). This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process allows the addition of 2 carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) per cycle. Condensing enzyme that exhibits activity toward saturated and monounsaturated acyl-CoA substrates, with the highest activity towards C22:0 acyl-CoA. May participate in the production of both saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators. Important for saturated C24:0 and monounsaturated C24:1 sphingolipid synthesis (PubMed:20937905). Indirectly inhibits RPE65 via production of VLCFAs.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
