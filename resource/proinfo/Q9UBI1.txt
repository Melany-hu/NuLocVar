UniprotID	Q9UBI1
Accession	Q9UBI1;D3DRU7;Q5T8Y9
EntryName	COMD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	COMM domain-containing protein 3 (Protein Bup) (Protein PIL)
GeneName	COMMD3 BUP C10orf8
Length	195
Function	May modulate activity of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes (PubMed:21778237). May down-regulate activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:15799966). Modulates Na(+) transport in epithelial cells by regulation of apical cell surface expression of amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (ENaC) subunits (PubMed:23637203).
