UniprotID	P04118
Accession	P04118;Q5T9G7;Q5U809
EntryName	COL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Colipase
GeneName	CLPS
Length	112
Function	Colipase is a cofactor of pancreatic lipase. It allows the lipase to anchor itself to the lipid-water interface. Without colipase the enzyme is washed off by bile salts, which have an inhibitory effect on the lipase.
