UniprotID	Q14894
Accession	Q14894;D5MNX0;Q5HYB7
EntryName	CRYM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ketimine reductase mu-crystallin (EC 1.5.1.25) (NADP-regulated thyroid-hormone-binding protein)
GeneName	CRYM THBP
Length	314
Function	Specifically catalyzes the reduction of imine bonds in brain substrates that may include cystathionine ketimine (CysK) and lanthionine ketimine (LK). Binds thyroid hormone which is a strong reversible inhibitor. Presumably involved in the regulation of the free intracellular concentration of triiodothyronine and access to its nuclear receptors.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
