UniprotID	Q00978
Accession	Q00978;D3DS61
EntryName	IRF9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF-9) (IFN-alpha-responsive transcription factor subunit) (ISGF3 p48 subunit) (Interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 gamma) (ISGF-3 gamma) (Transcriptional regulator ISGF3 subunit gamma)
GeneName	IRF9 ISGF3G
Length	393
Function	Transcription factor that plays an essential role in anti-viral immunity. It mediates signaling by type I IFNs (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta). Following type I IFN binding to cell surface receptors, Jak kinases (TYK2 and JAK1) are activated, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. IRF9/ISGF3G associates with the phosphorylated STAT1:STAT2 dimer to form a complex termed ISGF3 transcription factor, that enters the nucleus. ISGF3 binds to the IFN stimulated response element (ISRE) to activate the transcription of interferon stimulated genes, which drive the cell in an antiviral state.
