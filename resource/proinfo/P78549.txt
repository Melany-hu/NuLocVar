EntryName	NTH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endonuclease III-like protein 1 (hNTH1) (EC 3.2.2.-) (EC 4.2.99.18) (Bifunctional DNA N-glycosylase/DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase) (DNA glycosylase/AP lyase)
GeneName	NTHL1 NTH1 OCTS3
Length	304
Function	Bifunctional DNA N-glycosylase with associated apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase function that catalyzes the first step in base excision repair (BER), the primary repair pathway for the repair of oxidative DNA damage (PubMed:29610152, PubMed:9927729). The DNA N-glycosylase activity releases the damaged DNA base from DNA by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond, leaving an AP site. The AP-lyase activity cleaves the phosphodiester bond 3' to the AP site by a beta-elimination. Primarily recognizes and repairs oxidative base damage of pyrimidines. Also has 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) DNA glycosylase activity. Acts preferentially on DNA damage opposite guanine residues in DNA. Is able to process lesions in nucleosomes without requiring or inducing nucleosome disruption.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Mitochondrion
