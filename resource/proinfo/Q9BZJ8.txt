Accession	Q9BZJ8;A8K1W2;Q6NWS0;Q8TDV4;Q96PR4
EntryName	GPR61_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 61 (Biogenic amine receptor-like G-protein coupled receptor)
GeneName	GPR61 BALGR GPCR3
Length	451
Function	Orphan G-protein coupled receptor. Constitutively activates the G(s)-alpha/cAMP signaling pathway (PubMed:28827538). Shows a reciprocal regulatory interaction with the melatonin receptor MTNR1B most likely through receptor heteromerization (PubMed:28827538). May be involved in the regulation of food intake and body weight (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Endosome membrane
