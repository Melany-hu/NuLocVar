UniprotID	Q16611
Accession	Q16611;C0H5Y7;Q6I9T6;Q92533
EntryName	BAK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Apoptosis regulator BAK) (Bcl-2-like protein 7) (Bcl2-L-7)
GeneName	BAK1 BAK BCL2L7 CDN1
Length	211
Function	Plays a role in the mitochondrial apoptotic process. Upon arrival of cell death signals, promotes mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) permeabilization by oligomerizing to form pores within the MOM. This releases apoptogenic factors into the cytosol, including cytochrome c, promoting the activation of caspase 9 which in turn processes and activates the effector caspases.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane
