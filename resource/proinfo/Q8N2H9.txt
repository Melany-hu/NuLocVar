EntryName	PELI3_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase pellino homolog 3 (Pellino-3) (EC 2.3.2.27)
GeneName	PELI3
Length	469
Function	E3 ubiquitin ligase catalyzing the covalent attachment of ubiquitin moieties onto substrate proteins (PubMed:12874243, PubMed:17675297). Involved in the TLR and IL-1 signaling pathways via interaction with the complex containing IRAK kinases and TRAF6 (PubMed:12874243). Mediates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK1 (PubMed:12874243). Can activate AP1/JUN and ELK1 (PubMed:12874243). Acts as a regulator of innate immunity by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIPK2 downstream of NOD1 and NOD2, thereby transforming RIPK2 into a scaffolding protein for downstream effectors, ultimately leading to activation of the NF-kappa-B and MAP kinases signaling (By similarity). Catalyzes 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIPK2 in parallel of XIAP (By similarity).
