UniprotID	Q6TFL4
Accession	Q6TFL4;A5PLN8;Q9H620;Q9NXT9
EntryName	KLH24_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kelch-like protein 24 (Kainate receptor-interacting protein for GluR6) (KRIP6) (Protein DRE1)
GeneName	KLHL24 DRE1
Length	600
Function	Necessary to maintain the balance between intermediate filament stability and degradation, a process that is essential for skin integrity (PubMed:27889062). As part of the BCR(KLHL24) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, mediates ubiquitination of KRT14 and controls its levels during keratinocytes differentiation (PubMed:27798626). Specifically reduces kainate receptor-mediated currents in hippocampal neurons, most probably by modulating channel properties (By similarity). Has a crucial role in cardiac development and function (PubMed:30715372).
