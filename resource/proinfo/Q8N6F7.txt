UniprotID	Q8N6F7
Accession	Q8N6F7;C9JD17;C9JUG6
EntryName	GCSAM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Germinal center-associated signaling and motility protein (Germinal center B-cell-expressed transcript 2 protein) (Germinal center-associated lymphoma protein) (hGAL)
GeneName	GCSAM GAL GCET2
Length	178
Function	Involved in the negative regulation of lymphocyte motility. It mediates the migration-inhibitory effects of IL6. Serves as a positive regulator of the RhoA signaling pathway. Enhancement of RhoA activation results in inhibition of lymphocyte and lymphoma cell motility by activation of its downstream effector ROCK. Is a regulator of B-cell receptor signaling, that acts through SYK kinase activation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cell membrane
