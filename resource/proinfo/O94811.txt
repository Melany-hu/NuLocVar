Length	219
Function	Regulator of microtubule dynamics that plays a key role in myelination by promoting elongation of the myelin sheath (PubMed:31522887). Acts as a microtubule nucleation factor in oligodendrocytes: specifically localizes to the postsynaptic Golgi apparatus region, also named Golgi outpost, and promotes microtubule nucleation, an important step for elongation of the myelin sheath (PubMed:31522887, PubMed:33831707). Required for both uniform polarized growth of distal microtubules as well as directing the branching of proximal processes (PubMed:31522887). Shows magnesium-dependent GTPase activity; the role of the GTPase activity is unclear (PubMed:21316364, PubMed:21995432). In addition to microtubule nucleation activity, also involved in microtubule bundling and stabilization of existing microtubules, thereby maintaining the integrity of the microtubule network (PubMed:17105200, PubMed:17693641, PubMed:18028908, PubMed:26289831). Regulates microtubule dynamics by promoting tubulin acetylation: acts by inhibiting the tubulin deacetylase activity of HDAC6 (PubMed:20308065, PubMed:23093407). Also regulates cell migration: phosphorylation by ROCK1 inhibits interaction with HDAC6, resulting in decreased acetylation of tubulin and increased cell motility (PubMed:23093407). Plays a role in cell proliferation by regulating the G1/S-phase transition (PubMed:23355470). Involved in astral microtubule organization and mitotic spindle orientation during early stage of mitosis; this process is regulated by phosphorylation by LIMK2 (PubMed:22328514).
