UniprotID	Q9Y2X3
Accession	Q9Y2X3;Q53SA4;Q6PK08;Q9P036;Q9UFN3
EntryName	NOP58_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleolar protein 58 (Nucleolar protein 5)
GeneName	NOP58 NOL5 NOP5 HSPC120
Length	529
Function	Required for the biogenesis of box C/D snoRNAs such as U3, U8 and U14 snoRNAs (PubMed:15574333, PubMed:17636026, PubMed:19620283, PubMed:34516797). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797). Core component of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complexes that function in methylation of multiple sites on ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (PubMed:39570315).
