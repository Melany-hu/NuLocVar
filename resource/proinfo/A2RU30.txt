UniprotID	A2RU30
Accession	A2RU30;B4DPM3;B4E048;B7Z9K7;O94849;Q4G0P2;Q9P0C4
EntryName	TESP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein TESPA1 (Thymocyte-expressed positive selection-associated protein 1)
GeneName	TESPA1 KIAA0748 HSPC257
Length	521
Function	Required for the development and maturation of T-cells, its function being essential for the late stages of thymocyte development (By similarity). Plays a role in T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-mediated activation of the ERK and NFAT signaling pathways, possibly by serving as a scaffolding protein that promotes the assembly of the LAT signalosome in thymocytes. May play a role in the regulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-mediated Ca(2+) release and mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake via the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM) compartment.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
