UniprotID	Q9UBX0
Accession	Q9UBX0;Q52LC5;Q99667
EntryName	HESX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox expressed in ES cells 1 (Homeobox protein ANF) (hAnf)
GeneName	HESX1 HANF
Length	185
Function	Required for the normal development of the forebrain, eyes and other anterior structures such as the olfactory placodes and pituitary gland. Possible transcriptional repressor. Binds to the palindromic PIII sequence, 5'-AGCTTGAGTCTAATTGAATTAACTGTAC-3'. HESX1 and PROP1 bind as heterodimers on this palindromic site, and, in vitro, HESX1 can antagonize PROP1 activation.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
