UniprotID	P59901
Accession	P59901;Q32MC4
EntryName	LIRA4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily A member 4 (CD85 antigen-like family member G) (Immunoglobulin-like transcript 7) (ILT-7) (CD antigen CD85g)
GeneName	LILRA4 ILT7
Length	499
Function	Functions coreceptor to limit the innate immune responses to viral infections; signaling occurs via FCER1G (PubMed:16735691, PubMed:19564354). Down-regulates the production of IFNA1, IFNA2, IFNA4, IFNB1 and TNF by plasmacytoid dendritic cells that have been exposed to influenza virus or cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) dinucleotides, indicating it functions as a negative regulator of TLR7 and TLR9 signaling cascades (PubMed:16735691, PubMed:19564354, PubMed:24586760). Down-regulates interferon production in response to interaction with BST2 on HIV-1 infected cells (PubMed:26172439). Activates a signaling cascade in complex with FCER1G that results in phosphorylation of Src family and Syk kinases and thereby triggers mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) (PubMed:16735691, PubMed:19564354). Does not interfere with the differentiation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells into antigen-presenting cells (PubMed:24586760).
