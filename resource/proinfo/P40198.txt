UniprotID	P40198
Accession	P40198;G5E978;Q3KPH9
EntryName	CEAM3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cell adhesion molecule CEACAM3 (Carcinoembryonic antigen CGM1) (Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 3) (CEA cell adhesion molecule 3) (CD antigen CD66d)
GeneName	CEACAM3 CD66D CGM1
Length	252
Function	Major granulocyte receptor mediating recognition and efficient opsonin-independent phagocytosis of CEACAM-binding microorganisms, including Neissiria, Moxarella and Haemophilus species, thus playing an important role in the clearance of pathogens by the innate immune system. Responsible for RAC1 stimulation in the course of pathogen phagocytosis.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
