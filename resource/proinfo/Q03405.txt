EntryName	UPAR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (U-PAR) (uPAR) (Monocyte activation antigen Mo3) (CD antigen CD87)
GeneName	PLAUR MO3 UPAR
Length	335
Function	Acts as a receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator (PubMed:15677461). Plays a role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation. Mediates the proteolysis-independent signal transduction activation effects of U-PA. It is subject to negative-feedback regulation by U-PA which cleaves it into an inactive form.
