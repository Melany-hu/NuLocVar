UniprotID	Q86YJ5
Accession	Q86YJ5;B2R9U9;Q86VN5;Q96GG2
EntryName	MARH9_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MARCHF9 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Membrane-associated RING finger protein 9) (Membrane-associated RING-CH protein IX) (MARCH-IX) (RING finger protein 179) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase MARCHF9)
GeneName	MARCHF9 MARCH9 RNF179
Length	346
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that may mediate ubiquitination of MHC-I, CD4 and ICAM1, and promote their subsequent endocytosis and sorting to lysosomes via multivesicular bodies. E3 ubiquitin ligases accept ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester and then directly transfer the ubiquitin to targeted substrates.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Lysosome membrane
