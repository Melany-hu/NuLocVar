UniprotID	Q9HAC8
Accession	Q9HAC8;D3DR57;Q53HI3
EntryName	UBTD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin domain-containing protein 1
GeneName	UBTD1
Length	227
Function	May be involved in the regulation of cellular senescence through a positive feedback loop with TP53. Is a TP53 downstream target gene that increases the stability of TP53 protein by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of MDM2.
