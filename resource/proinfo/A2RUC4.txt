UniprotID	A2RUC4
Accession	A2RUC4;B2RNE3;Q8N1R2
EntryName	TYW5_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA wybutosine-synthesizing protein 5 (hTYW5) (tRNA yW-synthesizing protein 5) (EC 1.14.11.42) (tRNA(Phe) (7-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)wyosine(37)-C(2))-hydroxylase)
GeneName	TYW5 C2orf60
Length	315
Function	tRNA hydroxylase that acts as a component of the wybutosine biosynthesis pathway. Wybutosine is a hyper modified guanosine with a tricyclic base found at the 3'-position adjacent to the anticodon of eukaryotic phenylalanine tRNA. Catalyzes the hydroxylation of 7-(a-amino-a-carboxypropyl)wyosine (yW-72) into undermodified hydroxywybutosine (OHyW*). OHyW* being further transformed into hydroxywybutosine (OHyW) by LCMT2/TYW4. OHyW is a derivative of wybutosine found in higher eukaryotes.
