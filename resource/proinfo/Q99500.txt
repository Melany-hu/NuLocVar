UniprotID	Q99500
Accession	Q99500;Q5SQD8;Q7Z5I2
EntryName	S1PR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 3 (S1P receptor 3) (S1P3) (Endothelial differentiation G-protein coupled receptor 3) (Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor Edg-3) (S1P receptor Edg-3)
GeneName	S1PR3 C9orf108 C9orf47 EDG3
Length	378
Function	Receptor for the lysosphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is a bioactive lysophospholipid that elicits diverse physiological effect on most types of cells and tissues. When expressed in rat HTC4 hepatoma cells, is capable of mediating S1P-induced cell proliferation and suppression of apoptosis.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
