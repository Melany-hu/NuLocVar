UniprotID	Q9Y2T2
Accession	Q9Y2T2;Q5JQ12;Q9H5L2
EntryName	AP3M1_HUMAN
ProteinName	AP-3 complex subunit mu-1 (AP-3 adaptor complex mu3A subunit) (Adaptor-related protein complex 3 subunit mu-1) (Mu-adaptin 3A) (Mu3A-adaptin)
GeneName	AP3M1
Length	418
Function	Part of the AP-3 complex, an adaptor-related complex which is not clathrin-associated. The complex is associated with the Golgi region as well as more peripheral structures. It facilitates the budding of vesicles from the Golgi membrane and may be directly involved in trafficking to lysosomes. In concert with the BLOC-1 complex, AP-3 is required to target cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane
