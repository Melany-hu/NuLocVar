UniprotID	P43626
Accession	P43626;O43470;Q32WE6;Q6H2H3;Q6IST4
EntryName	KI2L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 2DL1 (CD158 antigen-like family member A) (Natural killer-associated transcript 1) (NKAT-1) (p58 natural killer cell receptor clones CL-42/47.11) (p58 NK receptor CL-42/47.11) (p58.1 MHC class-I-specific NK receptor) (CD antigen CD158a)
GeneName	KIR2DL1 CD158A NKAT1
Length	348
Function	Receptor on natural killer (NK) cells for some HLA-C alleles such as w4 and w6. Inhibits the activity of NK cells thus preventing cell lysis.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
