UniprotID	Q13207
Accession	Q13207;Q16424;Q7Z647
EntryName	TBX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	T-box transcription factor TBX2 (T-box protein 2)
GeneName	TBX2
Length	712
Function	Transcription factor which acts as a transcriptional repressor (PubMed:11062467, PubMed:11111039, PubMed:12000749, PubMed:22844464, PubMed:30599067). May also function as a transcriptional activator (By similarity). Binds to the palindromic T site 5'-TTCACACCTAGGTGTGAA-3' DNA sequence, or a half-site, which are present in the regulatory region of several genes (PubMed:11111039, PubMed:12000749, PubMed:22844464, PubMed:30599067). Required for cardiac atrioventricular canal formation (PubMed:29726930). May cooperate with NKX2.5 to negatively modulate expression of NPPA/ANF in the atrioventricular canal (By similarity). May play a role as a positive regulator of TGFB2 expression, perhaps acting in concert with GATA4 in the developing outflow tract myocardium (By similarity). Plays a role in limb pattern formation (PubMed:29726930). Acts as a transcriptional repressor of ADAM10 gene expression, perhaps in concert with histone deacetylase HDAC1 as cofactor (PubMed:30599067). Involved in branching morphogenesis in both developing lungs and adult mammary glands, via negative modulation of target genes; acting redundantly with TBX3 (By similarity). Required, together with TBX3, to maintain cell proliferation in the embryonic lung mesenchyme; perhaps acting downstream of SHH, BMP and TGFbeta signaling (By similarity). Involved in modulating early inner ear development, acting independently of, and also redundantly with TBX3, in different subregions of the developing ear (By similarity). Acts as a negative regulator of PML function in cellular senescence (PubMed:22002537). Acts as a negative regulator of expression of CDKN1A/p21, IL33 and CCN4; repression of CDKN1A is enhanced in response to UV-induced stress, perhaps as a result of phosphorylation by p38 MAPK (By similarity). Negatively modulates expression of CDKN2A/p14ARF and CDH1/E-cadherin (PubMed:11062467, PubMed:12000749, PubMed:22844464). Plays a role in induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (PubMed:22844464). Plays a role in melanocyte proliferation, perhaps via regulation of cyclin CCND1 (By similarity). Involved in melanogenesis, acting via negative modulation of expression of DHICA oxidase/TYRP1 and P protein/OCA2 (By similarity). Involved in regulating retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell proliferation, perhaps via negatively modulating transcription of the transcription factor CEBPD (PubMed:28910203).
