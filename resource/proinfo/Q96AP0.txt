Accession	Q96AP0;A0A0C4DGT6;Q562H5;Q9H8F9
EntryName	ACD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adrenocortical dysplasia protein homolog (POT1 and TIN2-interacting protein)
GeneName	ACD PIP1 PTOP TINT1 TPP1
Length	458
Function	Component of the shelterin complex (telosome) that is involved in the regulation of telomere length and protection. Shelterin associates with arrays of double-stranded TTAGGG repeats added by telomerase and protects chromosome ends. Without its protective activity, telomeres are no longer hidden from the DNA damage surveillance and chromosome ends are inappropriately processed by DNA repair pathways. Promotes binding of POT1 to single-stranded telomeric DNA. Modulates the inhibitory effects of POT1 on telomere elongation. The ACD-POT1 heterodimer enhances telomere elongation by recruiting telomerase to telomeres and increasing its processivity. May play a role in organogenesis.
