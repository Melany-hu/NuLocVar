UniprotID	Q9UDX5
Accession	Q9UDX5;A6NFQ5;Q9H3K1;Q9P0N6
EntryName	MTFP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial fission process protein 1 (Mitochondrial 18 kDa protein) (MTP18)
GeneName	MTFP1 MTP18 HSPC242 My022
Length	166
Function	Involved in the mitochondrial division probably by regulating membrane fission. Loss-of-function induces the release of cytochrome c, which activates the caspase cascade and leads to apoptosis.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
