EntryName	IDHC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP] cytoplasmic (IDH) (IDH1) (EC 1.1.1.42) (Cytosolic NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase) (IDPc) (NADP(+)-specific ICDH) (Oxalosuccinate decarboxylase)
GeneName	IDH1 PICD
Length	414
Function	Catalyzes the NADP(+)-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate (D-threo-isocitrate) to 2-ketoglutarate (2-oxoglutarate), which is required by other enzymes such as the phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase (PubMed:10521434, PubMed:19935646). Plays a critical role in the generation of NADPH, an important cofactor in many biosynthesis pathways (PubMed:10521434). May act as a corneal epithelial crystallin and may be involved in maintaining corneal epithelial transparency (By similarity).
