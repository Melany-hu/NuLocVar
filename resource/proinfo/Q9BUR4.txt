EntryName	TCAB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Telomerase Cajal body protein 1 (WD repeat-containing protein 79) (WD40 repeat-containing protein antisense to TP53 gene) (WRAP53beta)
GeneName	WRAP53 TCAB1 WDR79
Length	548
Function	RNA chaperone that plays a key role in telomere maintenance and RNA localization to Cajal bodies (PubMed:29695869, PubMed:29804836). Specifically recognizes and binds the Cajal body box (CAB box) present in both small Cajal body RNAs (scaRNAs) and telomerase RNA template component (TERC) (PubMed:19285445, PubMed:20351177, PubMed:29695869, PubMed:29804836). Essential component of the telomerase holoenzyme complex, a ribonucleoprotein complex essential for the replication of chromosome termini that elongates telomeres in most eukaryotes (PubMed:19179534, PubMed:20351177, PubMed:26170453, PubMed:29695869). In the telomerase holoenzyme complex, required to stimulate the catalytic activity of the complex (PubMed:27525486, PubMed:29804836). Acts by specifically binding the CAB box of the TERC RNA and controlling the folding of the CR4/CR5 region of the TERC RNA, a critical step for telomerase activity (PubMed:29804836). In addition, also controls telomerase holoenzyme complex localization to Cajal body (PubMed:22547674). During S phase, required for delivery of TERC to telomeres during S phase and for telomerase activity (PubMed:29804836). In addition to its role in telomere maintenance, also required for Cajal body formation, probably by mediating localization of scaRNAs to Cajal bodies (PubMed:19285445, PubMed:21072240). Also plays a role in DNA repair: phosphorylated by ATM in response to DNA damage and relocalizes to sites of DNA double-strand breaks to promote the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (PubMed:25512560, PubMed:27715493). Acts by recruiting the ubiquitin ligase RNF8 to DNA breaks and promote both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (PubMed:25512560, PubMed:27715493).
