UniprotID	P54845
Accession	P54845;A8MX14;Q53XD0
EntryName	NRL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neural retina-specific leucine zipper protein (NRL)
GeneName	NRL D14S46E
Length	237
Function	Acts as a transcriptional activator which regulates the expression of several rod-specific genes, including RHO and PDE6B (PubMed:21981118). Also functions as a transcriptional coactivator, stimulating transcription mediated by the transcription factor CRX and NR2E3 (PubMed:17335001). Binds to the rhodopsin promoter in a sequence-specific manner (PubMed:17335001).
