EntryName	CD177_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD177 antigen (Human neutrophil alloantigen 2a) (HNA-2a) (NB1 glycoprotein) (NB1 GP) (Polycythemia rubra vera protein 1) (PRV-1) (CD antigen CD177)
GeneName	CD177 NB1 PRV1 UNQ595/PRO1181
Length	437
Function	In association with beta-2 integrin heterodimer ITGAM/CD11b and ITGB2/CD18, mediates activation of TNF-alpha primed neutrophils including degranulation and superoxide production (PubMed:21193407). In addition, by preventing beta-2 integrin internalization and attenuating chemokine signaling favors adhesion over migration (PubMed:28807980). Heterophilic interaction with PECAM1 on endothelial cells plays a role in neutrophil transendothelial migration in vitro (PubMed:17580308). However, appears to be dispensable for neutrophil recruitment caused by bacterial infection in vivo (PubMed:23461681). Acts as a receptor for the mature form of protease PRTN3 allowing its display at the cell surface of neutrophils (PubMed:17244676, PubMed:18462208). By displaying PRTN3 at the neutrophil cell surface, may play a role in enhancing endothelial cell junctional integrity and thus vascular integrity during neutrophil diapedesis (PubMed:23202369).
