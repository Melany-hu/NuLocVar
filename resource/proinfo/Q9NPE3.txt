UniprotID	Q9NPE3
Accession	Q9NPE3
EntryName	NOP10_HUMAN
ProteinName	H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex subunit 3 (Nucleolar protein 10) (Nucleolar protein family A member 3) (snoRNP protein NOP10)
GeneName	NOP10 NOLA3
Length	64
Function	Required for ribosome biogenesis and telomere maintenance. Part of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (H/ACA snoRNP) complex, which catalyzes pseudouridylation of rRNA (PubMed:32554502). This involves the isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is subsequently attached to C5, instead of the normal N1. Each rRNA can contain up to 100 pseudouridine ('psi') residues, which may serve to stabilize the conformation of rRNAs. May also be required for correct processing or intranuclear trafficking of TERC, the RNA component of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) holoenzyme.
