EntryName	AGRG3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor G3 (G-protein coupled receptor 97) (G-protein coupled receptor PGR26)
GeneName	ADGRG3 GPR97 PGR26
Length	549
Function	Adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) that plays a role in the regulation of various processes including B-cell development, inflammation or innate immunity. Acts upon activation by ligands including glucocorticoid hormones such as cortisol, cortisone and 11-deoxycortisol (PubMed:33408414). Regulates migration of lymphatic endothelial cells in vitro via the small GTPases RhoA and CDC42 (PubMed:24178298). Seems to signal through G-alpha(q)-proteins (PubMed:22575658). Provides basal Galphas/cAMP-mediated signal transduction, which has been shown to inhibit NF-kappa-B transcriptional activity. Antibody ligation leads to the production and activation of antimicrobial mediators like reactive oxygen species (ROS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) as well as enhanced bacteria uptake and killing by granulocytes (PubMed:30559745). Additionally, collaborates with protease-activated receptor 2/PAR2 to stimulate neutrophil-driven antimicrobial responses and endothelial cell activation (PubMed:36302784).
