UniprotID	Q693B1-2
Accession	Q693B1;B3KPE0
EntryName	KCD11_HUMAN
ProteinName	BTB/POZ domain-containing protein KCTD11 (KCASH1 protein) (Potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 11) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase subunit KCTD11)
GeneName	KCTD11 C17orf36 REN
Length	271
Function	Plays a role as a marker and a regulator of neuronal differentiation; Up-regulated by a variety of neurogenic signals, such as retinoic acid, epidermal growth factor/EGF and NGFB/nerve growth factor. Induces apoptosis, growth arrest and the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1B. Plays a role as a tumor repressor and inhibits cell growth and tumorigenicity of medulloblastoma (MDB). Acts as a probable substrate-specific adapter for a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex towards HDAC1. Functions as antagonist of the Hedgehog pathway on cell proliferation and differentiation by affecting the nuclear transfer of transcription factor GLI1, thus maintaining cerebellar granule cells in undifferentiated state, this effect probably occurs via HDAC1 down-regulation, keeping GLI1 acetylated and inactive. When knock-down, Hedgehog antagonism is impaired and proliferation of granule cells is sustained. Activates the caspase cascade.
