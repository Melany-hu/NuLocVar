UniprotID	Q96DC9
Accession	Q96DC9;Q6IA10;Q9H6T1
EntryName	OTUB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin thioesterase OTUB2 (EC 3.4.19.12) (Deubiquitinating enzyme OTUB2) (OTU domain-containing ubiquitin aldehyde-binding protein 2) (Otubain-2) (Ubiquitin-specific-processing protease OTUB2)
GeneName	OTUB2 C14orf137 OTB2 OTU2
Length	234
Function	Hydrolase that can remove conjugated ubiquitin from proteins in vitro and may therefore play an important regulatory role at the level of protein turnover by preventing degradation. Mediates deubiquitination of 'Lys-11'-,'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains, with a preference for 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains.
