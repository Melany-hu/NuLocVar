UniprotID	O76081
Accession	O76081;Q96BG9
EntryName	RGS20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 20 (RGS20) (Gz-selective GTPase-activating protein) (G(z)GAP) (Gz-GAP) (Regulator of G-protein signaling Z1) (Regulator of Gz-selective protein signaling 1)
GeneName	RGS20 RGSZ1 ZGAP1
Length	388
Function	Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form. Binds selectively to G(z)-alpha and G(alpha)-i2 subunits, accelerates their GTPase activity and regulates their signaling activities. The G(z)-alpha activity is inhibited by the phosphorylation and palmitoylation of the G-protein. Negatively regulates mu-opioid receptor-mediated activation of the G-proteins (By similarity).
