UniprotID	Q56NI9
Accession	Q56NI9;B3KW59;Q49AP4
EntryName	ESCO2_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acetyltransferase ESCO2 (EC 2.3.1.-) (Establishment factor-like protein 2) (EFO2) (EFO2p) (hEFO2) (Establishment of cohesion 1 homolog 2) (ECO1 homolog 2)
GeneName	ESCO2
Length	601
Function	Acetyltransferase required for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion (PubMed:15821733, PubMed:15958495). Couples the processes of cohesion and DNA replication to ensure that only sister chromatids become paired together. In contrast to the structural cohesins, the deposition and establishment factors are required only during the S phase. Acetylates the cohesin component SMC3 (PubMed:21111234).
