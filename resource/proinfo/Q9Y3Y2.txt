EntryName	CHTOP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chromatin target of PRMT1 protein (Friend of PRMT1 protein) (Small arginine- and glycine-rich protein) (SRAG)
GeneName	CHTOP C1orf77 FOP HT031 PP7704
Length	248
Function	Plays an important role in the ligand-dependent activation of estrogen receptor target genes (PubMed:19858291). May play a role in the silencing of fetal globin genes (PubMed:20688955). Recruits the 5FMC complex to ZNF148, leading to desumoylation of ZNF148 and subsequent transactivation of ZNF148 target genes (By similarity). Plays an important role in the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells. Binds to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and associates with the methylosome complex containing PRMT1, PRMT5, MEP50 and ERH. The CHTOP-methylosome complex associated with 5hmC is recruited to selective sites on the chromosome, where it methylates H4R3 and activates the transcription of genes involved in glioblastomagenesis (PubMed:25284789).
