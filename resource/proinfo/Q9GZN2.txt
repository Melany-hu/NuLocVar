UniprotID	Q9GZN2
Accession	Q9GZN2;B2R9U3;E1P5T9;H0YNI0
EntryName	TGIF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein TGIF2 (5'-TG-3'-interacting factor 2) (TGF-beta-induced transcription factor 2) (TGFB-induced factor 2)
GeneName	TGIF2
Length	237
Function	Transcriptional repressor, which probably repress transcription by binding directly the 5'-CTGTCAA-3' DNA sequence or by interacting with TGF-beta activated SMAD proteins. Probably represses transcription via the recruitment of histone deacetylase proteins.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
