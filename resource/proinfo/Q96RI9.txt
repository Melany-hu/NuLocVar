UniprotID	Q96RI9
Accession	Q96RI9
EntryName	TAAR9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trace amine-associated receptor 9 (TaR-9) (Trace amine receptor 9) (Trace amine receptor 3) (TaR-3)
GeneName	TAAR9 TA3 TAR3 TRAR3
Length	348
Function	Olfactory receptor specific for trace amines, such as N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine (DMCHA) and beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA) (By similarity). In contrast to mouse and rat orthologs, not activated by triethylamine, cadaverine (CAD) or spermidine (PubMed:34600890). Trace amine compounds are enriched in animal body fluids and act on trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) to elicit both intraspecific and interspecific innate behaviors (By similarity). Trace amine-binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via G(s)-class of G alpha proteins (GNAL or GNAS) (By similarity). In mature olfactory sensory neurons, TAAR9 is coupled with GNAL/G(olf)G alpha protein and mediates activation of adenylate cyclase activity to activate cAMP signaling and eventually transmit odorant signals to achieve membrane depolarization (By similarity). In immature olfactory sensory neurons, TAAR9 is coupled with GNAS/G(s) G alpha proteins (By similarity).
