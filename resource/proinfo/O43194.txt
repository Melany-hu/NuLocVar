Function	Zinc-sensing receptor that can sense changes in extracellular Zn(2+), mediate Zn(2+) signal transmission, and participates in the regulation of numerous physiological processes including glucose homeostasis regulation, gastrointestinal mobility, hormone secretion and cell death (PubMed:18180304). Activation by Zn(2+) in keratinocytes increases the intracellular concentration of Ca(2+) and activates the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways leading to epithelial repair (PubMed:20522546). Plays an essential role in normal wound healing by inducing the production of cytokines including the major inflammatory cytokine IL6 via the PKC/MAPK/CEBPB pathway (By similarity). Regulates adipose tissue metabolism, especially lipolysis, and regulates the function of lipases, such as hormone-sensitive lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase (By similarity). Plays a role in the inhibition of cell death and protects against oxidative, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial stress by inducing secretion of the cytoprotective pigment epithelium-derived growth factor (PEDF) and probably other protective transcripts in a GNA13/RHOA/SRE-dependent manner (PubMed:18180304). Forms dynamic heteroreceptor complexes with HTR1A and GALR1 depending on cell type or specific physiological states, resulting in signaling diversity: HTR1A-GPR39 shows additive increase in signaling along the serum response element (SRE) and NF-kappa-B pathways while GALR1 acts as an antagonist blocking SRE (PubMed:26365466).
