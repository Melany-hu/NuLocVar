UniprotID	Q86U42
Accession	Q86U42;D3DS49;O43484
EntryName	PABP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polyadenylate-binding protein 2 (PABP-2) (Poly(A)-binding protein 2) (Nuclear poly(A)-binding protein 1) (Poly(A)-binding protein II) (PABII) (Polyadenylate-binding nuclear protein 1)
GeneName	PABPN1 PAB2 PABP2
Length	306
Function	Involved in the 3'-end formation of mRNA precursors (pre-mRNA) by the addition of a poly(A) tail of 200-250 nt to the upstream cleavage product (By similarity). Stimulates poly(A) polymerase (PAPOLA) conferring processivity on the poly(A) tail elongation reaction and also controls the poly(A) tail length (By similarity). Increases the affinity of poly(A) polymerase for RNA (By similarity). Is also present at various stages of mRNA metabolism including nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mRNA. Cooperates with SKIP to synergistically activate E-box-mediated transcription through MYOD1 and may regulate the expression of muscle-specific genes (PubMed:11371506). Binds to poly(A) and to poly(G) with high affinity (By similarity). May protect the poly(A) tail from degradation (By similarity). Subunit of the trimeric poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) complex, a complex that directs a subset of long and polyadenylated poly(A) RNAs for exosomal degradation. The RNA exosome is fundamental for the degradation of RNA in eukaryotic nuclei. Substrate targeting is facilitated by its cofactor MTREX, which links to RNA-binding protein adapters (PubMed:27871484).
