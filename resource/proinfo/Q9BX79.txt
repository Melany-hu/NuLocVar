EntryName	STRA6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Receptor for retinol uptake STRA6 (Retinol-binding protein receptor STRA6) (Stimulated by retinoic acid gene 6 protein homolog)
GeneName	STRA6 PP14296 UNQ3126/PRO10282/PRO19578
Length	667
Function	Functions as a retinol transporter. Accepts all-trans retinol from the extracellular retinol-binding protein RBP4, facilitates retinol transport across the cell membrane, and then transfers retinol to the cytoplasmic retinol-binding protein RBP1 (PubMed:18316031, PubMed:22665496, PubMed:9452451). Retinol uptake is enhanced by LRAT, an enzyme that converts retinol to all-trans retinyl esters, the storage forms of vitamin A (PubMed:18316031, PubMed:22665496). Contributes to the activation of a signaling cascade that depends on retinol transport and LRAT-dependent generation of retinol metabolites that then trigger activation of JAK2 and its target STAT5, and ultimately increase the expression of SOCS3 and inhibit cellular responses to insulin (PubMed:21368206, PubMed:22665496). Important for the homeostasis of vitamin A and its derivatives, such as retinoic acid (PubMed:18316031). STRA6-mediated transport is particularly important in the eye, and under conditions of dietary vitamin A deficiency (Probable). Does not transport retinoic acid (PubMed:18316031).
