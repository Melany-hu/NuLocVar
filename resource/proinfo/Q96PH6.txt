UniprotID	Q96PH6
Accession	Q96PH6;Q17RC4;Q8N691;Q9NUH0
EntryName	DB118_HUMAN
ProteinName	Defensin beta 118 (Beta-defensin 18) (DEFB-18) (Epididymal secretory protein 13.6) (ESP13.6)
GeneName	DEFB118 C20orf63 DEFB18 ESC42
Length	123
Function	Host defense peptide that exhibits antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative bacteria, such as E.coli and S.typhimurium, and Gram-positive bacteria, such as S.aureus and B.subtilis (PubMed:15033915, PubMed:33224970). Inhibits cell adhesion of E.coli on intestinal epithelial enterocytes (PubMed:33224970). Causes rapid permeabilization of both the outer and inner membrane of E.coli, leading to morphological alterations on the bacterial surface (PubMed:15033915). Binds to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) with high affinity, and may thereby be involved in immunoregulation through LPS neutralization (PubMed:33181266). May contribute to epididymal innate immunity and protect the sperm against attack by microorganisms (PubMed:15033915).
