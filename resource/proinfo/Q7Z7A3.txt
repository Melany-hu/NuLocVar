UniprotID	Q7Z7A3
Accession	Q7Z7A3;A8K558;Q96GZ7
EntryName	CTU1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytoplasmic tRNA 2-thiolation protein 1 (EC 2.7.7.-) (ATP-binding domain-containing protein 3) (Cancer-associated gene protein) (Cytoplasmic tRNA adenylyltransferase 1)
GeneName	CTU1 ATPBD3 NCS6
Length	348
Function	Plays a central role in 2-thiolation of mcm(5)S(2)U at tRNA wobble positions of tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln). Directly binds tRNAs and probably acts by catalyzing adenylation of tRNAs, an intermediate required for 2-thiolation. It is unclear whether it acts as a sulfurtransferase that transfers sulfur from thiocarboxylated URM1 onto the uridine of tRNAs at wobble position.
