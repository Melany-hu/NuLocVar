EntryName	MAX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein max (Class D basic helix-loop-helix protein 4) (bHLHd4) (Myc-associated factor X)
GeneName	MAX BHLHD4
Length	160
Function	Transcription regulator. Forms a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein complex with MYC or MAD which recognizes the core sequence 5'-CACTG-3'. The MYC:MAX complex is a transcriptional activator, whereas the MAD:MAX complex is a repressor. May repress transcription via the recruitment of a chromatin remodeling complex containing H3 'Lys-9' histone methyltransferase activity. Represses MYC transcriptional activity from E-box elements.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cell projection; Dendrite
