UniprotID	Q9BR61
Accession	Q9BR61
EntryName	ACBD6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acyl-CoA-binding domain-containing protein 6
GeneName	ACBD6
Length	282
Function	Binds long-chain acyl-coenzyme A molecules with a strong preference for unsaturated C18:1-CoA, lower affinity for unsaturated C20:4-CoA, and very weak affinity for saturated C16:0-CoA. Does not bind fatty acids. Plays a role in protein N-myristoylation (PubMed:37951597).
