EntryName	CP2C8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 2C8 (EC 1.14.14.1) (CYPIIC8) (Cytochrome P450 IIC2) (Cytochrome P450 MP-12) (Cytochrome P450 MP-20) (Cytochrome P450 form 1) (S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylase)
GeneName	CYP2C8
Length	490
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids, steroid hormones and vitamins (PubMed:11093772, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:11093772, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697). Primarily catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with a preference for the last double bond (PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes all trans-retinoic acid toward its 4-hydroxylated form (PubMed:11093772). Displays 16-alpha hydroxylase activity toward estrogen steroid hormones, 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) (PubMed:14559847). Plays a role in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. It is the principal enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (taxol) (PubMed:26427316).
