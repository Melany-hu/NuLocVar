UniprotID	Q96SQ9
Accession	Q96SQ9;Q9BZ66
EntryName	CP2S1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 2S1 (EC 1.14.14.-) (CYPIIS1) (Hydroperoxy icosatetraenoate dehydratase) (EC 4.2.1.152) (Thromboxane-A synthase) (EC 5.3.99.5)
GeneName	CYP2S1 UNQ891/PRO1906
Length	504
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of retinoids and eicosanoids (PubMed:12711469, PubMed:21068195). In epidermis, may contribute to the oxidative metabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid. For this activity, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:12711469). Additionally, displays peroxidase and isomerase activities toward various oxygenated eicosanoids such as prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoates (HPETEs) (PubMed:21068195). Independently of cytochrome P450 reductase, NADPH, and O2, catalyzes the breakdown of PGH2 to hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) and malondialdehyde (MDA), which is known to act as a mediator of DNA damage (PubMed:21068195).
