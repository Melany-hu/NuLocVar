EntryName	INT12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Integrator complex subunit 12 (Int12) (PHD finger protein 22)
GeneName	INTS12 PHF22 SBBI22
Length	462
Function	Component of the integrator complex, a multiprotein complex that terminates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription in the promoter-proximal region of genes (PubMed:38570683). The integrator complex provides a quality checkpoint during transcription elongation by driving premature transcription termination of transcripts that are unfavorably configured for transcriptional elongation: the complex terminates transcription by (1) catalyzing dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II subunit POLR2A/RPB1 and SUPT5H/SPT5, (2) degrading the exiting nascent RNA transcript via endonuclease activity and (3) promoting the release of Pol II from bound DNA (PubMed:38570683). The integrator complex is also involved in terminating the synthesis of non-coding Pol II transcripts, such as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), telomerase RNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (PubMed:16239144). Mediates recruitment of cytoplasmic dynein to the nuclear envelope, probably as component of the integrator complex (PubMed:23904267).
