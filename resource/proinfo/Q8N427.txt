UniprotID	Q8N427
Accession	Q8N427;Q9NZH1
EntryName	TXND3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 3 (3'-5' exonuclease NME8) (EC 3.1.-.-) (NM23-H8) (NME/NM23 family member 8) (Spermatid-specific thioredoxin-2) (Sptrx-2)
GeneName	NME8 SPTRX2 TXNDC3
Length	588
Function	Probably required during the final stages of sperm tail maturation in the testis and/or epididymis, where extensive disulfide bonding of fibrous sheath (FS) proteins occurs. In vitro, it has neither nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity nor reducing activity on disulfide bonds (PubMed:11737268). Exhibits a 3'-5' exonuclease activity with a preference for single-stranded DNA, suggesting roles in DNA proofreading and repair (PubMed:16313181).
