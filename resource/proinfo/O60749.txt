EntryName	SNX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sorting nexin-2 (Transformation-related gene 9 protein) (TRG-9)
GeneName	SNX2 TRG9
Length	519
Function	Involved in several stages of intracellular trafficking. Interacts with membranes containing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3P)) or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) (PubMed:16179610). Acts in part as component of the retromer membrane-deforming SNX-BAR subcomplex (PubMed:17101778). The SNX-BAR retromer mediates retrograde transport of cargo proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is involved in endosome-to-plasma membrane transport for cargo protein recycling. The SNX-BAR subcomplex functions to deform the donor membrane into a tubular profile called endosome-to-TGN transport carrier (ETC) (Probable). Can sense membrane curvature and has in vitro vesicle-to-membrane remodeling activity (PubMed:23085988). Required for retrograde endosome-to-TGN transport of TGN38 (PubMed:20138391). Promotes KALRN- and RHOG-dependent but retromer-independent membrane remodeling such as lamellipodium formation; the function is dependent on GEF activity of KALRN (PubMed:20604901).
