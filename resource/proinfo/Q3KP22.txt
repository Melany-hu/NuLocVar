UniprotID	Q3KP22
Accession	Q3KP22;B3KS99;E9PPE5
EntryName	MAJIN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Membrane-anchored junction protein
GeneName	MAJIN C11orf85
Length	176
Function	Meiosis-specific telomere-associated protein involved in meiotic telomere attachment to the nucleus inner membrane, a crucial step for homologous pairing and synapsis. Component of the MAJIN-TERB1-TERB2 complex, which promotes telomere cap exchange by mediating attachment of telomeric DNA to the inner nuclear membrane and replacement of the protective cap of telomeric chromosomes: in early meiosis, the MAJIN-TERB1-TERB2 complex associates with telomeric DNA and the shelterin/telosome complex. During prophase, the complex matures and promotes release of the shelterin/telosome complex from telomeric DNA. In the complex, MAJIN acts as the anchoring subunit to the nucleus inner membrane. MAJIN shows DNA-binding activity, possibly for the stabilization of telomere attachment on the nucleus inner membrane.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus inner membrane; Chromosome; Telomere
