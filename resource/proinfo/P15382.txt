UniprotID	P15382
Accession	P15382;A5H1P2;Q8N709;Q91Z94
EntryName	KCNE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 1 (Delayed rectifier potassium channel subunit IsK) (IKs producing slow voltage-gated potassium channel subunit beta Mink) (Minimal potassium channel) (MinK)
GeneName	KCNE1
Length	129
Function	Ancillary protein that functions as a regulatory subunit of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel complex composed of pore-forming and potassium-conducting alpha subunits and of regulatory beta subunits. KCNE1 beta subunit modulates the gating kinetics and enhances stability of the channel complex (PubMed:19219384, PubMed:20533308, PubMed:9230439). Alters the gating of the delayed rectifier Kv channel containing KCNB1 alpha subunit (PubMed:19219384). Associates with KCNQ1/KVLQT1 alpha subunit to form the slowly activating delayed rectifier cardiac potassium (IKs) channel responsible for ventricular muscle action potential repolarization (PubMed:20533308). The outward current reaches its steady state only after 50 seconds (Probable). Assembly with KCNH2/HERG alpha subunit Kv channel may regulate the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifying potassium current (IKr) in heart (PubMed:9230439).
