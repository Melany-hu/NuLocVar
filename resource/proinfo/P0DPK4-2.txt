UniprotID	P0DPK4-2
Accession	P0DPK4;A0A494C1K9
EntryName	NT2NC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Notch homolog 2 N-terminal-like protein C
GeneName	NOTCH2NLC
Length	236
Function	Human-specific protein that promotes neural progenitor proliferation and evolutionary expansion of the brain neocortex by regulating the Notch signaling pathway (PubMed:29561261, PubMed:29856954, PubMed:29856955). Able to promote neural progenitor self-renewal, possibly by down-regulating neuronal differentiation genes, thereby delaying the differentiation of neuronal progenitors and leading to an overall final increase in neuronal production (PubMed:29856954). Acts by enhancing the Notch signaling pathway via two different mechanisms that probably work in parallel to reach the same effect (PubMed:29856954). Enhances Notch signaling pathway in a non-cell-autonomous manner via direct interaction with NOTCH2 (PubMed:29856954). Also promotes Notch signaling pathway in a cell-autonomous manner through inhibition of cis DLL1-NOTCH2 interactions, which promotes neuronal differentiation (By similarity).
