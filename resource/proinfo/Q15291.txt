Length	538
Function	In embryonic stem (ES) cells, plays a crucial role in the differentiation potential, particularly along the neural lineage, regulating gene induction and H3 'Lys-4' methylation at key developmental loci, including that mediated by retinoic acid (By similarity). Does not affect ES cell self-renewal (By similarity). Component or associated component of some histone methyltransferase complexes which regulates transcription through recruitment of those complexes to gene promoters (PubMed:19131338). As part of the MLL1/MLL complex, involved in mono-, di- and trimethylation at 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (PubMed:19556245). Histone H3 'Lys-4' methylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation (PubMed:19556245). In association with ASH2L and WDR5, stimulates the histone methyltransferase activities of KMT2A, KMT2B, KMT2C, KMT2D, SETD1A and SETD1B (PubMed:21220120, PubMed:22266653).
