UniprotID	Q01469
Accession	Q01469;B2R4K0
EntryName	FABP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fatty acid-binding protein 5 (Epidermal-type fatty acid-binding protein) (E-FABP) (Fatty acid-binding protein, epidermal) (Psoriasis-associated fatty acid-binding protein homolog) (PA-FABP)
GeneName	FABP5
Length	135
Function	Intracellular carrier for long-chain fatty acids and related active lipids, such as endocannabinoids, that regulate the metabolism and actions of the ligands they bind. In addition to the cytosolic transport, selectively delivers specific fatty acids from the cytosol to the nucleus, wherein they activate nuclear receptors (PubMed:21395585, PubMed:22170058). Delivers retinoic acid to the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta; which promotes proliferation and survival. May also serve as a synaptic carrier of endocannabinoid at central synapses and thus controls retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. Modulates inflammation by regulating PTGES induction via NF-kappa-B activation, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthesis during inflammation (By similarity). May be involved in keratinocyte differentiation (PubMed:8092987).
