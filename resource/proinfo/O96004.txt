UniprotID	O96004
Accession	O96004
EntryName	HAND1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heart- and neural crest derivatives-expressed protein 1 (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 27) (bHLHa27) (Extraembryonic tissues, heart, autonomic nervous system and neural crest derivatives-expressed protein 1) (eHAND)
GeneName	HAND1 BHLHA27 EHAND
Length	215
Function	Transcription factor that plays an essential role in both trophoblast giant cell differentiation and in cardiac morphogenesis (By similarity). Binds the DNA sequence 5'-NRTCTG-3' (non-canonical E-box) (By similarity). Acts as a transcriptional repressor of SOX15 (By similarity). In the adult, could be required for ongoing expression of cardiac-specific genes (PubMed:9931445).
