UniprotID	P60413
Accession	P60413;B2RPA3
EntryName	KR10C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 10-12 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.12) (Keratin-associated protein 10.12) (Keratin-associated protein 18-12) (Keratin-associated protein 18.12)
GeneName	KRTAP10-12 KAP10.12 KAP18-12 KRTAP10.12 KRTAP18-12 KRTAP18.12
Length	245
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
