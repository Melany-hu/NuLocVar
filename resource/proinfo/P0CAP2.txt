EntryName	GRL1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit GRINL1A (DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit M) (Glutamate receptor-like protein 1A)
GeneName	POLR2M GRINL1A
Length	368
Function	Appears to be a stable component of the Pol II(G) complex form of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Pol II synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs and is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. May play a role in the Mediator complex-dependent regulation of transcription activation. Acts as a negative regulator of transcriptional activation; this repression is relieved by the Mediator complex, which restores Pol II(G) activator-dependent transcription to a level equivalent to that of Pol II.
