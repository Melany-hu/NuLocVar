UniprotID	P27707
Accession	P27707;B2R8V6;Q5TZY7;Q6FI11
EntryName	DCK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) (EC 2.7.1.74) (Deoxyadenosine kinase) (EC 2.7.1.76) (Deoxyguanosine kinase) (EC 2.7.1.113)
GeneName	DCK
Length	260
Function	Phosphorylates the deoxyribonucleosides deoxycytidine, deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine (PubMed:12808445, PubMed:18377927, PubMed:19159229, PubMed:1996353, PubMed:20614893, PubMed:20637175). Has broad substrate specificity, and does not display selectivity based on the chirality of the substrate. It is also an essential enzyme for the phosphorylation of numerous nucleoside analogs widely employed as antiviral and chemotherapeutic agents (PubMed:12808445).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
