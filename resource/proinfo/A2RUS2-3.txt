UniprotID	A2RUS2-3
Accession	A2RUS2;B7ZM28;O94947;Q2TAM7;Q6ZMS6;Q96DK3
EntryName	DEND3_HUMAN
ProteinName	DENN domain-containing protein 3
GeneName	DENND3 KIAA0870
Length	266
Function	Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activating RAB12. Promotes the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting inactive GDP-bound RAB12 into its active GTP-bound form (PubMed:20937701). Regulates autophagy in response to starvation through RAB12 activation. Starvation leads to ULK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-472 and Ser-490, which in turn allows recruitment of 14-3-3 adapter proteins and leads to up-regulation of GEF activity towards RAB12 (By similarity). Also plays a role in protein transport from recycling endosomes to lysosomes, regulating, for instance, the degradation of the transferrin receptor and of the amino acid transporter PAT4 (PubMed:20937701). Starvation also induces phosphorylation at Tyr-858, which leads to up-regulated GEF activity and initiates autophagy (By similarity).
