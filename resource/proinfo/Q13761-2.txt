UniprotID	Q13761-2
Accession	Q13761;B1AJV5;Q12969;Q13760
EntryName	RUNX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Runt-related transcription factor 3 (Acute myeloid leukemia 2 protein) (Core-binding factor subunit alpha-3) (CBF-alpha-3) (Oncogene AML-2) (Polyomavirus enhancer-binding protein 2 alpha C subunit) (PEA2-alpha C) (PEBP2-alpha C) (SL3-3 enhancer factor 1 alpha C subunit) (SL3/AKV core-binding factor alpha C subunit)
GeneName	RUNX3 AML2 CBFA3 PEBP2A3
Length	429
Function	Forms the heterodimeric complex core-binding factor (CBF) with CBFB. RUNX members modulate the transcription of their target genes through recognizing the core consensus binding sequence 5'-TGTGGT-3', or very rarely, 5'-TGCGGT-3', within their regulatory regions via their runt domain, while CBFB is a non-DNA-binding regulatory subunit that allosterically enhances the sequence-specific DNA-binding capacity of RUNX. The heterodimers bind to the core site of a number of enhancers and promoters, including murine leukemia virus, polyomavirus enhancer, T-cell receptor enhancers, LCK, IL3 and GM-CSF promoters (By similarity). May be involved in the control of cellular proliferation and/or differentiation. In association with ZFHX3, up-regulates CDKN1A promoter activity following TGF-beta stimulation (PubMed:20599712). CBF complexes repress ZBTB7B transcription factor during cytotoxic (CD8+) T cell development. They bind to RUNX-binding sequence within the ZBTB7B locus acting as transcriptional silencer and allowing for cytotoxic T cell differentiation. CBF complexes binding to the transcriptional silencer is essential for recruitment of nuclear protein complexes that catalyze epigenetic modifications to establish epigenetic ZBTB7B silencing (By similarity).
