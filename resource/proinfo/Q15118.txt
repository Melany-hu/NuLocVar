Accession	Q15118;B2R6T1;B7Z937;D3DPD8;E9PD65;Q308M4
EntryName	PDK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	[Pyruvate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)] kinase isozyme 1, mitochondrial (EC 2.7.11.2) (Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 1) (PDH kinase 1)
GeneName	PDK1 PDHK1
Length	436
Function	Kinase that plays a key role in regulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism and homeostasis via phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase subunits PDHA1 and PDHA2 (PubMed:7499431, PubMed:18541534, PubMed:22195962, PubMed:26942675, PubMed:17683942). This inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, and thereby regulates metabolite flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, down-regulates aerobic respiration and inhibits the formation of acetyl-coenzyme A from pyruvate (PubMed:18541534, PubMed:22195962, PubMed:26942675). Plays an important role in cellular responses to hypoxia and is important for cell proliferation under hypoxia (PubMed:18541534, PubMed:22195962, PubMed:26942675).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
