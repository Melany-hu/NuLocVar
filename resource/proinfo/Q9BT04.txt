UniprotID	Q9BT04
Accession	Q9BT04;B2RD86;B5MDH0;Q6PJY0;Q9H613
EntryName	FUZZY_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein fuzzy homolog
GeneName	FUZ FY
Length	418
Function	Probable planar cell polarity effector involved in cilium biogenesis. May regulate protein and membrane transport to the cilium. Proposed to function as core component of the CPLANE (ciliogenesis and planar polarity effectors) complex involved in the recruitment of peripheral IFT-A proteins to basal bodies. May regulate the morphogenesis of hair follicles which depends on functional primary cilia. Binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate with highest affinity, followed by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium basal body
