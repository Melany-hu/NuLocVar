UniprotID	P11836
Accession	P11836;A6NMS4;B4DT24;P08984;Q13963
EntryName	CD20_HUMAN
ProteinName	B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 (B-lymphocyte surface antigen B1) (Bp35) (Leukocyte surface antigen Leu-16) (Membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A member 1) (CD antigen CD20)
GeneName	MS4A1 CD20
Length	297
Function	B-lymphocyte-specific membrane protein that plays a role in the regulation of cellular calcium influx necessary for the development, differentiation, and activation of B-lymphocytes (PubMed:12920111, PubMed:3925015, PubMed:7684739). Functions as a store-operated calcium (SOC) channel component promoting calcium influx after activation by the B-cell receptor/BCR (PubMed:12920111, PubMed:18474602, PubMed:7684739).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell membrane
