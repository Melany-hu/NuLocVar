Function	Substrate adapter of E3 ligase complexes mediating ufmylation, the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like modifier UFM1 to substrate proteins, and which is involved in various processes, such as ribosome recycling and reticulophagy (also called ER-phagy) (PubMed:23152784, PubMed:30635284, PubMed:32851973, PubMed:36121123, PubMed:36543799, PubMed:37595036, PubMed:38383785, PubMed:38383789). As part of the UREL complex, plays a key role in ribosome recycling by promoting mono-ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 subunit of the 60S ribosome (PubMed:38383785, PubMed:38383789). Ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 occurs on free 60S ribosomes following ribosome dissociation: it weakens the junction between post-termination 60S subunits and SEC61 translocons, promoting release and recycling of the large ribosomal subunit from the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (PubMed:38383785, PubMed:38383789). Ufmylation of RPL26/uL24 and subsequent 60S ribosome recycling either take place after normal termination of translation or after ribosome stalling during cotranslational translocation at the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:32851973, PubMed:37595036, PubMed:38383785, PubMed:38383789). Within the UREL complex, CDK5RAP3 acts as a substrate adapter that constrains UFL1 ligase activity to mono-ufmylate RPL26/uL24 at 'Lys-134' (PubMed:36121123, PubMed:38383785, PubMed:38383789). The UREL complex is also involved in reticulophagy in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress by promoting ufmylation of proteins such as CYB5R3, thereby promoting lysosomal degradation of ufmylated proteins (PubMed:36543799). Also acts as a regulator of transcription: negatively regulates NF-kappa-B-mediated gene transcription through the control of RELA phosphorylation (PubMed:17785205, PubMed:20228063). Also regulates mitotic G2/M transition checkpoint and mitotic G2 DNA damage checkpoint (PubMed:15790566, PubMed:19223857). Through its interaction with CDKN2A/ARF and MDM2 may induce MDM2-dependent p53/TP53 ubiquitination, stabilization and activation in the nucleus, thereby promoting G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibition of cell proliferation (PubMed:16173922). May also play a role in the rupture of the nuclear envelope during apoptosis (PubMed:23478299). May regulate MAPK14 activity by regulating its dephosphorylation by PPM1D/WIP1 (PubMed:21283629). Required for liver development (By similarity).
