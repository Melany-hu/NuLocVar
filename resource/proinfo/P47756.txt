UniprotID	P47756
Accession	P47756;Q32Q68;Q5U0L4;Q8TB49;Q9NUC4
EntryName	CAPZB_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-actin-capping protein subunit beta (CapZ beta)
GeneName	CAPZB
Length	272
Function	F-actin-capping proteins bind in a Ca(2+)-independent manner to the fast growing ends of actin filaments (barbed end) thereby blocking the exchange of subunits at these ends. Unlike other capping proteins (such as gelsolin and severin), these proteins do not sever actin filaments. Plays a role in the regulation of cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization. Forms, with CAPZB, the barbed end of the fast growing ends of actin filaments in the dynactin complex and stabilizes dynactin structure. The dynactin multiprotein complex activates the molecular motor dynein for ultra-processive transport along microtubules (By similarity).
