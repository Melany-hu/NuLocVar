UniprotID	Q9NPB3
Accession	Q9NPB3
EntryName	CABP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium-binding protein 2 (CaBP2)
GeneName	CABP2
Length	220
Function	Required for sound encoding at inner hair cells (IHCs) synapses, likely via inhibition of the inactivation of voltage-gated calcium channel of type 1.3 (Cav1.3) in the IHCs (PubMed:28183797). Required for the normal transfer of light signals through the retina (By similarity).
