EntryName	NEP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase NEP1 (EC 2.1.1.-) (18S rRNA (pseudouridine(1248)-N1)-methyltransferase) (18S rRNA Psi1248 methyltransferase) (Nucleolar protein EMG1 homolog) (Protein C2f) (Ribosome biogenesis protein NEP1)
GeneName	EMG1 C2F
Length	244
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent pseudouridine N(1)-methyltransferase that methylates pseudouridine at position 1248 (Psi1248) in 18S rRNA. Involved the biosynthesis of the hypermodified N1-methyl-N3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) pseudouridine (m1acp3-Psi) conserved in eukaryotic 18S rRNA. Is not able to methylate uridine at this position (PubMed:20047967). Also has an essential role in 40S ribosomal subunit biogenesis independent on its methyltransferase activity, facilitating the incorporation of ribosomal protein S19 during the formation of pre-ribosomes (By similarity). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
