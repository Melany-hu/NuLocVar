EntryName	5HT1D_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1D (5-HT-1D) (5-HT1D) (Serotonin 1D alpha receptor) (5-HT-1D-alpha) (Serotonin receptor 1D)
GeneName	HTR1D HTR1DA HTRL
Length	377
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (PubMed:10452531, PubMed:1565658, PubMed:1652050, PubMed:33762731). Also functions as a receptor for ergot alkaloid derivatives, various anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs and other psychoactive substances (PubMed:10452531, PubMed:1565658, PubMed:1652050, PubMed:33762731). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase (PubMed:10452531, PubMed:1565658, PubMed:1652050, PubMed:33762731). HTR1D is coupled to G(i)/G(o) G alpha proteins and mediates inhibitory neurotransmission by inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity (PubMed:33762731). Regulates the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain, and thereby affects neural activity (PubMed:18476671, PubMed:20945968). May also play a role in regulating the release of other neurotransmitters (PubMed:18476671, PubMed:20945968). May play a role in vasoconstriction (PubMed:18476671, PubMed:20945968).
