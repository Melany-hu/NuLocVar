EntryName	PPCS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphopantothenate--cysteine ligase (EC 6.3.2.51) (Phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase) (PPC synthetase)
GeneName	PPCS COAB
Length	311
Function	Catalyzes the second step in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A from vitamin B5, where cysteine is conjugated to 4'-phosphopantothenate to form 4-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PubMed:11923312, PubMed:12906824, PubMed:29754768). Has a preference for ATP over CTP as a cosubstrate (PubMed:11923312).
