EntryName	GLYM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine hydroxymethyltransferase, mitochondrial (SHMT) (EC 2.1.2.1) (Glycine hydroxymethyltransferase) (Serine methylase)
GeneName	SHMT2
Length	504
Function	Catalyzes the cleavage of serine to glycine accompanied with the production of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, an essential intermediate for purine biosynthesis (PubMed:24075985, PubMed:25619277, PubMed:29364879, PubMed:33015733). Serine provides the major source of folate one-carbon in cells by catalyzing the transfer of one carbon from serine to tetrahydrofolate (PubMed:25619277). Contributes to the de novo mitochondrial thymidylate biosynthesis pathway via its role in glycine and tetrahydrofolate metabolism: thymidylate biosynthesis is required to prevent uracil accumulation in mtDNA (PubMed:21876188). Also required for mitochondrial translation by producing 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate; 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate providing methyl donors to produce the taurinomethyluridine base at the wobble position of some mitochondrial tRNAs (PubMed:29364879, PubMed:29452640). Associates with mitochondrial DNA (PubMed:18063578). In addition to its role in mitochondria, also plays a role in the deubiquitination of target proteins as component of the BRISC complex: required for IFNAR1 deubiquitination by the BRISC complex (PubMed:24075985).
