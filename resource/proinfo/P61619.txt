EntryName	S61A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein transport protein Sec61 subunit alpha isoform 1 (Sec61 alpha-1)
GeneName	SEC61A1 SEC61A
Length	476
Function	Component of SEC61 channel-forming translocon complex that mediates transport of signal peptide-containing precursor polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (PubMed:12475939, PubMed:22375059, PubMed:28782633, PubMed:29719251, PubMed:32814900). Forms a ribosome receptor and a gated pore in the ER membrane, both functions required for cotranslational translocation of nascent polypeptides (PubMed:22375059, PubMed:28782633, PubMed:29719251). May cooperate with auxiliary protein SEC62, SEC63 and HSPA5/BiP to enable post-translational transport of small presecretory proteins (PubMed:22375059, PubMed:29719251). The SEC61 channel is also involved in ER membrane insertion of transmembrane proteins: it mediates membrane insertion of the first few transmembrane segments of proteins, while insertion of subsequent transmembrane regions of multi-pass membrane proteins is mediated by the multi-pass translocon (MPT) complex (PubMed:32820719, PubMed:36261522). The SEC61 channel cooperates with the translocating protein TRAM1 to import nascent proteins into the ER (PubMed:8616892). Controls the passive efflux of calcium ions from the ER lumen to the cytosol through SEC61 channel, contributing to the maintenance of cellular calcium homeostasis (PubMed:28782633). Plays a critical role in nephrogenesis, specifically at pronephros stage (By similarity).
