UniprotID	Q8TCW9
Accession	Q8TCW9;A5JUU2;Q53QT9;Q8NFJ7
EntryName	PKR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prokineticin receptor 1 (PK-R1) (G-protein coupled receptor 73) (G-protein coupled receptor ZAQ) (GPR73a)
GeneName	PROKR1 GPR73 PKR1
Length	393
Function	Receptor for prokineticin 1. Exclusively coupled to the G(q) subclass of heteromeric G proteins. Activation leads to mobilization of calcium, stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover and activation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase. May play a role during early pregnancy.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
