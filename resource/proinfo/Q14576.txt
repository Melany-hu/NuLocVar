UniprotID	Q14576
Accession	Q14576;Q16135;Q96CL8;Q96QS9
EntryName	ELAV3_HUMAN
ProteinName	ELAV-like protein 3 (Hu-antigen C) (HuC) (Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration-associated antigen) (Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis antigen 21)
GeneName	ELAVL3 HUC PLE21
Length	367
Function	RNA-binding protein that binds to AU-rich element (ARE) sequences of target mRNAs, including VEGF mRNA (PubMed:10710437). May also bind poly-A tracts via RRM 3 (By similarity). May be involved in neuronal differentiation and maintenance (By similarity). Plays a role in the stabilization of GAP43 mRNA and in spatial learning (By similarity).
