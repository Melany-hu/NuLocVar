EntryName	AK1BA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (EC 1.1.1.300) (EC 1.1.1.54) (ARL-1) (Aldose reductase-like) (Aldose reductase-related protein) (ARP) (hARP) (Small intestine reductase) (SI reductase)
GeneName	AKR1B10 AKR1B11
Length	316
Function	Catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a wide variety of carbonyl-containing compounds to their corresponding alcohols (PubMed:12732097, PubMed:18087047, PubMed:19013440, PubMed:19563777, PubMed:9565553). Displays strong enzymatic activity toward all-trans-retinal, 9-cis-retinal, and 13-cis-retinal (PubMed:12732097, PubMed:18087047). Plays a critical role in detoxifying dietary and lipid-derived unsaturated carbonyls, such as crotonaldehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, trans-2-hexenal, trans-2,4-hexadienal and their glutathione-conjugates carbonyls (GS-carbonyls) (PubMed:19013440, PubMed:19563777). Displays no reductase activity towards glucose (PubMed:12732097).
