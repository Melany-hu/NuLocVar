UniprotID	Q9UKI2
Accession	Q9UKI2;B2R8S0;O95353;Q9UQJ0
EntryName	BORG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cdc42 effector protein 3 (Binder of Rho GTPases 2) (MSE55-related Cdc42-binding protein)
GeneName	CDC42EP3 BORG2 CEP3
Length	254
Function	Probably involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. May act downstream of CDC42 to induce actin filament assembly leading to cell shape changes. Induces pseudopodia formation in fibroblasts.
