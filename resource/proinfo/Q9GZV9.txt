UniprotID	Q9GZV9
Accession	Q9GZV9;Q4V758
EntryName	FGF23_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) (Phosphatonin) (Tumor-derived hypophosphatemia-inducing factor) [Cleaved into: Fibroblast growth factor 23 N-terminal peptide; Fibroblast growth factor 23 C-terminal peptide]
GeneName	FGF23 HYPF UNQ3027/PRO9828
Length	251
Function	Regulator of phosphate homeostasis (PubMed:11062477). Inhibits renal tubular phosphate transport by reducing SLC34A1 levels (PubMed:11409890). Up-regulates EGR1 expression in the presence of KL (By similarity). Acts directly on the parathyroid to decrease PTH secretion (By similarity). Regulator of vitamin-D metabolism (PubMed:15040831). Negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization (PubMed:18282132).
