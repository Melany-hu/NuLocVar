UniprotID	P16083
Accession	P16083;B2R492;Q5TD04
EntryName	NQO2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosyldihydronicotinamide dehydrogenase [quinone] (EC 1.10.5.1) (NRH dehydrogenase [quinone] 2) (NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2) (Quinone reductase 2) (QR2)
GeneName	NQO2 NMOR2
Length	231
Function	The enzyme apparently serves as a quinone reductase in connection with conjugation reactions of hydroquinones involved in detoxification pathways as well as in biosynthetic processes such as the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation of glutamate residues in prothrombin synthesis.
