UniprotID	Q6NXT6
Accession	Q6NXT6;Q8N2S3;Q9NZK9
EntryName	TAPT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane anterior posterior transformation protein 1 homolog (Cytomegalovirus partial fusion receptor)
GeneName	TAPT1 CMVFR
Length	567
Function	Plays a role in primary cilia formation (PubMed:26365339). May act as a downstream effector of HOXC8 possibly by transducing or transmitting extracellular information required for axial skeletal patterning during development (By similarity). May be involved in cartilage and bone development (By similarity). May play a role in the differentiation of cranial neural crest cells (By similarity).
