UniprotID	P01127
Accession	P01127;G3XAG8;P78431;Q15354;Q6FHE7;Q9UF23
EntryName	PDGFB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Platelet-derived growth factor subunit B (PDGF subunit B) (PDGF-2) (Platelet-derived growth factor B chain) (Platelet-derived growth factor beta polypeptide) (Proto-oncogene c-Sis) (Becaplermin)
GeneName	PDGFB PDGF2 SIS
Length	241
Function	Growth factor that plays an essential role in the regulation of embryonic development, cell proliferation, cell migration, survival and chemotaxis. Potent mitogen for cells of mesenchymal origin (PubMed:26599395). Required for normal proliferation and recruitment of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells in the central nervous system, skin, lung, heart and placenta. Required for normal blood vessel development, and for normal development of kidney glomeruli. Plays an important role in wound healing. Signaling is modulated by the formation of heterodimers with PDGFA (By similarity).
