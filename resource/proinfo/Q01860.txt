EntryName	PO5F1_HUMAN
ProteinName	POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1 (Octamer-binding protein 3) (Oct-3) (Octamer-binding protein 4) (Oct-4) (Octamer-binding transcription factor 3) (OTF-3)
GeneName	POU5F1 OCT3 OCT4 OTF3
Length	360
Function	Transcription factor that binds to the octamer motif (5'-ATTTGCAT-3'). Forms a trimeric complex with SOX2 or SOX15 on DNA and controls the expression of a number of genes involved in embryonic development such as YES1, FGF4, UTF1 and ZFP206. Critical for early embryogenesis and for embryonic stem cell pluripotency.
