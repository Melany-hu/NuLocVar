EntryName	RDH12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinol dehydrogenase 12 (EC 1.1.1.300) (All-trans and 9-cis retinol dehydrogenase) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 7C member 2)
GeneName	RDH12 SDR7C2
Length	316
Function	Retinoids dehydrogenase/reductase with a clear preference for NADP. Displays high activity towards 9-cis, 11-cis and all-trans-retinal. Shows very weak activity towards 13-cis-retinol (PubMed:12226107, PubMed:15865448). Also exhibits activity, albeit with lower affinity than for retinaldehydes, towards lipid peroxidation products (C9 aldehydes) such as 4-hydroxynonenal and trans-2-nonenal (PubMed:15865448, PubMed:19686838). May play an important function in photoreceptor cells to detoxify 4-hydroxynonenal and potentially other toxic aldehyde products resulting from lipid peroxidation (PubMed:19686838). Has no dehydrogenase activity towards steroids (PubMed:12226107, PubMed:15865448).
