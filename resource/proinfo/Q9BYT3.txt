UniprotID	Q9BYT3
Accession	Q9BYT3;Q658S6;Q8NEF5
EntryName	STK33_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase 33 (EC 2.7.11.1)
GeneName	STK33
Length	514
Function	Serine/threonine protein kinase required for spermatid differentiation and male fertility (PubMed:37146716, PubMed:38781365). Promotes sperm flagella assembly during spermatogenesis by mediating phosphorylation of fibrous sheath proteins AKAP3 and AKAP4 (By similarity). Also phosphorylates vimentin/VIM, thereby regulating the dynamic behavior of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton (By similarity).
