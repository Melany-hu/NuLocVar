UniprotID	Q9NYW4
Accession	Q9NYW4;Q645W0;Q75MV7
EntryName	TA2R5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 5 (T2R5)
GeneName	TAS2R5
Length	299
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
