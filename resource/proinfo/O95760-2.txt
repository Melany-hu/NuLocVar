UniprotID	O95760-2
Accession	O95760;B2R8L1;B4DJ35;B4E1Q9;D3DRI5;E7EAX4;Q2YEJ5
EntryName	IL33_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-33 (IL-33) (Interleukin-1 family member 11) (IL-1F11) (Nuclear factor from high endothelial venules) (NF-HEV) [Cleaved into: Interleukin-33 (95-270); Interleukin-33 (99-270); Interleukin-33 (109-270)]
GeneName	IL33 C9orf26 IL1F11 NFHEV
Length	228
Function	Cytokine that binds to and signals through the IL1RL1/ST2 receptor which in turn activates NF-kappa-B and MAPK signaling pathways in target cells (PubMed:16286016, PubMed:19841166). Involved in the maturation of Th2 cells inducing the secretion of T-helper type 2-associated cytokines (PubMed:17853410, PubMed:18836528). Also involved in activation of mast cells, basophils, eosinophils and natural killer cells (PubMed:17853410, PubMed:18836528). Acts as an enhancer of polarization of alternatively activated macrophages (PubMed:19841166). Acts as a chemoattractant for Th2 cells, and may function as an 'alarmin', that amplifies immune responses during tissue injury (PubMed:17853410, PubMed:18836528). Induces rapid UCP2-dependent mitochondrial rewiring that attenuates the generation of reactive oxygen species and preserves the integrity of Krebs cycle required for persistent production of itaconate and subsequent GATA3-dependent differentiation of inflammation-resolving alternatively activated macrophages (By similarity).
