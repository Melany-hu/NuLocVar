UniprotID	P33778
Accession	P33778;Q4KN36
EntryName	H2B1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type 1-B (H2B-clustered histone 3) (Histone H2B.1) (Histone H2B.f) (H2B/f)
GeneName	H2BC3 H2BFF HIST1H2BB
Length	126
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
