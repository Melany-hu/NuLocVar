EntryName	MYZAP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myocardial zonula adherens protein (GRINL1A upstream protein) (Gup)
GeneName	MYZAP MYOZAP
Length	466
Function	Plays a role in cellular signaling via Rho-related GTP-binding proteins and subsequent activation of transcription factor SRF (By similarity). Targets TJP1 to cell junctions. In cortical neurons, may play a role in glutaminergic signal transduction through interaction with the NMDA receptor subunit GRIN1 (By similarity).
