UniprotID	Q96LA6
Accession	Q96LA6;B2RE05;Q8N759;Q8NDI0;Q96PJ6
EntryName	FCRL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fc receptor-like protein 1 (FcR-like protein 1) (FcRL1) (Fc receptor homolog 1) (FcRH1) (IFGP family protein 1) (hIFGP1) (Immune receptor translocation-associated protein 5) (CD antigen CD307a)
GeneName	FCRL1 FCRH1 IFGP1 IRTA5
Length	429
Function	Type I transmembrane surface glycoprotein preferentially expressed by B-cells that regulates BCR-mediated signaling responses (PubMed:15479727). Recruits ABL1 as the intracellular effector molecule to enhance B-cell activation (By similarity). Also plays a negative role by suppressing ERK activation under homeostatic and BCR-stimulated conditions in a GRB2-dependent manner (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
