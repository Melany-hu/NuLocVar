UniprotID	Q13829
Accession	Q13829;B7Z6M4;Q5TZQ1
EntryName	BACD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	BTB/POZ domain-containing adapter for CUL3-mediated RhoA degradation protein 2 (hBACURD2) (BTB/POZ domain-containing protein TNFAIP1) (Protein B12) (Tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 1, endothelial)
GeneName	TNFAIP1 BACURD2 EDP1
Length	316
Function	Substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex involved in regulation of cytoskeleton structure. The BCR(TNFAIP1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex mediates the ubiquitination of RHOA, leading to its degradation by the proteasome, thereby regulating the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. Its interaction with RHOB may regulate apoptosis. May enhance the PCNA-dependent DNA polymerase delta activity.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Endosome
