EntryName	CENPU_HUMAN
ProteinName	Centromere protein U (CENP-U) (Centromere protein of 50 kDa) (CENP-50) (Interphase centromere complex protein 24) (KSHV latent nuclear antigen-interacting protein 1) (MLF1-interacting protein) (Polo-box-interacting protein 1)
GeneName	CENPU ICEN24 KLIP1 MLF1IP PBIP1
Length	418
Function	Component of the CENPA-NAC (nucleosome-associated) complex, a complex that plays a central role in assembly of kinetochore proteins, mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. The CENPA-NAC complex recruits the CENPA-CAD (nucleosome distal) complex and may be involved in incorporation of newly synthesized CENPA into centromeres. Plays an important role in the correct PLK1 localization to the mitotic kinetochores. A scaffold protein responsible for the initial recruitment and maintenance of the kinetochore PLK1 population until its degradation. Involved in transcriptional repression.
