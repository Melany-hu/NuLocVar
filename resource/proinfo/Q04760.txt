UniprotID	Q04760
Accession	Q04760;B2R6P7;B4DDV0;P78375;Q59EL0;Q5TZW3;Q96FC0;Q96J41
EntryName	LGUL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lactoylglutathione lyase (EC 4.4.1.5) (Aldoketomutase) (Glyoxalase I) (Glx I) (Ketone-aldehyde mutase) (Methylglyoxalase) (S-D-lactoylglutathione methylglyoxal lyase)
GeneName	GLO1
Length	184
Function	Catalyzes the conversion of hemimercaptal, formed from methylglyoxal and glutathione, to S-lactoylglutathione (PubMed:20454679, PubMed:23122816, PubMed:9705294). Involved in the regulation of TNF-induced transcriptional activity of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:19199007). Required for normal osteoclastogenesis (By similarity).
