UniprotID	Q0VG99
Accession	Q0VG99;Q7RTU2
EntryName	MESP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mesoderm posterior protein 2 (Class C basic helix-loop-helix protein 6) (bHLHc6)
GeneName	MESP2 BHLHC6 SCDO2
Length	397
Function	Transcription factor with important role in somitogenesis. Defines the rostrocaudal patterning of the somite by participating in distinct Notch pathways. Also regulates the FGF signaling pathway. Specifies the rostral half of the somites. Generates rostro-caudal polarity of somites by down-regulating in the presumptive rostral domain DLL1, a Notch ligand. Participates in the segment border formation by activating in the anterior presomitic mesoderm LFNG, a negative regulator of DLL1-Notch signaling. Acts as a strong suppressor of Notch activity. Together with MESP1 is involved in the epithelialization of somitic mesoderm and in the development of cardiac mesoderm.
