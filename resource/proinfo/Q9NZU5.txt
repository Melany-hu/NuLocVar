UniprotID	Q9NZU5
Accession	Q9NZU5;B4DG80
EntryName	LMCD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	LIM and cysteine-rich domains protein 1 (Dyxin)
GeneName	LMCD1
Length	365
Function	Transcriptional cofactor that restricts GATA6 function by inhibiting DNA-binding, resulting in repression of GATA6 transcriptional activation of downstream target genes. Represses GATA6-mediated trans activation of lung- and cardiac tissue-specific promoters. Inhibits DNA-binding by GATA4 and GATA1 to the cTNC promoter (By similarity). Plays a critical role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy via activation of calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells signaling pathway.
