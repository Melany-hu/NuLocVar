UniprotID	Q99608
Accession	Q99608;B2R6Z5
EntryName	NECD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Necdin
GeneName	NDN
Length	321
Function	Growth suppressor that facilitates the entry of the cell into cell cycle arrest. Functionally similar to the retinoblastoma protein it binds to and represses the activity of cell-cycle-promoting proteins such as SV40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1A, and the transcription factor E2F. Necdin also interacts with p53 and works in an additive manner to inhibit cell growth. Also functions as a transcription factor and directly binds to specific guanosine-rich DNA sequences (By similarity).
