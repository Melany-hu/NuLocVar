UniprotID	Q8N7A1
Accession	Q8N7A1;B3KXD9;Q8WYI1
EntryName	KLDC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kelch domain-containing protein 1
GeneName	KLHDC1 MSTP025
Length	406
Function	Substrate-recognition component of a Cul5-RING (CRL5) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex of the DesCEND (destruction via C-end degrons) pathway, which recognizes a C-degron located at the extreme C terminus of target proteins, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:32200094). The C-degron recognized by the DesCEND pathway is usually a motif of less than ten residues and can be present in full-length proteins, truncated proteins or proteolytically cleaved forms (PubMed:32200094). The CRL5(KLHDC1) complex mediates ubiquitination and degradation of truncated SELENOS selenoprotein produced by failed UGA/Sec decoding, which ends with a glycine (PubMed:32200094).
