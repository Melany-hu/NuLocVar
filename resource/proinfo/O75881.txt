EntryName	CP7B1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 7B1 (24-hydroxycholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase) (EC 1.14.14.26) (25/26-hydroxycholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase) (EC 1.14.14.29) (3-hydroxysteroid 7-alpha hydroxylase) (Oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase)
GeneName	CYP7B1
Length	506
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of endogenous oxysterols and steroid hormones, including neurosteroids (PubMed:10588945, PubMed:24491228). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR; NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:10588945, PubMed:24491228). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon hydrogen bonds of steroids with a preference for 7-alpha position (PubMed:10588945, PubMed:24491228). Usually metabolizes steroids carrying a hydroxy group at position 3, functioning as a 3-hydroxy steroid 7-alpha hydroxylase (PubMed:24491228). Hydroxylates oxysterols, including 25-hydroxycholesterol and (25R)-cholest-5-ene-3beta,26-diol toward 7-alpha hydroxy derivatives, which may be transported to the liver and converted to bile acids (PubMed:10588945, PubMed:9802883). Via its product 7-alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol, a ligand for the chemotactic G protein-coupled receptor GPR183/EBI2, regulates B cell migration in germinal centers of lymphoid organs, thus guiding efficient maturation of plasma B cells and overall antigen-specific humoral immune response (By similarity). 7-alpha hydroxylates neurosteroids, including 3beta-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one (dehydroepiandrosterone) and pregnenolone, both involved in hippocampus-associated memory and learning (PubMed:24491228). Metabolizes androstanoids toward 6- or 7-alpha hydroxy derivatives (PubMed:24491228).
