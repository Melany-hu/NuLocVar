UniprotID	Q96AH8
Accession	Q96AH8
EntryName	RAB7B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-7b
GeneName	RAB7B
Length	199
Function	Controls vesicular trafficking from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Acts as a negative regulator of TLR9 signaling and can suppress TLR9-triggered TNFA, IL6, and IFNB production in macrophages by promoting TLR9 lysosomal degradation. Also negatively regulates TLR4 signaling in macrophages by promoting lysosomal degradation of TLR4. Promotes megakaryocytic differentiation by increasing NF-kappa-B-dependent IL6 production and subsequently enhancing the association of STAT3 with GATA1. Not involved in the regulation of the EGF- and EGFR degradation pathway.
Subcellular Location	Late endosome; Lysosome; Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Phagosome; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Phagosome membrane
