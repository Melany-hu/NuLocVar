UniprotID	Q9NZQ0
Accession	Q9NZQ0;Q5JV88;Q86Y24
EntryName	DJC27_HUMAN
ProteinName	DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 27 (Rab and DnaJ domain-containing protein)
GeneName	DNAJC27 RABJS RBJ
Length	273
Function	GTPase which can activate the MEK/ERK pathway and induce cell transformation when overexpressed. May act as a nuclear scaffold for MAPK1, probably by association with MAPK1 nuclear export signal leading to enhanced ERK1/ERK2 signaling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
