UniprotID	P05305
Accession	P05305;Q96DA1
EntryName	EDN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endothelin-1 (Preproendothelin-1) (PPET1) [Cleaved into: Endothelin-1 (ET-1); Big endothelin-1]
GeneName	EDN1
Length	212
Function	Endothelins are endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor peptides (By similarity). Probable ligand for G-protein coupled receptors EDNRA and EDNRB which activates PTK2B, BCAR1, BCAR3 and, GTPases RAP1 and RHOA cascade in glomerular mesangial cells (PubMed:19086031). Also binds the DEAR/FBXW7-AS1 receptor (PubMed:17446437). Promotes mesenteric arterial wall remodeling via activation of ROCK signaling and subsequent colocalization of NFATC3 with F-actin filaments (By similarity). NFATC3 then translocates to the nucleus where it subsequently promotes the transcription of the smooth muscle hypertrophy and differentiation marker ACTA2 (By similarity).
