EntryName	UBE3D_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase E3D (EC 2.3.2.26) (HECT-type E3 ubiquitin transferase E3D) (UbcH10-binding protein with a HECT-like domain) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2C-binding protein)
GeneName	UBE3D C6orf157 H10BH UBE2CBP
Length	389
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which accepts ubiquitin from specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and transfers it to substrates, generally promoting their degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:15749827). Independently of its E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity, acts as an inhibitor of CPSF3 endonuclease activity by blocking CPSF3 active site (PubMed:39032490).
