UniprotID	Q9NUL7
Accession	Q9NUL7
EntryName	DDX28_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX28 (EC 3.6.4.13) (Mitochondrial DEAD box protein 28)
GeneName	DDX28 MDDX28
Length	540
Function	Plays an essential role in facilitating the proper assembly of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit and its helicase activity is essential for this function (PubMed:25683708, PubMed:25683715). May be involved in RNA processing or transport. Has RNA and Mg(2+)-dependent ATPase activity (PubMed:11350955).
