EntryName	OPN4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Melanopsin (Opsin-4)
GeneName	OPN4 MOP
Length	478
Function	Photoreceptor that binds cis-retinaldehydes (PubMed:15674244). Contributes to pupillar reflex, photoentrainment and other non-image forming responses to light (By similarity). May be involved in the optokinetic visual tracking response (By similarity). May be involved in the regulation of retinal hyaloid vessel growth and regression (By similarity).
