UniprotID	P56703
Accession	P56703;Q2M237;Q9H1J9
EntryName	WNT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proto-oncogene Wnt-3 (Proto-oncogene Int-4 homolog)
GeneName	WNT3 INT4
Length	355
Function	Ligand for members of the frizzled family of seven transmembrane receptors (Probable). Functions in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway that results in activation of transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family (PubMed:26902720). Required for normal gastrulation, formation of the primitive streak, and for the formation of the mesoderm during early embryogenesis. Required for normal formation of the apical ectodermal ridge (By similarity). Required for normal embryonic development, and especially for limb development (PubMed:14872406).
