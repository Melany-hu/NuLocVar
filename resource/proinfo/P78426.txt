UniprotID	P78426
Accession	P78426
EntryName	NKX61_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein Nkx-6.1 (Homeobox protein NK-6 homolog A)
GeneName	NKX6-1 NKX6A
Length	367
Function	Transcription factor which binds to specific A/T-rich DNA sequences in the promoter regions of a number of genes. Involved in the development of insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans at the secondary transition (By similarity). Together with NKX2-2 and IRX3 acts to restrict the generation of motor neurons to the appropriate region of the neural tube. Belongs to the class II proteins of neuronal progenitor factors, which are induced by SHH signals (By similarity).
