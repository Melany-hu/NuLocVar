EntryName	PLA1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholipase A1 member A (EC 3.1.1.111) (Phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1) (PS-PLA1)
GeneName	PLA1A NMD PSPLA1
Length	456
Function	Hydrolyzes the ester bond of the acyl group attached at the sn-1 position of phosphatidylserines (phospholipase A1 activity) and 1-acyl-2-lysophosphatidylserines (lysophospholipase activity) in the pathway of phosphatidylserines acyl chain remodeling (PubMed:10196188). Cleaves phosphatidylserines exposed on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells producing 2-acyl-1-lysophosphatidylserines, which in turn enhance mast cell activation and histamine production (By similarity). Has no activity toward other glycerophospholipids including phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidic acids or phosphatidylinositols, or glycerolipids such as triolein (By similarity).
