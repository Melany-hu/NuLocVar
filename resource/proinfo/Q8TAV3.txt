EntryName	CP2W1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 2W1 (EC 1.14.14.-) (CYPIIW1)
GeneName	CYP2W1
Length	490
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that may play a role in retinoid and phospholipid metabolism (PubMed:22591743, PubMed:26936974). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of saturated carbon hydrogen bonds. Hydroxylates all trans-retinoic acid (atRA) to 4-hydroxyretinoate and may regulate atRA clearance. Other retinoids such as all-trans retinol and all-trans retinal are potential endogenous substrates (PubMed:26936974). Catalyzes both epoxidation of double bonds and hydroxylation of carbon hydrogen bonds of the fatty acyl chain of 1-acylphospholipids/2-lysophospholipids. Can metabolize various lysophospholipids classes including lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), lysophosphatidylinositols (LPIs), lysophosphatidylserines (LPSs), lysophosphatidylglycerols (LPGs), lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPEs) and lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) (PubMed:22591743). Has low or no activity toward 2-acylphospholipids/1-lysophospholipids, diacylphospholipids and free fatty acids (PubMed:22591743, PubMed:26936974). May play a role in tumorigenesis by activating procarcinogens such as aflatoxin B1, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dihydrodiols and aromatic amines (PubMed:16551781, PubMed:20805301, PubMed:24278521). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR; NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:22591743, PubMed:26936974).
