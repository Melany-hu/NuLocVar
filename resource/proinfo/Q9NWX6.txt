UniprotID	Q9NWX6
Accession	Q9NWX6;D3DQJ5;Q53G12;Q7L5R3;Q9H0S2
EntryName	THG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable tRNA(His) guanylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.79) (Induced in high glucose-1) (IHG-1) (Interphase cytoplasmic foci protein 45) (tRNA-histidine guanylyltransferase)
GeneName	THG1L ICF45
Length	298
Function	Adds a GMP to the 5'-end of tRNA(His) after transcription and RNase P cleavage. This step is essential for proper recognition of the tRNA and for the fidelity of protein synthesis (Probable). Also functions as a guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor/GEF for the MFN1 and MFN2 mitofusins thereby regulating mitochondrial fusion (PubMed:25008184, PubMed:27307223). By regulating both mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetic function, it contributes to cell survival following oxidative stress (PubMed:25008184, PubMed:27307223).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Mitochondrion outer membrane
