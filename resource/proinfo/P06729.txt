UniprotID	P06729
Accession	P06729;Q96TE5
EntryName	CD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	T-cell surface antigen CD2 (Erythrocyte receptor) (LFA-2) (LFA-3 receptor) (Rosette receptor) (T-cell surface antigen T11/Leu-5) (CD antigen CD2)
GeneName	CD2 SRBC
Length	351
Function	CD2 interacts with lymphocyte function-associated antigen CD58 (LFA-3) and CD48/BCM1 to mediate adhesion between T-cells and other cell types. CD2 is implicated in the triggering of T-cells, the cytoplasmic domain is implicated in the signaling function.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
