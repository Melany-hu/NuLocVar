UniprotID	Q9BWV7
Accession	Q9BWV7;B2RB11;B3KS77;Q7Z6R8;Q86X22
EntryName	TTLL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable tubulin polyglutamylase TTLL2 (EC 6.-.-.-) (Testis-specific protein NYD-TSPG) (Tubulin--tyrosine ligase-like protein 2)
GeneName	TTLL2 C6orf104
Length	592
Function	Probable tubulin polyglutamylase that generates side chains of glutamate on the gamma-carboxyl group of specific glutamate residues within the C-terminal tail of target proteins (By similarity). Similar to TTLL1, may acquire enzymatic activity only in complex with other proteins as it is most likely lacking domains important for autonomous activity (By similarity). Probably involved in the side-chain initiation step of the polyglutamylation reaction rather than the elongation step (By similarity).
