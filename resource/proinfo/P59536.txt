UniprotID	P59536
Accession	P59536;P59550;Q495I2;Q50KJ5;Q50KJ6;Q50KJ7;Q645W7
EntryName	T2R41_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 41 (T2R41) (Taste receptor type 2 member 59) (T2R59)
GeneName	TAS2R41
Length	307
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5 (By similarity).
