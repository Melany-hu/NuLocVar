UniprotID	Q6SPF0
Accession	Q6SPF0;Q6P0R3;Q6PIS7;Q96IM4
EntryName	SAMD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 1 (SAM domain-containing protein 1) (Atherin)
GeneName	SAMD1
Length	538
Function	Unmethylated CpG islands (CGIs)-binding protein which localizes to H3K4me3-decorated CGIs, where it acts as a transcriptional repressor (PubMed:33980486). Tethers L3MBTL3 to chromatin and interacts with the KDM1A histone demethylase complex to modulate H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels at CGIs (PubMed:33980486). Plays a role in atherogenesis by binding with LDL on cell surface and promoting LDL oxidation which leads to the formation of foam cell (PubMed:16159594, PubMed:34006929).
