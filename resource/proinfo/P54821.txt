UniprotID	P54821
Accession	P54821;B5BUM7;O60807
EntryName	PRRX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Paired mesoderm homeobox protein 1 (Homeobox protein PHOX1) (Paired-related homeobox protein 1) (PRX-1)
GeneName	PRRX1 PMX1
Length	245
Function	Master transcription factor of stromal fibroblasts for myofibroblastic lineage progression. Orchestrates the functional drift of fibroblasts into myofibroblastic phenotype via TGF-beta signaling by remodeling a super-enhancer landscape. Through this function, plays an essential role in wound healing process (PubMed:35589735). Acts as a transcriptional regulator of muscle creatine kinase (MCK) and so has a role in the establishment of diverse mesodermal muscle types. The protein binds to an A/T-rich element in the muscle creatine enhancer (By similarity). May play a role in homeostasis and regeneration of bone, white adipose tissue and derm (By similarity).
