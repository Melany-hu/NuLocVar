UniprotID	Q14642
Accession	Q14642;D3DXI3;Q14640;Q5JSF1
EntryName	I5P1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase A (EC 3.1.3.56) (43 kDa inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase) (Type I inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase) (5PTase)
GeneName	INPP5A 5PTASE
Length	412
Function	Phosphatase that specifically hydrolyzes the 5-phosphate of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to inositol 1,4-bisphosphate, and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrasphosphate to inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (PubMed:8013665, PubMed:8626616, PubMed:8769125). Plays a crucial role in the survival of cerebellar Purkinje cells (By similarity).
