UniprotID	P11169
Accession	P11169;B2R606;D3DUU6;Q6I9U2;Q9UG15
EntryName	GTR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 3 (Glucose transporter type 3, brain) (GLUT-3)
GeneName	SLC2A3 GLUT3
Length	496
Function	Facilitative glucose transporter (PubMed:26176916, PubMed:32860739, PubMed:9477959). Can also mediate the uptake of various other monosaccharides across the cell membrane (PubMed:26176916, PubMed:9477959). Mediates the uptake of glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, galactose, mannose, xylose and fucose, and probably also dehydroascorbate (PubMed:26176916, PubMed:9477959). Does not mediate fructose transport (PubMed:26176916, PubMed:9477959). Required for mesendoderm differentiation (By similarity).
