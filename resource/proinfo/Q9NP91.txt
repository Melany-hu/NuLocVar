UniprotID	Q9NP91
Accession	Q9NP91;A1A4F2;O75590;Q8TF10;Q9NPQ2;Q9NQ77
EntryName	S6A20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium- and chloride-dependent transporter XTRP3 (Sodium/imino-acid transporter 1) (Solute carrier family 6 member 20) (Transporter rB21A homolog)
GeneName	SLC6A20 SIT1 XT3 XTRP3
Length	592
Function	Mediates the Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent uptake of imino acids such as L-proline, N-methyl-L-proline and pipecolate as well as N-methylated amino acids (PubMed:15632147, PubMed:19033659, PubMed:33428810). Also transports glycine, regulates proline and glycine homeostasis in the brain playing a role in the modulation of NMDAR currents (PubMed:33428810).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane
