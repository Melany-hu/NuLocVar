EntryName	COL11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Collectin-11 (Collectin kidney protein 1) (CL-K1)
GeneName	COLEC11 UNQ596/PRO1182
Length	223
Function	Lectin that plays a role in innate immunity, apoptosis and embryogenesis (PubMed:21258343, PubMed:23954398, PubMed:25912189). Calcium-dependent lectin that binds self and non-self glycoproteins presenting high mannose oligosaccharides with at least one terminal alpha-1,2-linked mannose epitope (PubMed:25912189). Primarily recognizes the terminal disaccharide of the glycan (PubMed:25912189). Also recognizes a subset of fucosylated glycans and lipopolysaccharides (PubMed:17179669, PubMed:25912189). Plays a role in innate immunity through its ability to bind non-self sugars presented by microorganisms and to activate the complement through the recruitment of MAPS1 (PubMed:20956340, PubMed:25912189). Also plays a role in apoptosis through its ability to bind in a calcium-independent manner the DNA present at the surface of apoptotic cells and to activate the complement in response to this binding (Probable). Finally, plays a role in development, probably serving as a guidance cue during the migration of neural crest cells and other cell types during embryogenesis (PubMed:21258343, PubMed:28301481).
