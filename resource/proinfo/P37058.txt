UniprotID	P37058
Accession	P37058;Q5U0Q6
EntryName	DHB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (17-beta-HSD 3) (Estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase 2) (EC 1.1.1.62) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 12C member 2) (Testicular 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) (Testosterone 17-beta-dehydrogenase 3) (EC 1.1.1.64)
GeneName	HSD17B3 EDH17B3 SDR12C2
Length	310
Function	Catalyzes the conversion of 17-oxosteroids to 17beta-hydroxysteroids (PubMed:16216911, PubMed:26545797, PubMed:27927697, PubMed:8075637). Favors the reduction of androstenedione to testosterone (PubMed:16216911, PubMed:26545797, PubMed:27927697). Testosterone is the key androgen driving male development and function (PubMed:8075637). Uses NADPH while the two other EDH17B enzymes use NADH (PubMed:16216911, PubMed:26545797, PubMed:8075637). Androgens such as epiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, androsterone and androstanedione are accepted as substrates and reduced at C-17 (PubMed:16216911). Can reduce 11-ketoandrostenedione as well as 11beta-hydroxyandrostenedione at C-17 to the respective testosterone forms (PubMed:16216911, PubMed:27927697).
