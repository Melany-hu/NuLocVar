UniprotID	P18031
Accession	P18031;Q5TGD8;Q9BQV9;Q9NQQ4
EntryName	PTN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (EC 3.1.3.48) (Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B) (PTP-1B)
GeneName	PTPN1 PTP1B
Length	435
Function	Tyrosine-protein phosphatase which acts as a regulator of endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response. Mediates dephosphorylation of EIF2AK3/PERK; inactivating the protein kinase activity of EIF2AK3/PERK. May play an important role in CKII- and p60c-src-induced signal transduction cascades. May regulate the EFNA5-EPHA3 signaling pathway which modulates cell reorganization and cell-cell repulsion. May also regulate the hepatocyte growth factor receptor signaling pathway through dephosphorylation of MET.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
