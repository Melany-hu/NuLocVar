UniprotID	Q3MUY2
Accession	Q3MUY2
EntryName	PIGY_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit Y (Phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class Y protein) (PIG-Y)
GeneName	PIGY
Length	71
Function	Part of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex that catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol and participates in the first step of GPI biosynthesis (PubMed:16162815). May act by regulating the catalytic subunit PIGA (PubMed:16162815).
