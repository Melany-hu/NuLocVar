Accession	Q8NCE0;B7Z6K1;C9IZI7;G5E9Q3;Q8WTW7;Q9BPU7
EntryName	SEN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA-splicing endonuclease subunit Sen2 (EC 4.6.1.16) (tRNA-intron endonuclease Sen2) (HsSen2)
GeneName	TSEN2 SEN2
Length	406
Function	Constitutes one of the two catalytic subunit of the tRNA-splicing endonuclease complex, a complex responsible for identification and cleavage of the splice sites in pre-tRNA. It cleaves pre-tRNA at the 5'- and 3'-splice sites to release the intron. The products are an intron and two tRNA half-molecules bearing 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-OH termini. There are no conserved sequences at the splice sites, but the intron is invariably located at the same site in the gene, placing the splice sites an invariant distance from the constant structural features of the tRNA body. Isoform 1 probably carries the active site for 5'-splice site cleavage. The tRNA splicing endonuclease is also involved in mRNA processing via its association with pre-mRNA 3'-end processing factors, establishing a link between pre-tRNA splicing and pre-mRNA 3'-end formation, suggesting that the endonuclease subunits function in multiple RNA-processing events. Isoform 2 is responsible for processing a yet unknown RNA substrate. The complex containing isoform 2 is not able to cleave pre-tRNAs properly, although it retains endonucleolytic activity.
