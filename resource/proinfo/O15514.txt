UniprotID	O15514
Accession	O15514;Q52LT4
EntryName	RPB4_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB4 (RNA polymerase II subunit B4) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit D) (RNA polymerase II 16 kDa subunit) (RPB16)
GeneName	POLR2D
Length	142
Function	Core component of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. POLR2D/RPB4 is part of a subcomplex with POLR2G/RPB7 that binds to a pocket formed by POLR2A/RPB1, POLR2B/RPB2 and POLR2F/RPABC2 at the base of the clamp element. The POLR2D/RPB4-POLR2G/RPB7 subcomplex seems to lock the clamp via POLR2G/RPB7 in the closed conformation thus preventing double-stranded DNA to enter the active site cleft. The POLR2D/RPB4-POLR2G/RPB7 subcomplex binds single-stranded DNA and RNA.
