UniprotID	Q9BVM4
Accession	Q9BVM4;B3KTN1;Q9BT41
EntryName	GGACT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-glutamylaminecyclotransferase (GGACT) (EC 4.3.2.8) (AIG2-like domain-containing protein 1) (Gamma-glutamylamine cyclotransferase)
GeneName	GGACT A2LD1
Length	153
Function	Contributes to degradation of proteins cross-linked by transglutaminases by degrading the cross-link between a lysine and a glutamic acid residue. Catalyzes the formation of 5-oxo-L-proline from L-gamma-glutamyl-L-epsilon-lysine. Inactive with L-gamma-glutamyl-alpha-amino acid substrates such as L-gamma-glutamyl-L-alpha-cysteine and L-gamma-glutamyl-L-alpha-alanine.
