UniprotID	Q8N6W0
Accession	Q8N6W0;D6W614;O75253;Q59GP2;Q86VW6;Q9BZC0;Q9NR86
EntryName	CELF5_HUMAN
ProteinName	CUGBP Elav-like family member 5 (CELF-5) (Bruno-like protein 5) (CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factor 5) (RNA-binding protein BRUNOL-5)
GeneName	CELF5 BRUNOL5
Length	485
Function	RNA-binding protein implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. Mediates exon inclusion and/or exclusion in pre-mRNA that are subject to tissue-specific and developmentally regulated alternative splicing. Specifically activates exon 5 inclusion of cardiac isoforms of TNNT2 during heart remodeling at the juvenile to adult transition. Binds to muscle-specific splicing enhancer (MSE) intronic sites flanking the alternative exon 5 of TNNT2 pre-mRNA.
