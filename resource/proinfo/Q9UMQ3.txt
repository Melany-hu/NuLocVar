UniprotID	Q9UMQ3
Accession	Q9UMQ3;O43518;Q6NT51
EntryName	BARX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein BarH-like 2
GeneName	BARX2
Length	279
Function	Transcription factor. Binds optimally to the DNA consensus sequence 5'-YYTAATGRTTTTY-3'. May control the expression of neural adhesion molecules such as L1 or Ng-CAM during embryonic development of both the central and peripherical nervous system. May be involved in controlling adhesive processes in keratinizing epithelia (By similarity).
