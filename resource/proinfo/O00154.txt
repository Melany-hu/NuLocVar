EntryName	BACH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytosolic acyl coenzyme A thioester hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.2) (Acyl-CoA thioesterase 7) (Brain acyl-CoA hydrolase) (BACH) (hBACH) (CTE-IIa) (CTE-II) (Long chain acyl-CoA thioester hydrolase)
GeneName	ACOT7 BACH
Length	380
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoASH), regulating their respective intracellular levels (PubMed:10578051). Preferentially hydrolyzes palmitoyl-CoA, but has a broad specificity acting on other fatty acyl-CoAs with chain-lengths of C8-C18 (PubMed:10578051). May play an important physiological function in brain (PubMed:10578051).
