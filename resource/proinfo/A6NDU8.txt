UniprotID	A6NDU8
Accession	A6NDU8;A2RRM9
EntryName	RIMC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RAB7A-interacting MON1-CCZ1 complex subunit 1 (UPF0600 protein C5orf51)
GeneName	RIMOC1 C5orf51
Length	294
Function	Plays an important role in the removal of damaged mitochondria via mitophagy by controlling the stability and localization of RAB7A. Required for the recruitment of RAB7A and ATG9A vesicles to damaged mitochondria and promotes the stability of RAB7A by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation during mitophagy.
