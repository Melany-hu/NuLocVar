EntryName	MFSD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysosomal dipeptide transporter MFSD1 (Major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 1) (Smooth muscle cell-associated protein 4) (SMAP-4)
GeneName	MFSD1 SMAP4 UG0581B09
Length	465
Function	Lysosomal dipeptide uniporter that selectively exports lysine, arginine or histidine-containing dipeptides with a net positive charge from the lysosome lumen into the cytosol (PubMed:38507452). Could play a role in a specific type of protein O-glycosylation indirectly regulating macrophages migration and tissue invasion (PubMed:30910009). Also essential for liver homeostasis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane
