Accession	Q9NZU7;O95663;Q8N6H5;Q9NZU8
EntryName	CABP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium-binding protein 1 (CaBP1) (Calbrain) (Caldendrin)
GeneName	CABP1
Length	370
Function	Modulates calcium-dependent activity of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (ITPRs) (PubMed:14570872). Inhibits agonist-induced intracellular calcium signaling (PubMed:15980432). Enhances inactivation and does not support calcium-dependent facilitation of voltage-dependent P/Q-type calcium channels (PubMed:11865310). Causes calcium-dependent facilitation and inhibits inactivation of L-type calcium channels by binding to the same sites as calmodulin in the C-terminal domain of CACNA1C, but has an opposite effect on channel function (PubMed:15140941). Suppresses the calcium-dependent inactivation of CACNA1D (By similarity). Inhibits TRPC5 channels (PubMed:15895247). Prevents NMDA receptor-induced cellular degeneration. Required for the normal transfer of light signals through the retina (By similarity).
