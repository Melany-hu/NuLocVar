UniprotID	Q701N4
Accession	Q701N4;A9JTZ1
EntryName	KRA52_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 5-2 (Keratin-associated protein 5-8) (Keratin-associated protein 5.2) (Keratin-associated protein 5.8) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 5.2)
GeneName	KRTAP5-2 KAP5-8 KAP5.2 KRTAP5-8 KRTAP5.2 KRTAP5.8
Length	177
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated protein (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
