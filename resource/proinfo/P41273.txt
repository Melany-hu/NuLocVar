UniprotID	P41273
Accession	P41273;Q2M3S2
EntryName	TNFL9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 9 (4-1BB ligand) (4-1BBL)
GeneName	TNFSF9
Length	254
Function	Cytokine that binds to TNFRSF9. Induces the proliferation of activated peripheral blood T-cells. May have a role in activation-induced cell death (AICD). May play a role in cognate interactions between T-cells and B-cells/macrophages.
