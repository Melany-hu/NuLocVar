EntryName	OTUB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin thioesterase OTUB1 (EC 3.4.19.12) (Deubiquitinating enzyme OTUB1) (OTU domain-containing ubiquitin aldehyde-binding protein 1) (Otubain-1) (hOTU1) (Ubiquitin-specific-processing protease OTUB1)
GeneName	OTUB1 OTB1 OTU1 HSPC263
Length	271
Function	Hydrolase that can specifically remove 'Lys-48'-linked conjugated ubiquitin from proteins and plays an important regulatory role at the level of protein turnover by preventing degradation (PubMed:12401499, PubMed:12704427, PubMed:14661020, PubMed:23827681). Regulator of T-cell anergy, a phenomenon that occurs when T-cells are rendered unresponsive to antigen rechallenge and no longer respond to their cognate antigen (PubMed:14661020). Acts via its interaction with RNF128/GRAIL, a crucial inductor of CD4 T-cell anergy (PubMed:14661020). Isoform 1 destabilizes RNF128, leading to prevent anergy (PubMed:14661020). In contrast, isoform 2 stabilizes RNF128 and promotes anergy (PubMed:14661020). Surprisingly, it regulates RNF128-mediated ubiquitination, but does not deubiquitinate polyubiquitinated RNF128 (PubMed:14661020). Deubiquitinates estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) (PubMed:19383985). Mediates deubiquitination of 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains, but not 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:18954305, PubMed:19211026, PubMed:23827681). Not able to cleave di-ubiquitin (PubMed:18954305, PubMed:23827681). Also capable of removing NEDD8 from NEDD8 conjugates, but with a much lower preference compared to 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitin (PubMed:18954305, PubMed:23827681).
