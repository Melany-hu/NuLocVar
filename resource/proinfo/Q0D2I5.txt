UniprotID	Q0D2I5
Accession	Q0D2I5;Q24JT6;Q7L5J9;Q7Z5X4;Q9BQ46
EntryName	IFFO1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Non-homologous end joining factor IFFO1 (NHEJ factor IFFO1) (Intermediate filament family orphan 1) (Tumor antigen HOM-TES-103)
GeneName	IFFO1 IFFO
Length	559
Function	Nuclear matrix protein involved in the immobilization of broken DNA ends and the suppression of chromosome translocation during DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:31548606). Interacts with the nuclear lamina component LMNA, resulting in the formation of a nucleoskeleton that relocalizes to the DSB sites in a XRCC4-dependent manner and promotes the immobilization of the broken ends, thereby preventing chromosome translocation (PubMed:31548606). Acts as a scaffold that allows the DNA repair protein XRCC4 and LMNA to assemble into a complex at the DSB sites (PubMed:31548606).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleus; Nucleoplasm; Nucleus inner membrane; Nucleus matrix
