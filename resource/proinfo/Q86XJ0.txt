UniprotID	Q86XJ0
Accession	Q86XJ0;Q5W090;Q8IXR2
EntryName	CAHM3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium homeostasis modulator protein 3 (Protein A)
GeneName	CALHM3 FAM26A
Length	344
Function	Pore-forming subunit of gustatory voltage-gated ion channels required for sensory perception of sweet, bitter and umami tastes. With CALHM1 forms a fast-activating voltage-gated ATP-release channel in type II taste bud cells, ATP acting as a neurotransmitter to activate afferent neural gustatory pathways. Acts both as a voltage-gated and calcium-activated ion channel: mediates neuronal excitability in response to membrane depolarization and low extracellular Ca(2+) concentration. Has poor ion selectivity and forms a wide pore (around 14 Angstroms) that mediates permeation of small ions including Ca(2+), Na(+), K(+) and Cl(-), as well as larger ions such as ATP(4-).
Subcellular Location	Basolateral cell membrane
