UniprotID	Q3LI73
Accession	Q3LI73;Q17RT4;Q17RT6
EntryName	KR194_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 19-4
GeneName	KRTAP19-4 KAP19.4
Length	84
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
