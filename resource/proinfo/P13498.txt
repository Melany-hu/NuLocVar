UniprotID	P13498
Accession	P13498;Q14090;Q9BR72
EntryName	CY24A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome b-245 light chain (Cytochrome b(558) alpha chain) (Cytochrome b558 subunit alpha) (Neutrophil cytochrome b 22 kDa polypeptide) (Superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase light chain subunit) (p22 phagocyte B-cytochrome) (p22-phox) (p22phox)
GeneName	CYBA
Length	195
Function	Subunit of NADPH oxidase complexes that is required for the NADPH oxidase activity that generates, in various cell types, superoxide from molecular oxygen utilizing NADPH as an electron donor (PubMed:15824103, PubMed:17140397, PubMed:38355798). Subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex that mediates the transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADPH to O2 to produce the superoxide anion (O2(-)) (PubMed:38355798). In the activated complex, electrons are first transferred from NADPH to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and subsequently transferred via two heme molecules to molecular oxygen, producing superoxide through an outer-sphere reaction (PubMed:38355798). Activation of the NADPH oxidase complex is initiated by the assembly of cytosolic subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex with the core NADPH oxidase complex to form a complex at the plasma membrane or phagosomal membrane (PubMed:38355798). This activation process is initiated by phosphorylation dependent binding of the cytosolic NCF1/p47-phox subunit to the C-terminus of CYBA/p22-phox (PubMed:19948736). Aassociates with NOX3 to form a functional NADPH oxidase constitutively generating superoxide (PubMed:15824103, PubMed:17140397).
