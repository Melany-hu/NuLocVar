EntryName	ZACN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ligand-gated cation channel ZACN (Ligand-gated ion channel zinc-activated 1) (Ligand-gated ion-channel receptor L2) (Zinc-activated channel)
GeneName	ZACN L2 LGICZ LGICZ1 ZAC
Length	412
Function	Ligand-gated cation channel that allows the movement of sodium and potassium monoatomic cations across cell membranes when activated by zinc (Zn2+), copper (Cu2+), and changes in pH (PubMed:26872532). Could also transport cesium (PubMed:26872532).
