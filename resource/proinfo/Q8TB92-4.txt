UniprotID	Q8TB92-4
Accession	Q8TB92;B1AQ42;B3KNV0;B7Z1S7;F8W793;Q6ZSA9
EntryName	HMGC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, cytoplasmic (EC 4.1.3.4) (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase-like protein 1) (HMGCL-like 1) (Endoplasmic reticulum 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase) (er-cHL)
GeneName	HMGCLL1
Length	53
Function	Non-mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase that catalyzes a cation-dependent cleavage of (S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA into acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate, a key step in ketogenesis, the products of which support energy production in nonhepatic animal tissues.
