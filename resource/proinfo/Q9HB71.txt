UniprotID	Q9HB71
Accession	Q9HB71;B2ZWH2;B3KSF1;O60666;Q5R370;Q5R371
EntryName	CYBP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcyclin-binding protein (CacyBP) (hCacyBP) (S100A6-binding protein) (Siah-interacting protein)
GeneName	CACYBP S100A6BP SIP PNAS-107
Length	228
Function	May be involved in calcium-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Probably serves as a molecular bridge in ubiquitin E3 complexes. Participates in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin (CTNNB1).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm
