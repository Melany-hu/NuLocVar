UniprotID	Q9Y3C5
Accession	Q9Y3C5;A8KAI2;Q5T7R8
EntryName	RNF11_HUMAN
ProteinName	RING finger protein 11
GeneName	RNF11 CGI-123
Length	154
Function	Essential component of a ubiquitin-editing protein complex, comprising also TNFAIP3, ITCH and TAX1BP1, that ensures the transient nature of inflammatory signaling pathways. Promotes the association of TNFAIP3 to RIPK1 after TNF stimulation. TNFAIP3 deubiquitinates 'Lys-63' polyubiquitin chains on RIPK1 and catalyzes the formation of 'Lys-48'-polyubiquitin chains. This leads to RIPK1 proteasomal degradation and consequently termination of the TNF- or LPS-mediated activation of NF-kappa-B. Recruits STAMBP to the E3 ubiquitin-ligase SMURF2 for ubiquitination, leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome.
