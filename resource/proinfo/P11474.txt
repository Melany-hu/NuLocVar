UniprotID	P11474
Accession	P11474;Q14514
EntryName	ERR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Steroid hormone receptor ERR1 (Estrogen receptor-like 1) (Estrogen-related receptor alpha) (ERR-alpha) (Nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group B member 1)
GeneName	ESRRA ERR1 ESRL1 NR3B1
Length	423
Function	Binds to an ERR-alpha response element (ERRE) containing a single consensus half-site, 5'-TNAAGGTCA-3'. Can bind to the medium-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) response element NRRE-1 and may act as an important regulator of MCAD promoter. Binds to the C1 region of the lactoferrin gene promoter. Requires dimerization and the coactivator, PGC-1A, for full activity. The ERRalpha/PGC1alpha complex is a regulator of energy metabolism. Induces the expression of PERM1 in the skeletal muscle.
