UniprotID	P41586
Accession	P41586;A8K1Y1;B7ZLA7;B8ZZK3;Q17S10
EntryName	PACR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor (PAC1 receptor) (PAC1R) (PACAP type I receptor) (PACAP-R-1) (PACAP-R1)
GeneName	ADCYAP1R1
Length	468
Function	G protein-coupled receptor activated by the neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ADCYAP1/PACAP) (PubMed:32047270, PubMed:33715378, PubMed:35477937, PubMed:36385145). Binds both PACAP27 and PACAP38 bioactive peptides (PubMed:32047270, PubMed:35477937, PubMed:36385145). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors. Activates cAMP-dependent pathway (PubMed:32047270, PubMed:33715378, PubMed:35477937, PubMed:36385145). May regulate the release of adrenocorticotropin, luteinizing hormone, growth hormone, prolactin, epinephrine, and catecholamine. May play a role in spermatogenesis and sperm motility. Causes smooth muscle relaxation and secretion in the gastrointestinal tract (PubMed:32047270, PubMed:33715378).
