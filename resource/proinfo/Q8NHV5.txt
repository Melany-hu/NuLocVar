UniprotID	Q8NHV5
Accession	Q8NHV5;H3BNM6
EntryName	MOSMO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Modulator of smoothened protein (Attenuator of hedgehog)
GeneName	MOSMO ATTHOG C16orf52
Length	167
Function	Acts as a negative regulator of hedgehog signaling probably by promoting internalization and subsequent degradation of smoothened protein (SMO) present in the ciliary membrane. Plays a role in sonic hedgehog (SHH)-induced spinal neural progenitor cells differentiation.
Subcellular Location	Cell projection; Cilium membrane; Cell membrane
