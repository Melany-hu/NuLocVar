UniprotID	Q9UJW9
Accession	Q9UJW9;B3KQB3;Q96CQ2
EntryName	SRTD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	SERTA domain-containing protein 3 (Replication protein-binding trans-activator) (RPA-binding trans-activator)
GeneName	SERTAD3 RBT1
Length	196
Function	Antiviral interferon-stimulated protein that plays a role in innate immunity and in the suppression of viruses through different mechanisms (PubMed:33147462, PubMed:36594413). Plays a role in the late phase response of TLR-induced immune effector expression (By similarity). During influenza infection, interacts with PB2, PB1, and PA to disrupt the formation of the viral RdRp complex (PubMed:33147462). Inhibits zika virus by interacting with the capsid protein in the nucleolus and reducing its abundance through proteasomal degradation (PubMed:36594413). Strong transcriptional coactivator (PubMed:10982866).
