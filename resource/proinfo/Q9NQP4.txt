UniprotID	Q9NQP4
Accession	Q9NQP4;Q5TD11;Q92779
EntryName	PFD4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prefoldin subunit 4 (Protein C-1)
GeneName	PFDN4 PFD4
Length	134
Function	Binds specifically to cytosolic chaperonin (c-CPN) and transfers target proteins to it. Binds to nascent polypeptide chain and promotes folding in an environment in which there are many competing pathways for nonnative proteins.
