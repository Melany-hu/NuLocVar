UniprotID	Q15545
Accession	Q15545;B2RBV9;Q13036
EntryName	TAF7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 7 (RNA polymerase II TBP-associated factor subunit F) (Transcription initiation factor TFIID 55 kDa subunit) (TAF(II)55) (TAFII-55) (TAFII55)
GeneName	TAF7 TAF2F TAFII55
Length	349
Function	The TFIID basal transcription factor complex plays a major role in the initiation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription (PubMed:33795473). TFIID recognizes and binds promoters with or without a TATA box via its subunit TBP, a TATA-box-binding protein, and promotes assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (PubMed:33795473). The TFIID complex consists of TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), including TAF1, TAF2, TAF3, TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF7, TAF8, TAF9, TAF10, TAF11, TAF12 and TAF13 (PubMed:10438527, PubMed:33795473). TAF7 forms a promoter DNA binding subcomplex of TFIID, together with TAF1 and TAF2 (PubMed:33795473). Part of a TFIID complex containing TAF10 (TFIID alpha) and a TFIID complex lacking TAF10 (TFIID beta) (PubMed:10438527).
