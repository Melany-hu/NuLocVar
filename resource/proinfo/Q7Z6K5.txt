UniprotID	Q7Z6K5
Accession	Q7Z6K5;E2QRD5
EntryName	ARPIN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Arpin (Arp2/3 inhibition protein)
GeneName	ARPIN C15orf38
Length	226
Function	Regulates actin polymerization by inhibiting the actin-nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex; the function is competitive with nucleation promoting factors. Participates in an incoherent feedforward loop at the lamellipodium tip where it inhibits the ARP2/2 complex in response to Rac signaling and where Rac also stimulates actin polymerization through the WAVE complex. Involved in steering cell migration by controlling its directional persistence.
Subcellular Location	Cell projection; Lamellipodium
