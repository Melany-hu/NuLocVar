UniprotID	Q9H1N7
Accession	Q9H1N7;A6NKX9;Q1XH11;Q6MZJ0;Q7Z662;Q9Y308
EntryName	S35B3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenosine 3'-phospho 5'-phosphosulfate transporter 2 (3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate transporter) (PAPS transporter 2) (Solute carrier family 35 member B3)
GeneName	SLC35B3 C6orf196 PAPST2 CGI-19
Length	401
Function	Probably functions as a 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate:adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate antiporter at the Golgi membranes. Mediates the transport from the cytosol into the lumen of the Golgi of 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate/adenosine 3'-phospho 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), a universal sulfuryl donor for sulfation events that take place in that compartment.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
