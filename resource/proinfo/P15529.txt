EntryName	MCP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Membrane cofactor protein (TLX) (Trophoblast leukocyte common antigen) (CD antigen CD46)
GeneName	CD46 MCP MIC10
Length	392
Function	Acts as a cofactor for complement factor I, a serine protease which protects autologous cells against complement-mediated injury by cleaving C3b and C4b deposited on host tissue. May be involved in the fusion of the spermatozoa with the oocyte during fertilization. Also acts as a costimulatory factor for T-cells which induces the differentiation of CD4+ into T-regulatory 1 cells. T-regulatory 1 cells suppress immune responses by secreting interleukin-10, and therefore are thought to prevent autoimmunity.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Acrosome inner membrane
