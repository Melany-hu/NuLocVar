UniprotID	P01225
Accession	P01225;A2TF08;A5JVV3;Q14D61
EntryName	FSHB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Follitropin subunit beta (Follicle-stimulating hormone beta subunit) (FSH-B) (FSH-beta) (Follitropin beta chain)
GeneName	FSHB
Length	129
Function	Together with the alpha chain CGA constitutes follitropin, the follicle-stimulating hormone, and provides its biological specificity to the hormone heterodimer. Binds FSHR, a G protein-coupled receptor, on target cells to activate downstream signaling pathways (PubMed:24692546, PubMed:2494176). Follitropin is involved in follicle development and spermatogenesis in reproductive organs (PubMed:407105, PubMed:8220432).
