EntryName	MYG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	MYG1 exonuclease (EC 3.1.-.-)
GeneName	MYG1 C12orf10
Length	376
Function	3'-5' RNA exonuclease which cleaves in situ on specific transcripts in both nucleus and mitochondrion. Involved in regulating spatially segregated organellar RNA processing, acts as a coordinator of nucleo-mitochondrial crosstalk (PubMed:31081026). In nucleolus, processes pre-ribosomal RNA involved in ribosome assembly and alters cytoplasmic translation. In mitochondrial matrix, processes 3'-termini of the mito-ribosomal and messenger RNAs and controls translation of mitochondrial proteins (Probable).
