UniprotID	Q07817
Accession	Q07817;E1P5L6;Q5CZ89;Q5TE65;Q92976
EntryName	B2CL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bcl-2-like protein 1 (Bcl2-L-1) (Apoptosis regulator Bcl-X)
GeneName	BCL2L1 BCL2L BCLX
Length	233
Function	Potent inhibitor of cell death. Inhibits activation of caspases. Appears to regulate cell death by blocking the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) by binding to it and preventing the release of the caspase activator, CYC1, from the mitochondrial membrane. Also acts as a regulator of G2 checkpoint and progression to cytokinesis during mitosis.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Mitochondrion outer membrane; Mitochondrion matrix; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome; Nucleus membrane
