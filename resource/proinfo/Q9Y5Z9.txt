UniprotID	Q9Y5Z9
Accession	Q9Y5Z9;B3KQG3;Q53GX3;Q5THD4
EntryName	UBIA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein 1 (EC 2.5.1.-) (EC 2.5.1.39) (Transitional epithelial response protein 1)
GeneName	UBIAD1 TERE1
Length	338
Function	Prenyltransferase that mediates the formation of menaquinone-4 (MK-4) and coenzyme Q10 (PubMed:20953171, PubMed:23374346). MK-4 is a vitamin K2 isoform present at high concentrations in the brain, kidney and pancreas, and is required for endothelial cell development (PubMed:20953171). Mediates the conversion of phylloquinone (PK) into MK-4, probably by cleaving the side chain of phylloquinone (PK) to release 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione; K3) and then prenylating it with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) to form MK-4 (PubMed:20953171). Also plays a role in cardiovascular development independently of MK-4 biosynthesis, by acting as a coenzyme Q10 biosynthetic enzyme: coenzyme Q10, also named ubiquinone, plays an important antioxidant role in the cardiovascular system (PubMed:23374346). Mediates biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 in the Golgi membrane, leading to protect cardiovascular tissues from NOS3/eNOS-dependent oxidative stress (PubMed:23374346).
