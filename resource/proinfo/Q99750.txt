UniprotID	Q99750
Accession	Q99750
EntryName	MDFI_HUMAN
ProteinName	MyoD family inhibitor (Myogenic repressor I-mf)
GeneName	MDFI
Length	246
Function	Inhibits the transactivation activity of the Myod family of myogenic factors and represses myogenesis. Acts by associating with Myod family members and retaining them in the cytoplasm by masking their nuclear localization signals. Can also interfere with the DNA-binding activity of Myod family members. Plays an important role in trophoblast and chondrogenic differentiation. Regulates the transcriptional activity of TCF7L1/TCF3 by interacting directly with TCF7L1/TCF3 and preventing it from binding DNA. Binds to the axin complex, resulting in an increase in the level of free beta-catenin. Affects axin regulation of the WNT and JNK signaling pathways (By similarity).
