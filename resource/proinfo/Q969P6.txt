EntryName	TOP1M_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA topoisomerase I, mitochondrial (TOP1mt) (EC 5.6.2.1)
GeneName	TOP1MT
Length	601
Function	Releases the supercoiling and torsional tension of DNA introduced during duplication of mitochondrial DNA by transiently cleaving and rejoining one strand of the DNA duplex. Introduces a single-strand break via transesterification at a target site in duplex DNA. The scissile phosphodiester is attacked by the catalytic tyrosine of the enzyme, resulting in the formation of a DNA-(3'-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate and the expulsion of a 5'-OH DNA strand. The free DNA strand then rotates around the intact phosphodiester bond on the opposing strand, thus removing DNA supercoils. Finally, in the religation step, the DNA 5'-OH attacks the covalent intermediate to expel the active-site tyrosine and restore the DNA phosphodiester backbone (By similarity).
