UniprotID	Q9UBB5
Accession	Q9UBB5;O95242;Q9UIS8
EntryName	MBD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (Demethylase) (DMTase) (Methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD2)
GeneName	MBD2
Length	411
Function	Binds CpG islands in promoters where the DNA is methylated at position 5 of cytosine within CpG dinucleotides (PubMed:9774669). Binds hemimethylated DNA as well (PubMed:10947852, PubMed:24307175). Recruits histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases to chromatin (PubMed:10471499, PubMed:10947852). Acts as a component of the histone deacetylase NuRD complex which participates in the remodeling of chromatin (PubMed:16428440, PubMed:28977666). Acts as a transcriptional repressor and plays a role in gene silencing (PubMed:10471499, PubMed:10947852, PubMed:16415179). Functions as a scaffold protein, targeting GATAD2A and GATAD2B to chromatin to promote repression (PubMed:16415179). May enhance the activation of some unmethylated cAMP-responsive promoters (PubMed:12665568).
