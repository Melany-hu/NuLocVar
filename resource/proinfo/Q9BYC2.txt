UniprotID	Q9BYC2
Accession	Q9BYC2;B2RBB4;Q5QPK4;Q8NHR1;Q9H1I4
EntryName	SCOT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase 2, mitochondrial (EC 2.8.3.5) (3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 2A) (Testis-specific succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase) (SCOT-t)
GeneName	OXCT2 FKSG25
Length	517
Function	Key enzyme for ketone body catabolism. Transfers the CoA moiety from succinate to acetoacetate. Formation of the enzyme-CoA intermediate proceeds via an unstable anhydride species formed between the carboxylate groups of the enzyme and substrate (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
