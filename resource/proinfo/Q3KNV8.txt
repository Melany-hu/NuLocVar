UniprotID	Q3KNV8
Accession	Q3KNV8;D3DVN1;O15262
EntryName	PCGF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polycomb group RING finger protein 3 (RING finger protein 3A)
GeneName	PCGF3 RNF3 RNF3A
Length	242
Function	Component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones; it mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119', rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility. Within the PRC1-like complex, regulates RNF2 ubiquitin ligase activity (PubMed:26151332). Plays a redundant role with PCGF5 as part of a PRC1-like complex that mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119' on the X chromosome and is required for normal silencing of one copy of the X chromosome in XX females (By similarity).
