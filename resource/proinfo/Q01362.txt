UniprotID	Q01362
Accession	Q01362;Q54A81
EntryName	FCERB_HUMAN
ProteinName	High affinity immunoglobulin epsilon receptor subunit beta (FcERI) (Fc epsilon receptor I beta-chain) (IgE Fc receptor subunit beta) (Membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A member 2)
GeneName	MS4A2 APY FCER1B IGER
Length	244
Function	High affinity receptor that binds to the Fc region of immunoglobulins epsilon. Aggregation of FCER1 by multivalent antigens is required for the full mast cell response, including the release of preformed mediators (such as histamine) by degranulation and de novo production of lipid mediators and cytokines. Also mediates the secretion of important lymphokines. Binding of allergen to receptor-bound IgE leads to cell activation and the release of mediators responsible for the manifestations of allergy.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
