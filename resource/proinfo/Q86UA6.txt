EntryName	RIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	RPA-interacting protein (hRIP)
GeneName	RPAIN RIP
Length	219
Function	Mediates the import of RPA complex into the nucleus, possibly via some interaction with importin beta. Isoform 2 is sumoylated and mediates the localization of RPA complex into the PML body of the nucleus, thereby participating in RPA function in DNA metabolism.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Nucleus; PML body
