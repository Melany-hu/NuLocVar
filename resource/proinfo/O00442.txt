EntryName	RTCA_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase (RNA cyclase) (RNA-3'-phosphate cyclase) (EC 6.5.1.4) (RNA terminal phosphate cyclase domain-containing protein 1) (RTC domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	RTCA RPC RPC1 RTC1 RTCD1
Length	366
Function	Catalyzes the conversion of 3'-phosphate to a 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester at the end of RNA (PubMed:9184239). The mechanism of action of the enzyme occurs in 3 steps: (A) adenylation of the enzyme by ATP; (B) transfer of adenylate to an RNA-N3'P to produce RNA-N3'PP5'A; (C) and attack of the adjacent 2'-hydroxyl on the 3'-phosphorus in the diester linkage to produce the cyclic end product (PubMed:9184239). Likely functions in some aspects of cellular RNA processing (PubMed:25961792, PubMed:9184239). Function plays an important role in regulating axon regeneration by inhibiting central nervous system (CNS) axon regeneration following optic nerve injury (PubMed:25961792).
