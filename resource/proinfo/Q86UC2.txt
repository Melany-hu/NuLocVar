UniprotID	Q86UC2
Accession	Q86UC2;Q96LQ5;Q96LX2;Q9BX75
EntryName	RSPH3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Radial spoke head protein 3 homolog (A-kinase anchor protein RSPH3) (Radial spoke head-like protein 2)
GeneName	RSPH3 RSHL2 RSP3
Length	560
Function	Functions as part of axonemal radial spoke complexes that play an important part in the motility of sperm and cilia (By similarity). Functions as a protein kinase A-anchoring protein that scaffolds the cAMP-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme. May serve as a point of convergence for MAPK and PKA signaling in cilia (PubMed:19684019).
