UniprotID	Q15329
Accession	Q15329;E9PBN9;Q16601;Q92756
EntryName	E2F5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor E2F5 (E2F-5)
GeneName	E2F5
Length	346
Function	Transcriptional activator that binds to E2F sites, these sites are present in the promoter of many genes whose products are involved in cell proliferation. May mediate growth factor-initiated signal transduction. It is likely involved in the early responses of resting cells to growth factor stimulation. Specifically required for multiciliate cell differentiation: together with MCIDAS and E2F5, binds and activate genes required for centriole biogenesis.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
