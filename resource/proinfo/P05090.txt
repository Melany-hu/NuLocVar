UniprotID	P05090
Accession	P05090;B2R579;D3DNW6;Q6IBG6
EntryName	APOD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Apolipoprotein D (Apo-D) (ApoD)
GeneName	APOD
Length	189
Function	APOD occurs in the macromolecular complex with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. It is probably involved in the transport and binding of bilin. Appears to be able to transport a variety of ligands in a number of different contexts.
