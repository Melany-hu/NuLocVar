UniprotID	P60412
Accession	P60412;A2RRF9
EntryName	KR10B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 10-11 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.11) (Keratin-associated protein 10.11) (Keratin-associated protein 18-11) (Keratin-associated protein 18.11)
GeneName	KRTAP10-11 KAP10.11 KAP18-11 KRTAP10.11 KRTAP18-11 KRTAP18.11
Length	298
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
