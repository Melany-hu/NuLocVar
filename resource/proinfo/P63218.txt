UniprotID	P63218
Accession	P63218;B2R5A0;P30670;Q5VX54;Q61015
EntryName	GBG5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(O) subunit gamma-5
GeneName	GNG5 GNGT5
Length	68
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
