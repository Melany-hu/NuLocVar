UniprotID	P23434
Accession	P23434;Q9H1E9
EntryName	GCSH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycine cleavage system H protein, mitochondrial (Lipoic acid-containing protein)
GeneName	GCSH
Length	173
Function	The glycine cleavage system catalyzes the degradation of glycine. The H protein (GCSH) shuttles the methylamine group of glycine from the P protein (GLDC) to the T protein (GCST). Has a pivotal role in the lipoylation of enzymes involved in cellular energetics such as the mitochondrial dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (DLAT), and the mitochondrial dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (DLST) (PubMed:36190515).
