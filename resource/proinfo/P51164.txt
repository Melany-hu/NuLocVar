UniprotID	P51164
Accession	P51164;B1B0N8
EntryName	ATP4B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta (Gastric H(+)/K(+) ATPase subunit beta) (Proton pump beta chain)
GeneName	ATP4B
Length	291
Function	The beta subunit of the gastric H(+)/K(+) ATPase pump which transports H(+) ions in exchange for K(+) ions across the apical membrane of parietal cells. Plays a structural and regulatory role in the assembly and membrane targeting of a functionally active pump (By similarity). Within a transport cycle, the transfer of a H(+) ion across the membrane is coupled to ATP hydrolysis and is associated with a transient phosphorylation of the alpha subunit that shifts the pump conformation from inward-facing (E1) to outward-facing state (E2). Interacts with the phosphorylation domain of the alpha subunit and functions as a ratchet, stabilizing the lumenal-open E2 conformation and preventing the reverse reaction of the transport cycle (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane; Cell membrane
