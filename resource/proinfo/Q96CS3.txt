Length	445
Function	Plays an important role in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) that mediates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins (PubMed:18711132, PubMed:24215460). By controlling the steady-state expression of the IGF1R receptor, indirectly regulates the insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway (PubMed:26692333). Involved in inhibition of lipid droplet degradation by binding to phospholipase PNPL2 and inhibiting its activity by promoting dissociation of PNPL2 from its endogenous activator, ABHD5 which inhibits the rate of triacylglycerol hydrolysis (PubMed:23297223). Involved in stress granule disassembly: associates with ubiquitinated G3BP1 in response to heat shock, thereby promoting interaction between ubiquitinated G3BP1 and VCP, followed by G3BP1 extraction from stress granules and stress granule disassembly (PubMed:34739333).
