EntryName	AGT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alanine--glyoxylate aminotransferase 2, mitochondrial (AGT 2) (EC 2.6.1.44) ((R)-3-amino-2-methylpropionate--pyruvate transaminase) (EC 2.6.1.40) (Beta-ALAAT II) (Beta-alanine-pyruvate aminotransferase) (EC 2.6.1.18) (D-3-aminoisobutyrate-pyruvate aminotransferase) (D-AIBAT) (D-beta-aminoisobutyrate-pyruvate aminotransferase)
GeneName	AGXT2 AGT2
Length	514
Function	Multifunctional aminotransferase with a broad substrate specificity (PubMed:20018850, PubMed:23023372, PubMed:24586340). Catalyzes the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine using alanine as the amino donor (By similarity). Catalyzes metabolism of not L- but the D-isomer of D-beta-aminoisobutyric acid to generate 2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate and alanine (PubMed:24586340). Catalyzes the transfer of the amino group from beta-alanine to pyruvate to yield L-alanine and 3-oxopropanoate (By similarity). Can metabolize NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), asymmetric NG,NG-dimethyl-L-arginine (ADMA) and symmetric NG,N'G-dimethyl-L-arginine (SDMA) (PubMed:20018850, PubMed:23023372). ADMA is a potent inhibitor of nitric-oxide (NO) synthase, and this activity provides mechanism through which the kidney regulates blood pressure (PubMed:20018850, PubMed:23023372).
