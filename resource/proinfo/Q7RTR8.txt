UniprotID	Q7RTR8
Accession	Q7RTR8;A2RRP4;Q645X0
EntryName	T2R42_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 42 (T2R42) (Taste receptor type 2 member 55) (T2R55)
GeneName	TAS2R42 TAS2R55
Length	314
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5 (By similarity).
