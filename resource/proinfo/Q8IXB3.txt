UniprotID	Q8IXB3
Accession	Q8IXB3;A6NMK4
EntryName	TARG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trafficking regulator of GLUT4 1 (Dispanin subfamily B member 1) (DSPB1) (Interferon-induced transmembrane domain-containing protein D3) (Protein located at seventeen-p-thirteen point three 1) (Tumor suppressor candidate 5)
GeneName	TRARG1 IFITMD3 LOST1 TUSC5
Length	177
Function	Regulates insulin-mediated adipose tissue glucose uptake and transport by modulation of SLC2A4 recycling. Not required for SLC2A4 membrane fusion upon an initial stimulus, but rather is necessary for proper protein recycling during prolonged insulin stimulation.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Endomembrane system; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region
