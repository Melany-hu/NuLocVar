UniprotID	Q14140
Accession	Q14140;Q53TS2
EntryName	SRTD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	SERTA domain-containing protein 2 (Transcriptional regulator interacting with the PHD-bromodomain 2) (TRIP-Br2)
GeneName	SERTAD2 KIAA0127 TRIPBR2
Length	314
Function	Acts at E2F-responsive promoters as coregulator to integrate signals provided by PHD- and/or bromodomain-containing transcription factors. May act as coactivator as well as corepressor of E2F1-TFDP1 and E2F4-TFDP1 complexes on E2F consensus binding sites, which would activate or inhibit E2F-target genes expression. Modulates fat storage by down-regulating the expression of key genes involved in adipocyte lipolysis, thermogenesis and oxidative metabolism.
