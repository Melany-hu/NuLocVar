EntryName	NAGK_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acetyl-D-glucosamine kinase (N-acetylglucosamine kinase) (EC 2.7.1.59) (GlcNAc kinase) (Muramyl dipeptide kinase) (EC 2.7.1.-) (N-acetyl-D-mannosamine kinase) (EC 2.7.1.60)
GeneName	NAGK
Length	344
Function	Converts endogenous N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a major component of complex carbohydrates, from lysosomal degradation or nutritional sources into GlcNAc 6-phosphate (PubMed:22692205). Involved in the N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) degradation pathway: although human is not able to catalyze formation of Neu5Gc due to the inactive CMAHP enzyme, Neu5Gc is present in food and must be degraded (PubMed:22692205). Also has N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) kinase activity (By similarity). Also involved in innate immunity by promoting detection of bacterial peptidoglycan by NOD2: acts by catalyzing phosphorylation of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a fragment of bacterial peptidoglycan, to generate 6-O-phospho-muramyl dipeptide, which acts as a direct ligand for NOD2 (PubMed:36002575).
