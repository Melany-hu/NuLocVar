UniprotID	P02763
Accession	P02763;B7ZKQ5;Q5T539;Q5U067;Q8TC16
EntryName	A1AG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (AGP 1) (Orosomucoid-1) (OMD 1)
GeneName	ORM1 AGP1
Length	201
Function	Functions as a transport protein in the blood stream. Binds various ligands in the interior of its beta-barrel domain. Also binds synthetic drugs and influences their distribution and availability in the body. Appears to function in modulating the activity of the immune system during the acute-phase reaction.
