EntryName	IKZF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-binding protein Ikaros (Ikaros family zinc finger protein 1) (Lymphoid transcription factor LyF-1)
GeneName	IKZF1 IK1 IKAROS LYF1 ZNFN1A1
Length	519
Function	Transcription regulator of hematopoietic cell differentiation (PubMed:17934067). Binds gamma-satellite DNA (PubMed:17135265, PubMed:19141594). Plays a role in the development of lymphocytes, B- and T-cells. Binds and activates the enhancer (delta-A element) of the CD3-delta gene. Repressor of the TDT (fikzfterminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase) gene during thymocyte differentiation. Regulates transcription through association with both HDAC-dependent and HDAC-independent complexes. Targets the 2 chromatin-remodeling complexes, NuRD and BAF (SWI/SNF), in a single complex (PYR complex), to the beta-globin locus in adult erythrocytes. Increases normal apoptosis in adult erythroid cells. Confers early temporal competence to retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) (By similarity). Function is isoform-specific and is modulated by dominant-negative inactive isoforms (PubMed:17135265, PubMed:17934067).
