UniprotID	Q6K0P9
Accession	Q6K0P9;Q5T3W6;Q6K0P6;Q6K0P7;Q6K0P8;Q8WW65
EntryName	IFIX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein 1 (Interferon-inducible protein X)
GeneName	PYHIN1 IFIX
Length	492
Function	Major mediator of the tumor suppressor activity of IFN in breast cancer cells. Promotes ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MDM2, which leads to p53/TP53 stabilization. Promotes ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of HDAC1, which in turn enhances maspin expression, and impairs invasive activity of cancer cells.
