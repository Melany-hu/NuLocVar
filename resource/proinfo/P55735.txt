UniprotID	P55735
Accession	P55735;A8MV37;B4DXJ1;Q5BJF0;Q9BRM6;Q9BUG7
EntryName	SEC13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein SEC13 homolog (GATOR2 complex protein SEC13) (SEC13-like protein 1) (SEC13-related protein)
GeneName	SEC13 D3S1231E SEC13A SEC13L1 SEC13R
Length	322
Function	Functions as a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the COPII coat (PubMed:8972206). At the endoplasmic reticulum, SEC13 is involved in the biogenesis of COPII-coated vesicles (PubMed:8972206). Required for the exit of adipsin (CFD/ADN), an adipocyte-secreted protein from the endoplasmic reticulum (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; COPII-coated vesicle membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Nucleus; Nuclear pore complex; Lysosome membrane
