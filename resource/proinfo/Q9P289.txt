EntryName	STK26_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase 26 (EC 2.7.11.1) (MST3 and SOK1-related kinase) (Mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 4) (MST-4) (STE20-like kinase MST4) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase MASK)
GeneName	STK26 MASK MST4
Length	416
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase that acts as a mediator of cell growth (PubMed:11641781, PubMed:17360971). Modulates apoptosis (PubMed:11641781, PubMed:17360971). In association with STK24 negatively regulates Golgi reorientation in polarized cell migration upon RHO activation (PubMed:27807006). Phosphorylates ATG4B at 'Ser-383', thereby increasing autophagic flux (PubMed:29232556). Part of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. STRIPAK complexes have critical roles in protein (de)phosphorylation and are regulators of multiple signaling pathways including Hippo, MAPK, nuclear receptor and cytoskeleton remodeling. Different types of STRIPAK complexes are involved in a variety of biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism and immune regulation (PubMed:18782753).
