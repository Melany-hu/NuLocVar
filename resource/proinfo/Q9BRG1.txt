UniprotID	Q9BRG1
Accession	Q9BRG1;B2R581
EntryName	VPS25_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vacuolar protein-sorting-associated protein 25 (hVps25) (Dermal papilla-derived protein 9) (ELL-associated protein of 20 kDa) (ESCRT-II complex subunit VPS25)
GeneName	VPS25 DERP9 EAP20
Length	176
Function	Component of the ESCRT-II complex (endosomal sorting complex required for transport II), which is required for multivesicular body (MVB) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. The MVB pathway mediates delivery of transmembrane proteins into the lumen of the lysosome for degradation. The ESCRT-II complex is probably involved in the recruitment of the ESCRT-III complex. The ESCRT-II complex may also play a role in transcription regulation, possibly via its interaction with ELL. The ESCRT-II complex may be involved in facilitating the budding of certain RNA viruses.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Endosome membrane; Nucleus; Nucleoplasm
