UniprotID	Q08623
Accession	Q08623;B2R7X6;B4DV93;B7Z6Q3;E9PAV8;F5GWZ2;Q53F84;Q96EB8
EntryName	HDHD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pseudouridine-5'-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.96) (Haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain-containing protein 1) (Haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain-containing protein 1A) (Protein GS1) (Pseudouridine-5'-monophosphatase) (5'-PsiMPase)
GeneName	PUDP DXF68S1E FAM16AX GS1 HDHD1 HDHD1A
Length	228
