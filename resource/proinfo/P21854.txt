UniprotID	P21854
Accession	P21854
EntryName	CD72_HUMAN
ProteinName	B-cell differentiation antigen CD72 (Lyb-2) (CD antigen CD72)
GeneName	CD72
Length	359
Function	Co-receptor of B cell receptor (BCR) that plays both positive and negative roles on B-cell functions. Recognizes the Sm/ribonucleoprotein (RNP) self-antigen ligand, and coligation of CD72 and BCR inhibits BCR signaling. Mechanistically, ligand binding leads to the recruitment of PTPN6/SHP-1 to the BCR complex which is inhibitory to BCR signaling. Also acts as a ligand for CD5 and thereby plays a critical role in maintaining regulatory T and B-cell homeostasis.
