UniprotID	Q9UKF7
Accession	Q9UKF7;A8K473;J3QR20;Q96I07
EntryName	PITC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytoplasmic phosphatidylinositol transfer protein 1 (Mammalian rdgB homolog beta) (M-rdgB beta) (MrdgBbeta) (Retinal degeneration B homolog beta) (RdgBbeta)
GeneName	PITPNC1
Length	332
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidic acid (PA) between membranes (PubMed:10531358, PubMed:22822086). Binds PA derived from the phospholipase D signaling pathway and among the cellular PA species, preferably binds to the C16:0/16:1 and C16:1/18:1 PA species (PubMed:22822086).
