EntryName	SOX10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor SOX-10
GeneName	SOX10
Length	466
Function	Transcription factor that plays a central role in developing and mature glia (By similarity). Specifically activates expression of myelin genes, during oligodendrocyte (OL) maturation, such as DUSP15 and MYRF, thereby playing a central role in oligodendrocyte maturation and CNS myelination (By similarity). Once induced, MYRF cooperates with SOX10 to implement the myelination program (By similarity). Transcriptional activator of MITF, acting synergistically with PAX3 (PubMed:21965087). Transcriptional activator of MBP, via binding to the gene promoter (By similarity).
