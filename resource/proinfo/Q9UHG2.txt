UniprotID	Q9UHG2
Accession	Q9UHG2;Q4VC04
EntryName	PCS1N_HUMAN
ProteinName	ProSAAS (Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 inhibitor) (Proprotein convertase 1 inhibitor) (pro-SAAS) [Cleaved into: KEP; Big SAAS (b-SAAS); Little SAAS (l-SAAS) (N-proSAAS); Big PEN-LEN (b-PEN-LEN) (SAAS CT(1-49)); PEN; Little LEN (l-LEN); Big LEN (b-LEN) (SAAS CT(25-40))]
GeneName	PCSK1N
Length	260
Function	May function in the control of the neuroendocrine secretory pathway. Proposed be a specific endogenous inhibitor of PCSK1. ProSAAS and Big PEN-LEN, both containing the C-terminal inhibitory domain, but not the further processed peptides reduce PCSK1 activity in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. It reduces the activity of the 84 kDa form but not the autocatalytically derived 66 kDa form of PCSK1. Subsequent processing of proSAAS may eliminate the inhibition. Slows down convertase-mediated processing of proopiomelanocortin and proenkephalin. May control the intracellular timing of PCSK1 rather than its total level of activity (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network
