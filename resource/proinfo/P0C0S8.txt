UniprotID	P0C0S8
Accession	P0C0S8;P02261;Q2M1R2;Q76PA6
EntryName	H2A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A type 1 (H2A.1) (Histone H2A/ptl)
GeneName	H2AC11 H2AFP HIST1H2AG; H2AC13 H2AFC HIST1H2AI; H2AC15 H2AFD HIST1H2AK; H2AC16 H2AFI HIST1H2AL; H2AC17 H2AFN HIST1H2AM
Length	130
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
