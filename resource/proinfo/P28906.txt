UniprotID	P28906
Accession	P28906;A8K664;Q15970;Q15971;Q5JTA3;Q5JTA4;Q9UJB1
EntryName	CD34_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen CD34 (CD antigen CD34)
GeneName	CD34
Length	385
Function	Possible adhesion molecule with a role in early hematopoiesis by mediating the attachment of stem cells to the bone marrow extracellular matrix or directly to stromal cells. Could act as a scaffold for the attachment of lineage specific glycans, allowing stem cells to bind to lectins expressed by stromal cells or other marrow components. Presents carbohydrate ligands to selectins.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
