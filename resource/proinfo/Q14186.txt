EntryName	TFDP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor Dp-1 (DRTF1-polypeptide 1) (DRTF1) (E2F dimerization partner 1)
GeneName	TFDP1 DP1
Length	410
Function	Can stimulate E2F-dependent transcription. Binds DNA cooperatively with E2F family members through the E2 recognition site, 5'-TTTCCGC-3', found in the promoter region of a number of genes whose products are involved in cell cycle regulation or in DNA replication (PubMed:7739537, PubMed:8405995). The E2F1:DP complex appears to mediate both cell proliferation and apoptosis. Blocks adipocyte differentiation by repressing CEBPA binding to its target gene promoters (PubMed:20176812).
