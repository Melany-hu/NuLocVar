UniprotID	Q9Y5J1
Accession	Q9Y5J1;Q9H4N6
EntryName	UTP18_HUMAN
ProteinName	U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 18 homolog (WD repeat-containing protein 50)
GeneName	UTP18 WDR50 CDABP0061 CGI-48
Length	556
Function	Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome. Involved in nucleolar processing of pre-18S ribosomal RNA.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleolus
