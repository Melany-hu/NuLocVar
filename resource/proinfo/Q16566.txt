UniprotID	Q16566
Accession	Q16566;D3DSZ7
EntryName	KCC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CaMK IV) (EC 2.7.11.17) (CaM kinase-GR)
GeneName	CAMK4 CAMK CAMK-GR CAMKIV
Length	473
Function	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase that operates in the calcium-triggered CaMKK-CaMK4 signaling cascade and regulates, mainly by phosphorylation, the activity of several transcription activators, such as CREB1, MEF2D, JUN and RORA, which play pivotal roles in immune response, inflammation, and memory consolidation. In the thymus, regulates the CD4(+)/CD8(+) double positive thymocytes selection threshold during T-cell ontogeny. In CD4 memory T-cells, is required to link T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling to the production of IL2, IFNG and IL4 (through the regulation of CREB and MEF2). Regulates the differentiation and survival phases of osteoclasts and dendritic cells (DCs). Mediates DCs survival by linking TLR4 and the regulation of temporal expression of BCL2. Phosphorylates the transcription activator CREB1 on 'Ser-133' in hippocampal neuron nuclei and contribute to memory consolidation and long term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Can activate the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK8/JNK1 and MAPK14/p38 and stimulate transcription through the phosphorylation of ELK1 and ATF2. Can also phosphorylate in vitro CREBBP, PRM2, MEF2A and STMN1/OP18.
