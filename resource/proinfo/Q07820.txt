EntryName	MCL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein Mcl-1 (Bcl-2-like protein 3) (Bcl2-L-3) (Bcl-2-related protein EAT/mcl1) (mcl1/EAT)
GeneName	MCL1 BCL2L3
Length	350
Function	Involved in the regulation of apoptosis versus cell survival, and in the maintenance of viability but not of proliferation. Mediates its effects by interactions with a number of other regulators of apoptosis. Isoform 1 inhibits apoptosis. Isoform 2 promotes apoptosis.
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Cytoplasm; Mitochondrion; Nucleus; Nucleoplasm
