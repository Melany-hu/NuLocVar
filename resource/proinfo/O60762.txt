UniprotID	O60762
Accession	O60762;O15157;Q6IB78;Q96HK0
EntryName	DPM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dolichol-phosphate mannosyltransferase subunit 1 (EC 2.4.1.83) (Dolichol-phosphate mannose synthase subunit 1) (DPM synthase subunit 1) (Dolichyl-phosphate beta-D-mannosyltransferase subunit 1) (Mannose-P-dolichol synthase subunit 1) (MPD synthase subunit 1)
GeneName	DPM1
Length	260
Function	Transfers mannose from GDP-mannose to dolichol monophosphate to form dolichol phosphate mannose (Dol-P-Man) which is the mannosyl donor in pathways leading to N-glycosylation, glycosyl phosphatidylinositol membrane anchoring, and O-mannosylation of proteins; catalytic subunit of the dolichol-phosphate mannose (DPM) synthase complex.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum
