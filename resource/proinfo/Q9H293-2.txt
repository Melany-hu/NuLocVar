EntryName	IL25_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-25 (IL-25) (Interleukin-17E) (IL-17E)
GeneName	IL25 IL17E UNQ3120/PRO10272
Length	161
Function	Cytokine produced by various cells such as eosinophils, T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells or epithelial cells that plays a role in internal safety of adaptive immune responses by regulating cytokine production (PubMed:15860795, PubMed:25821217). Promotes and augments T-helper type 2 responses locally or systemically (PubMed:25821217). Exerts its activity via its receptor composed of IL17RA and IL17RB for signal transduction (By similarity). In turn, stimulates the JAK2-STAT5A pathway and promotes the secretion of type-2 associated cytokines including IL4, IL9 and IL13 (PubMed:25821217). Also induces the release of IL8, and IL6 from eosinophils through the combined activation of MAPK and NF-kappa-B pathways (PubMed:15860795). Inhibits the differentiation of T-helper (Th17) cells via the production of IL4, IL5 and IL13 (PubMed:11754819).
