UniprotID	P63279
Accession	P63279;D3DU69;P50550;Q15698;Q59GX1;Q86VB3
EntryName	UBC9_HUMAN
ProteinName	SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (EC 2.3.2.-) (RING-type E3 SUMO transferase UBC9) (SUMO-protein ligase) (Ubiquitin carrier protein 9) (Ubiquitin carrier protein I) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 I) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase I) (p18)
GeneName	UBE2I UBC9 UBCE9
Length	158
Function	Accepts the ubiquitin-like proteins SUMO1, SUMO2, SUMO3, SUMO4 and SUMO1P1/SUMO5 from the UBLE1A-UBLE1B E1 complex and catalyzes their covalent attachment to other proteins with the help of an E3 ligase such as RANBP2, CBX4 and ZNF451. Can catalyze the formation of poly-SUMO chains. Necessary for sumoylation of FOXL2 and KAT5. Essential for nuclear architecture and chromosome segregation. Sumoylates p53/TP53 at 'Lys-386'. Mediates sumoylation of ERCC6 which is essential for its transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair activity (PubMed:26620705).
