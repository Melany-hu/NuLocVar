UniprotID	P51159
Accession	P51159;O00195;Q6FI40;Q9UIR9;Q9Y5U3
EntryName	RB27A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-27A (Rab-27) (EC 3.6.5.2) (GTP-binding protein Ram)
GeneName	RAB27A RAB27
Length	221
Function	Small GTPase which cycles between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states. In its active state, binds to a variety of effector proteins to regulate homeostasis of late endocytic pathway, including endosomal positioning, maturation and secretion (PubMed:30771381). Plays a role in cytotoxic granule exocytosis in lymphocytes. Required for both granule maturation and granule docking and priming at the immunologic synapse.
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Melanosome; Late endosome; Lysosome
