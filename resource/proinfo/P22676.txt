UniprotID	P22676
Accession	P22676;A8K4Y1;Q53HD2;Q96BK4
EntryName	CALB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calretinin (CR) (29 kDa calbindin)
GeneName	CALB2 CAB29
Length	271
Function	Calcium-binding protein involved in calcium homeostasis and signal transduction. It plays a critical role in buffering intracellular calcium levels and modulating calcium-dependent signaling pathways (PubMed:2001709). Predominantly expressed in specific neuronal populations, influences synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability, contributing to learning and memory (By similarity). During embryonic development, it facilitates neuronal differentiation and maturation (By similarity).
