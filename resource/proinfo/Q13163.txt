UniprotID	Q13163
Accession	Q13163;B4DE43;Q92961;Q92962
EntryName	MP2K5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 (MAP kinase kinase 5) (MAPKK 5) (EC 2.7.12.2) (MAPK/ERK kinase 5) (MEK 5)
GeneName	MAP2K5 MEK5 MKK5 PRKMK5
Length	448
Function	Acts as a scaffold for the formation of a ternary MAP3K2/MAP3K3-MAP3K5-MAPK7 signaling complex. Activation of this pathway appears to play a critical role in protecting cells from stress-induced apoptosis, neuronal survival and cardiac development and angiogenesis. As part of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, acts as a negative regulator of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via promotion of STUB1/CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of ICER-type isoforms of CREM (By similarity).
