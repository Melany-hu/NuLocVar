UniprotID	Q9NZD4
Accession	Q9NZD4;Q8TD01
EntryName	AHSP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-hemoglobin-stabilizing protein (Erythroid differentiation-related factor) (Erythroid-associated factor)
GeneName	AHSP EDRF ERAF
Length	102
Function	Acts as a chaperone to prevent the harmful aggregation of alpha-hemoglobin during normal erythroid cell development. Specifically protects free alpha-hemoglobin from precipitation. It is predicted to modulate pathological states of alpha-hemoglobin excess such as beta-thalassemia.
