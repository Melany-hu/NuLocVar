UniprotID	Q8N370
Accession	Q8N370;B7Z6X9;C9JNU8;D3DTH9;Q5CD75;Q6IPM1;Q8NBX1;Q8NC21;Q8WZ00
EntryName	LAT4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large neutral amino acids transporter small subunit 4 (L-type amino acid transporter 4) (Solute carrier family 43 member 2)
GeneName	SLC43A2 LAT4 PP7664
Length	569
Function	Uniporter that mediates the transport of the stereospecific L-phenylalanine, L-methionine and L-branched-chain amino acids, between the extracellular space and the cytoplasm and may control the transepithelial (re)absorption of neutral amino acid in kidney and small intestine (PubMed:15659399, PubMed:30379325). The transport activity is mediated through facilitated diffusion and is sodium ions-, chloride ions- and pH-independent (PubMed:15659399).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Basolateral cell membrane
