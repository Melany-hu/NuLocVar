Accession	P43307;A8K685;Q53GX2;Q53H19;Q5TAM3;Q6IB43;Q8NBH9;Q96IA2;Q9TNQ8;Q9UN49
EntryName	SSRA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Translocon-associated protein subunit alpha (TRAP-alpha) (Signal sequence receptor subunit alpha) (SSR-alpha)
GeneName	SSR1 TRAPA PSEC0262
Length	286
Function	TRAP proteins are part of a complex whose function is to bind calcium to the ER membrane and thereby regulate the retention of ER resident proteins. May be involved in the recycling of the translocation apparatus after completion of the translocation process or may function as a membrane-bound chaperone facilitating folding of translocated proteins.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
