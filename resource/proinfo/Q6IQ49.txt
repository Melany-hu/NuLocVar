EntryName	SDE2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Splicing regulator SDE2 (Replication stress response regulator SDE2)
GeneName	SDE2 C1orf55
Length	451
Function	Inhibits translesion DNA synthesis by preventing monoubiquitination of PCNA, this is necessary to counteract damage due to ultraviolet light-induced replication stress (PubMed:27906959). SDE2 is cleaved following PCNA binding, and its complete degradation is necessary to allow S-phase progression following DNA damage (PubMed:27906959).
