UniprotID	P50616
Accession	P50616;B2R9T0;D3DTY3;Q4KMQ0
EntryName	TOB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Tob1 (Transducer of erbB-2 1)
GeneName	TOB1 TOB TROB1
Length	345
Function	Anti-proliferative protein; the function is mediated by association with deadenylase subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex (PubMed:23236473, PubMed:8632892). Mediates CPEB3-accelerated mRNA deadenylation by binding to CPEB3 and recruiting CNOT7 which leads to target mRNA deadenylation and decay (PubMed:21336257).
