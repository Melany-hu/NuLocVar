UniprotID	P05231
Accession	P05231;Q9UCU2;Q9UCU3;Q9UCU4
EntryName	IL6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (B-cell stimulatory factor 2) (BSF-2) (CTL differentiation factor) (CDF) (Hybridoma growth factor) (Interferon beta-2) (IFN-beta-2)
GeneName	IL6 IFNB2
Length	212
Function	Cytokine with a wide variety of biological functions in immunity, tissue regeneration, and metabolism. Binds to IL6R, then the complex associates to the signaling subunit IL6ST/gp130 to trigger the intracellular IL6-signaling pathway (Probable). The interaction with the membrane-bound IL6R and IL6ST stimulates 'classic signaling', whereas the binding of IL6 and soluble IL6R to IL6ST stimulates 'trans-signaling'. Alternatively, 'cluster signaling' occurs when membrane-bound IL6:IL6R complexes on transmitter cells activate IL6ST receptors on neighboring receiver cells (Probable).
