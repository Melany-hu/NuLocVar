EntryName	PANX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pannexin-1 (PANX1) [Cleaved into: Caspase-activated pannexin-1 (Caspase-activated PANX1)]
GeneName	PANX1 MRS1 UNQ2529/PRO6028
Length	426
Function	Ion channel involved in a variety of physiological functions such as blood pressure regulation, apoptotic cell clearance and oogenesis (PubMed:15304325, PubMed:16908669, PubMed:20829356, PubMed:20944749, PubMed:30918116). Forms anion-selective channels with relatively low conductance and an order of permeabilities: nitrate>iodide>chlroride>>aspartate=glutamate=gluconate (By similarity). Can release ATP upon activation through phosphorylation or cleavage at C-terminus (PubMed:32238926). May play a role as a Ca(2+)-leak channel to regulate ER Ca(2+) homeostasis (PubMed:16908669).
