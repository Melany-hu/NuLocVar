UniprotID	Q9H1U9
Accession	Q9H1U9
EntryName	S2551_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide transporter SLC25A51 (Mitochondrial NAD(+) transporter SLC25A51) (Mitochondrial carrier triple repeat protein 1) (Solute carrier family 25 member 51)
GeneName	SLC25A51 MCART1
Length	297
Function	Mitochondrial membrane carrier protein that mediates the import of NAD(+) into mitochondria (PubMed:32906142, PubMed:33087354, PubMed:33262325). Mitochondrial NAD(+) is required for glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration (PubMed:32906142, PubMed:33087354, PubMed:33262325). Compared to SLC25A52, SLC25A51-mediated transport is essential for the import of NAD(+) in mitochondria (PubMed:32906142). The transport mechanism, uniport or antiport, its electrogenicity and substrate selectivity, remain to be elucidated.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
