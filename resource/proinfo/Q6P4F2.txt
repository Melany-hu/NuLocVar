ProteinName	Ferredoxin-2, mitochondrial (Adrenodoxin-like protein) (Ferredoxin-1-like protein)

Length	183
Function	Electron donor, of the core iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly complex, that acts to reduce the persulfide into sulfide during  clusters assembly on the scaffolding protein ISCU (PubMed:28001042). The core iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly complex is involved in the de novo synthesis of a  cluster, the first step of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur protein biogenesis (By similarity). This process is initiated by the cysteine desulfurase complex (NFS1:LYRM4:NDUFAB1) that produces persulfide which is delivered on the scaffold protein ISCU in a FXN-dependent manner (By similarity). Then this complex is stabilized by FDX2 which provides reducing equivalents to accomplish the  cluster assembly (By similarity). Finally, the  cluster is transferred from ISCU to chaperone proteins, including HSCB, HSPA9 and GLRX5 (By similarity). Essential for coenzyme Q biosynthesis: together with FDXR, transfers the electrons required for the hydroxylation reaction performed by COQ6 (PubMed:38425362).
