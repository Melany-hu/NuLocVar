UniprotID	Q9Y3C8
Accession	Q9Y3C8;A8K9R1;D3DVF9;Q549X0;Q5VTX1;Q9BS96;Q9P009
EntryName	UFC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-fold modifier-conjugating enzyme 1 (Ufm1-conjugating enzyme 1)
GeneName	UFC1 CGI-126 HSPC155
Length	167
Function	E2-like enzyme which specifically catalyzes the second step in ufmylation (PubMed:15071506, PubMed:29868776, PubMed:30626644, PubMed:34588452, PubMed:35394863, PubMed:36121123, PubMed:38383789). Accepts the ubiquitin-like modifier UFM1 from the E1 enzyme UBA5 and forms an intermediate with UFM1 via a thioester linkage (PubMed:15071506, PubMed:29868776, PubMed:34588452, PubMed:38383789). Ufmylation is involved in various processes, such as ribosome recycling, response to DNA damage, interferon response or reticulophagy (also called ER-phagy) (PubMed:27351204, PubMed:32160526, PubMed:35394863, PubMed:37036982, PubMed:38383789).
