EntryName	PLIN5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Perilipin-5 (Lipid storage droplet protein 5)
GeneName	PLIN5 LSDP5 OXPAT PAT-1
Length	463
Function	Lipid droplet-associated protein that maintains the balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis and also regulates fatty acid oxidation in oxidative tissues. Recruits mitochondria to the surface of lipid droplets and is involved in lipid droplet homeostasis by regulating both the storage of fatty acids in the form of triglycerides and the release of fatty acids for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. In lipid droplet triacylglycerol hydrolysis, plays a role as a scaffolding protein for three major key lipolytic players: ABHD5, PNPLA2 and LIPE. Reduces the triacylglycerol hydrolase activity of PNPLA2 by recruiting and sequestering PNPLA2 to lipid droplets. Phosphorylation by PKA enables lipolysis probably by promoting release of ABHD5 from the perilipin scaffold and by facilitating interaction of ABHD5 with PNPLA2. Also increases lipolysis through interaction with LIPE and upon PKA-mediated phosphorylation of LIPE (By similarity).
