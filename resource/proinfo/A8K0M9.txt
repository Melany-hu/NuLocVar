UniprotID	A8K0M9
Accession	A8K0M9
EntryName	A8K0M9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Selenoprotein K
GeneName	SELK hCG_1641209
Length	91
Function	Required for Ca(2+) flux in immune cells and plays a role in T-cell proliferation and in T-cell and neutrophil migration. Involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of soluble glycosylated proteins. Required for palmitoylation and cell surface expression of CD36 and involved in macrophage uptake of low-density lipoprotein and in foam cell formation. Together with ZDHHC6, required for palmitoylation of ITPR1 in immune cells, leading to regulate ITPR1 stability and function. Plays a role in protection of cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis. Protects cells from oxidative stress when overexpressed in cardiomyocytes.
