UniprotID	P49638
Accession	P49638;Q71V64
EntryName	TTPA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-tocopherol transfer protein (Alpha-TTP)
GeneName	TTPA TPP1
Length	278
Function	Binds alpha-tocopherol, enhances its transfer between separate membranes, and stimulates its release from liver cells (PubMed:7887897). Binds both phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; the resulting conformation change is important for the release of the bound alpha-tocopherol (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
