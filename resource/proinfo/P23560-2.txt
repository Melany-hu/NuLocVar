EntryName	BDNF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neurotrophic factor BDNF precursor form (proBDNF) (Abrineurin) (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) [Cleaved into: Neurotrophic factor BDNF]
GeneName	BDNF
Length	255
Function	Important signaling molecule that activates signaling cascades downstream of NTRK2 (PubMed:11152678). During development, promotes the survival and differentiation of selected neuronal populations of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Participates in axonal growth, pathfinding and in the modulation of dendritic growth and morphology. Major regulator of synaptic transmission and plasticity at adult synapses in many regions of the CNS. The versatility of BDNF is emphasized by its contribution to a range of adaptive neuronal responses including long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), certain forms of short-term synaptic plasticity, as well as homeostatic regulation of intrinsic neuronal excitability.
