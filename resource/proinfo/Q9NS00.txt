UniprotID	Q9NS00
Accession	Q9NS00;Q96QH4;Q9BTU1
EntryName	C1GLT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine 3-beta-galactosyltransferase 1 (EC 2.4.1.122) (B3Gal-T8) (Core 1 O-glycan T-synthase) (Core 1 UDP-galactose:N-acetylgalactosamine-alpha-R beta 1,3-galactosyltransferase 1) (Beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase) (Core 1 beta1,3-galactosyltransferase 1) (C1GalT1) (Core 1 beta3-Gal-T1)
GeneName	C1GALT1
Length	363
Function	Glycosyltransferase that generates the core 1 O-glycan Gal-beta1-3GalNAc-alpha1-Ser/Thr (T antigen), which is a precursor for many extended O-glycans in glycoproteins (PubMed:11677243). Plays a central role in many processes, such as angiogenesis, thrombopoiesis and kidney homeostasis development (By similarity).
