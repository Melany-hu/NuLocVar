UniprotID	Q96IU2
Accession	Q96IU2
EntryName	ZBED3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger BED domain-containing protein 3 (Axin-interacting protein)
GeneName	ZBED3
Length	234
Function	Acts as a positive regulator in the activation of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by stabilizing cytoplasmic beta-catenin (By similarity). Involved in transcription activation of Wnt target gene expression (By similarity). Plays a role in symmetric division of blastomeres in the early stages of embryogenesis via regulation of mitotic spindle central positioning and organization of the F-actin filament network (By similarity). Plays a role in regulating the distribution of cellular organelles, via modulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and cytoplasmic lattice formation (By similarity).
