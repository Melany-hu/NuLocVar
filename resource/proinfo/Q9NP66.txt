UniprotID	Q9NP66
Accession	Q9NP66;A6NHY3;D3DW78;Q53G31;Q9NSF6
EntryName	HM20A_HUMAN
ProteinName	High mobility group protein 20A (HMG box-containing protein 20A) (HMG domain-containing protein 1) (HMG domain-containing protein HMGX1)
GeneName	HMG20A HMGX1 HMGXB1
Length	347
Function	Plays a role in neuronal differentiation as chromatin-associated protein. Acts as inhibitor of HMG20B. Overcomes the repressive effects of the neuronal silencer REST and induces the activation of neuronal-specific genes. Involved in the recruitment of the histone methyltransferase KMT2A/MLL1 and consequent increased methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
