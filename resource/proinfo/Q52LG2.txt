UniprotID	Q52LG2
Accession	Q52LG2
EntryName	KR132_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 13-2
GeneName	KRTAP13-2 KAP13.2
Length	175
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins (By similarity).
