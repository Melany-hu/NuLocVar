UniprotID	Q92844-2
Accession	Q92844;D3DPB5;Q7Z4J6;Q92885
EntryName	TANK_HUMAN
ProteinName	TRAF family member-associated NF-kappa-B activator (TRAF-interacting protein) (I-TRAF)
GeneName	TANK ITRAF TRAF2
Length	117
Function	Adapter protein involved in I-kappa-B-kinase (IKK) regulation which constitutively binds TBK1 and IKBKE playing a role in antiviral innate immunity. Acts as a regulator of TRAF function by maintaining them in a latent state. Blocks TRAF2 binding to LMP1 and inhibits LMP1-mediated NF-kappa-B activation. Negatively regulates NF-kappaB signaling and cell survival upon DNA damage (PubMed:25861989). Plays a role as an adapter to assemble ZC3H12A, USP10 in a deubiquitination complex which plays a negative feedback response to attenuate NF-kappaB activation through the deubiquitination of IKBKG or TRAF6 in response to interleukin-1-beta (IL1B) stimulation or upon DNA damage (PubMed:25861989). Promotes UBP10-induced deubiquitination of TRAF6 in response to DNA damage (PubMed:25861989). May control negatively TRAF2-mediated NF-kappa-B activation signaled by CD40, TNFR1 and TNFR2.
