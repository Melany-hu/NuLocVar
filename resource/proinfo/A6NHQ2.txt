UniprotID	A6NHQ2
Accession	A6NHQ2;R4GMW7
EntryName	FBLL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA 2'-O-methyltransferase FBLL1 (EC 2.1.1.-) (Fibrillarin like 1)
GeneName	FBLL1
Length	334
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent RNA methyltransferase that catalyzes 2'-hydroxyl ribose methylation in RNAs (PubMed:39570315). Functions as part of box C/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) complexes, where guide snoRNAs ensure methylation specificity through base pairing with RNA substrates (PubMed:39570315). Exhibits broad substrate specificity, methylating multiple sites on ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) depending on the guide snoRNA incorporated in the complex (PubMed:39570315). Specifically expressed in brain, it regulates the expression of GAP43 by stabilizing its mRNA through methylation and thereby plays an indirect role in neuronal differentiation (By similarity).
