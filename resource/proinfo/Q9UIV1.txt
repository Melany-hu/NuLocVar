EntryName	CNOT7_HUMAN
ProteinName	CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 7 (EC 3.1.13.4) (BTG1-binding factor 1) (CCR4-associated factor 1) (CAF-1) (Caf1a)
GeneName	CNOT7 CAF1
Length	285
Function	Has 3'-5' poly(A) exoribonuclease activity for synthetic poly(A) RNA substrate (PubMed:19276069, PubMed:20634287, PubMed:31439799). Its function seems to be partially redundant with that of CNOT8 (PubMed:19605561). Catalytic component of the CCR4-NOT complex which is one of the major cellular mRNA deadenylases and is linked to various cellular processes including bulk mRNA degradation, miRNA-mediated repression, translational repression during translational initiation and general transcription regulation (PubMed:19276069, PubMed:20634287, PubMed:31439799). During miRNA-mediated repression the complex also seems to act as translational repressor during translational initiation (PubMed:20065043). Additional complex functions may be a consequence of its influence on mRNA expression (PubMed:19276069, PubMed:23236473). Associates with members of the BTG family such as TOB1 and BTG2 and is required for their anti-proliferative activity (PubMed:19276069, PubMed:23236473).
