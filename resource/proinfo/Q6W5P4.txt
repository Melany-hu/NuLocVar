EntryName	NPSR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuropeptide S receptor (G-protein coupled receptor 154) (G-protein coupled receptor PGR14) (G-protein coupled receptor for asthma susceptibility)
GeneName	NPSR1 GPR154 GPRA PGR14
Length	371
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for neuropeptide S (NPS) (PubMed:16790440). Promotes mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) stores (PubMed:16790440). Inhibits cell growth in response to NPS binding (PubMed:15947423). Involved in pathogenesis of asthma and other IgE-mediated diseases.
