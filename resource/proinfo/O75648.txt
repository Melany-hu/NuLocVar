UniprotID	O75648
Accession	O75648;A8K3U7;Q05C99;Q5W9C8;Q66K31;Q6ICC3;Q9NWC1
EntryName	MTU1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial tRNA-specific 2-thiouridylase 1 (EC 2.8.1.14) (MTO2 homolog)
GeneName	TRMU MTU1 TRMT1
Length	421
Function	Catalyzes the 2-thiolation of uridine at the wobble position (U34) of mitochondrial tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln). Required for the formation of 5-taurinomethyl-2-thiouridine (tm5s2U) of mitochondrial tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu), and tRNA(Gln) at the wobble position. ATP is required to activate the C2 atom of the wobble base.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
