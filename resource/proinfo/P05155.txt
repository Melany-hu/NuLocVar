EntryName	IC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Plasma protease C1 inhibitor (C1 Inh) (C1Inh) (C1 esterase inhibitor) (C1-inhibiting factor) (Serpin G1)
GeneName	SERPING1 C1IN C1NH
Length	500
Function	Activation of the C1 complex is under control of the C1-inhibitor. It forms a proteolytically inactive stoichiometric complex with the C1r or C1s proteases. May play a potentially crucial role in regulating important physiological pathways including complement activation, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and the generation of kinins. Very efficient inhibitor of FXIIa. Inhibits chymotrypsin and kallikrein.
