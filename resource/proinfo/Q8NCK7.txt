UniprotID	Q8NCK7
Accession	Q8NCK7
EntryName	MOT11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Monocarboxylate transporter 11 (MCT 11) (Solute carrier family 16 member 11)
GeneName	SLC16A11 MCT11
Length	471
Function	Proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter. It catalyzes the transport of pyruvate across the plasma membrane (PubMed:28666119). Probably involved in hepatic lipid metabolism: overexpression results in an increase of triacylglycerol(TAG) levels, small increases in intracellular diacylglycerols and decreases in lysophosphatidylcholine, cholesterol ester and sphingomyelin lipids (PubMed:24390345).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Cell membrane
