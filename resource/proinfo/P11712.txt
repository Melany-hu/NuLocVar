GeneName	CYP2C9 CYP2C10
Length	490
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids and steroids (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:21576599, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:15766564, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:7574697, PubMed:9866708). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes cholesterol toward 25-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological regulator of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:21576599). Exhibits low catalytic activity for the formation of catechol estrogens from 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2 (PubMed:12865317). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation and hydroxylation with double-bond migration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:9435160, PubMed:9866708). Also metabolizes plant monoterpenes such as limonene. Oxygenates (R)- and (S)-limonene to produce carveol and perillyl alcohol (PubMed:11950794). Contributes to the wide pharmacokinetics variability of the metabolism of drugs such as S-warfarin, diclofenac, phenytoin, tolbutamide and losartan (PubMed:25994031).
