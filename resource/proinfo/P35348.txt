EntryName	ADA1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-1A adrenergic receptor (Alpha-1A adrenoreceptor) (Alpha-1A adrenoceptor) (Alpha-1C adrenergic receptor) (Alpha-adrenergic receptor 1c)
GeneName	ADRA1A ADRA1C
Length	466
Function	This alpha-adrenergic receptor mediates its action by association with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Its effect is mediated by G(q) and G(11) proteins. Nuclear ADRA1A-ADRA1B heterooligomers regulate phenylephrine(PE)-stimulated ERK signaling in cardiac myocytes.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus membrane; Cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Membrane; Caveola
