UniprotID	Q86YM7-2
Accession	Q86YM7;B2R688;O96003;Q86YM5
EntryName	HOME1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homer protein homolog 1 (Homer-1)
GeneName	HOMER1 SYN47
Length	224
Function	Postsynaptic density scaffolding protein. Binds and cross-links cytoplasmic regions of GRM1, GRM5, ITPR1, DNM3, RYR1, RYR2, SHANK1 and SHANK3. By physically linking GRM1 and GRM5 with ER-associated ITPR1 receptors, it aids the coupling of surface receptors to intracellular calcium release. May also couple GRM1 to PI3 kinase through its interaction with AGAP2. Isoform 1 regulates the trafficking and surface expression of GRM5. Isoform 3 acts as a natural dominant negative, in dynamic competition with constitutively expressed isoform 1 to regulate synaptic metabotropic glutamate function. Isoform 3, may be involved in the structural changes that occur at synapses during long-lasting neuronal plasticity and development. Forms a high-order complex with SHANK1, which in turn is necessary for the structural and functional integrity of dendritic spines (By similarity). Negatively regulates T cell activation by inhibiting the calcineurin-NFAT pathway. Acts by competing with calcineurin/PPP3CA for NFAT protein binding, hence preventing NFAT activation by PPP3CA (PubMed:18218901).
