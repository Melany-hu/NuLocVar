UniprotID	Q9NS66
Accession	Q9NS66;B1B0A5
EntryName	GP173_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable G-protein coupled receptor 173 (Super conserved receptor expressed in brain 3)
GeneName	GPR173 SREB3
Length	373
Function	Is a receptor for the SMIM20 derived peptides Phoenixin-14 and Phoenixin-20 (By similarity). It mediates the Phoenixin-14 and Phoenixin-20 augmentation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH) signaling in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland (By similarity). In the ovary, it mediates the effects of Phoenixin-14 and Phoenixin-20 induced granulosa cell proliferation during follicular growth (PubMed:30933929).
