EntryName	SNX6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sorting nexin-6 (TRAF4-associated factor 2) [Cleaved into: Sorting nexin-6, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	SNX6
Length	406
Function	Involved in several stages of intracellular trafficking. Interacts with membranes phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and/or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Probable). Acts in part as component of the retromer membrane-deforming SNX-BAR subcomplex (PubMed:19935774). The SNX-BAR retromer mediates retrograde transport of cargo proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is involved in endosome-to-plasma membrane transport for cargo protein recycling. The SNX-BAR subcomplex functions to deform the donor membrane into a tubular profile called endosome-to-TGN transport carrier (ETC) (Probable). Does not have in vitro vesicle-to-membrane remodeling activity (PubMed:23085988). Involved in retrograde endosome-to-TGN transport of lysosomal enzyme receptor IGF2R (PubMed:17148574). May function as link between transport vesicles and dynactin (Probable). Negatively regulates retrograde transport of BACE1 from the cell surface to the trans-Golgi network (PubMed:20354142). Involved in E-cadherin sorting and degradation; inhibits PIP5K1C isoform 3-mediated E-cadherin degradation (PubMed:24610942). In association with GIT1 involved in EGFR degradation. Promotes lysosomal degradation of CDKN1B (By similarity). May contribute to transcription regulation (Probable).
