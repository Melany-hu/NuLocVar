UniprotID	P49703
Accession	P49703;B2RC59;D3DX43
EntryName	ARL4D_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 4D (ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 4L)
GeneName	ARL4D ARF4L
Length	201
Function	Small GTP-binding protein which cycles between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound form, and the rate of cycling is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAP). GTP-binding protein that does not act as an allosteric activator of the cholera toxin catalytic subunit. Recruits CYTH1, CYTH2, CYTH3 and CYTH4 to the plasma membrane in GDP-bound form.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleolus; Cell membrane; Nucleus; Cytoplasm
