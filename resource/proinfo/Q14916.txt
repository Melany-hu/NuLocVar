UniprotID	Q14916
Accession	Q14916;A8K418;O60761;Q13783;Q3MIP5;Q5MJP8;Q5TB83;Q96KL8
EntryName	NPT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 1 (Na(+)/PI cotransporter 1) (Na/Pi-4) (Renal Na(+)-dependent phosphate cotransporter 1) (Renal sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 1) (Renal sodium-phosphate transport protein 1) (Sodium/phosphate cotransporter 1) (Solute carrier family 17 member 1)
GeneName	SLC17A1 NPT1
Length	467
Function	Important for the resorption of phosphate by the kidney (PubMed:7826357). May be involved in actively transporting phosphate into cells via Na(+) cotransport in the renal brush border membrane (PubMed:7826357). Plays a role in urate transport in the kidney (PubMed:25252215, PubMed:27906618).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane
