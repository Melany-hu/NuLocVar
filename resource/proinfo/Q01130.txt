UniprotID	Q01130
Accession	Q01130;B3KWD5;B4DN89;H0YG49
EntryName	SRSF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (Protein PR264) (Splicing component, 35 kDa) (Splicing factor SC35) (SC-35) (Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 2)
GeneName	SRSF2 SFRS2
Length	221
Function	Necessary for the splicing of pre-mRNA. It is required for formation of the earliest ATP-dependent splicing complex and interacts with spliceosomal components bound to both the 5'- and 3'-splice sites during spliceosome assembly. It also is required for ATP-dependent interactions of both U1 and U2 snRNPs with pre-mRNA. Interacts with other spliceosomal components, via the RS domains, to form a bridge between the 5'- and 3'-splice site binding components, U1 snRNP and U2AF. Binds to purine-rich RNA sequences, either 5'-AGSAGAGTA-3' (S=C or G) or 5'-GTTCGAGTA-3'. Can bind to beta-globin mRNA and commit it to the splicing pathway. The phosphorylated form (by SRPK2) is required for cellular apoptosis in response to cisplatin treatment.
