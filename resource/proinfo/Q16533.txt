UniprotID	Q16533
Accession	Q16533
EntryName	SNPC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	snRNA-activating protein complex subunit 1 (SNAPc subunit 1) (Proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunit gamma) (PSE-binding factor subunit gamma) (PTF subunit gamma) (Small nuclear RNA-activating complex polypeptide 1) (snRNA-activating protein complex 43 kDa subunit) (SNAPc 43 kDa subunit)
GeneName	SNAPC1 SNAP43
Length	368
Function	Part of the SNAPc complex required for the transcription of both RNA polymerase II and III small-nuclear RNA genes. Binds to the proximal sequence element (PSE), a non-TATA-box basal promoter element common to these 2 types of genes. Recruits TBP and BRF2 to the U6 snRNA TATA box.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
