Accession	Q9UGM5;B2RCW6;E9PG06;Q1RMZ0;Q5J876;Q6DK58;Q6GRB6;Q9Y6Z0
EntryName	FETUB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fetuin-B (16G2) (Fetuin-like protein IRL685) (Gugu)
GeneName	FETUB
Length	382
Function	Protease inhibitor required for egg fertilization. Required to prevent premature zona pellucida hardening before fertilization, probably by inhibiting the protease activity of ASTL, a protease that mediates the cleavage of ZP2 and triggers zona pellucida hardening (By similarity).
