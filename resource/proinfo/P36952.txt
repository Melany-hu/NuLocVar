UniprotID	P36952
Accession	P36952;B2R6Y4;Q6N0B4;Q8WW89
EntryName	SPB5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serpin B5 (Maspin) (Peptidase inhibitor 5) (PI-5)
GeneName	SERPINB5 PI5
Length	375
Function	Tumor suppressor. It blocks the growth, invasion, and metastatic properties of mammary tumors. As it does not undergo the S (stressed) to R (relaxed) conformational transition characteristic of active serpins, it exhibits no serine protease inhibitory activity.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Extracellular space
