UniprotID	Q5XKP0
Accession	Q5XKP0;A0A0B4J2A5;K7EKR0;Q86YE5
EntryName	MIC13_HUMAN
ProteinName	MICOS complex subunit MIC13 (Protein P117)
GeneName	MICOS13 C19orf70 MIC13 QIL1
Length	118
Function	Component of the MICOS complex, a large protein complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane that plays crucial roles in the maintenance of crista junctions, inner membrane architecture, and formation of contact sites to the outer membrane (PubMed:25997101, PubMed:27623147, PubMed:32567732). Constituent of mature MICOS complex, it is required for the formation of cristae junction (CJ) and maintenance of cristae morphology (PubMed:25997101, PubMed:27623147, PubMed:32567732). Required for the incorporation of MICOS10/MIC10 into the MICOS complex (PubMed:25997101, PubMed:27623147).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
