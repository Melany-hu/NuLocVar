UniprotID	Q9NX14
Accession	Q9NX14;Q5JRR3;Q5JRR4;Q6IAB6;Q8WZ96;Q9BXX9
EntryName	NDUBB_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 11, mitochondrial (Complex I-ESSS) (CI-ESSS) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase ESSS subunit) (Neuronal protein 17.3) (Np17.3) (p17.3)
GeneName	NDUFB11 UNQ111/PRO1064
Length	153
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
