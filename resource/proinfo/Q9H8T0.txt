UniprotID	Q9H8T0
Accession	Q9H8T0;Q503B1;Q53H38
EntryName	AKTIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	AKT-interacting protein (Ft1) (Fused toes protein homolog)
GeneName	AKTIP FTS
Length	292
Function	Component of the FTS/Hook/FHIP complex (FHF complex) (PubMed:32073997). The FHF complex may function to promote vesicle trafficking and/or fusion via the homotypic vesicular protein sorting complex (the HOPS complex). Regulates apoptosis by enhancing phosphorylation and activation of AKT1. Increases release of TNFSF6 via the AKT1/GSK3B/NFATC1 signaling cascade. FHF complex promotes the distribution of AP-4 complex to the perinuclear area of the cell (PubMed:32073997).
