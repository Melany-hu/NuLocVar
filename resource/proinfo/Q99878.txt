UniprotID	Q99878
Accession	Q99878;A2RUU6;Q5JXQ5
EntryName	H2A1J_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A type 1-J (Histone H2A/e)
GeneName	H2AC14 H2AFE HIST1H2AJ
Length	128
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
