UniprotID	P25685
Accession	P25685;B4DX52
EntryName	DNJB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 1 (DnaJ protein homolog 1) (Heat shock 40 kDa protein 1) (HSP40) (Heat shock protein 40) (Human DnaJ protein 1) (hDj-1)
GeneName	DNAJB1 DNAJ1 HDJ1 HSPF1
Length	340
Function	Interacts with HSP70 and can stimulate its ATPase activity. Stimulates the association between HSC70 and HIP. Negatively regulates heat shock-induced HSF1 transcriptional activity during the attenuation and recovery phase period of the heat shock response (PubMed:9499401). Stimulates ATP hydrolysis and the folding of unfolded proteins mediated by HSPA1A/B (in vitro) (PubMed:24318877).
