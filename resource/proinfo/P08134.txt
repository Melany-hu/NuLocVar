UniprotID	P08134
Accession	P08134;B3KSW1;Q6ICN3
EntryName	RHOC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoC (Rho cDNA clone 9) (h9)
GeneName	RHOC ARH9 ARHC
Length	193
Function	Regulates a signal transduction pathway linking plasma membrane receptors to the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers. Serves as a microtubule-dependent signal that is required for the myosin contractile ring formation during cell cycle cytokinesis. Regulates apical junction formation in bronchial epithelial cells.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cleavage furrow
