UniprotID	O43559
Accession	O43559;Q5T3D5
EntryName	FRS3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 3 (FGFR substrate 3) (FGFR-signaling adaptor SNT2) (Suc1-associated neurotrophic factor target 2) (SNT-2)
GeneName	FRS3
Length	492
Function	Adapter protein that links FGF and NGF receptors to downstream signaling pathways. Involved in the activation of MAP kinases. Down-regulates ERK2 signaling by interfering with the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of ERK2.
