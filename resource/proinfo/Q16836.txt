UniprotID	Q16836
Accession	Q16836;J3KQ17;O00324;O00397;O00753;Q4W5B4
EntryName	HCDH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, mitochondrial (HCDH) (EC 1.1.1.35) (Medium and short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase) (Short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase)
GeneName	HADH HAD HAD1 HADHSC SCHAD
Length	314
Function	Mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation enzyme that catalyzes the third step of the beta-oxidation cycle for medium and short-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acyl-CoAs (C4 to C10) (PubMed:10231530, PubMed:11489939, PubMed:16725361). Plays a role in the control of insulin secretion by inhibiting the activation of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (GLUD1), an enzyme that has an important role in regulating amino acid-induced insulin secretion (By similarity). Plays a role in the maintenance of normal spermatogenesis through the reduction of fatty acid accumulation in the testes (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
