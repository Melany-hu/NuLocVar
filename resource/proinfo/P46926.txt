UniprotID	P46926
Accession	P46926;B7Z3X4;D3DQE7
EntryName	GNPI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 1 (GlcN6P deaminase 1) (EC 3.5.99.6) (Glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase 1) (Protein oscillin)
GeneName	GNPDA1 GNPI HLN KIAA0060
Length	289
Function	Catalyzes the reversible conversion of alpha-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN-6P) into beta-D-fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6P) and ammonium ion, a regulatory reaction step in de novo uridine diphosphate-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) biosynthesis via hexosamine pathway. Deamination is coupled to aldo-keto isomerization mediating the metabolic flux from UDP-GlcNAc toward Fru-6P. At high ammonium level can drive amination and isomerization of Fru-6P toward hexosamines and UDP-GlcNAc synthesis (PubMed:21807125, PubMed:26887390). Has a role in fine tuning the metabolic fluctuations of cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc and their effects on hyaluronan synthesis that occur during tissue remodeling (PubMed:26887390). Seems to trigger calcium oscillations in mammalian eggs. These oscillations serve as the essential trigger for egg activation and early development of the embryo (By similarity).
