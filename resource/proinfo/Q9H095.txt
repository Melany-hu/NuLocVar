EntryName	DRC9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynein regulatory complex protein 9 (IQ domain-containing protein G)
GeneName	IQCG DRC9
Length	443
Function	Component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), a key regulator of ciliary/flagellar motility which maintains the alignment and integrity of the distal axoneme and regulates microtubule sliding in motile axonemes. Binds calmodulin when cellular Ca(2+) levels are low and thereby contributes to the regulation of calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMK4) activity; contributes to the regulation of CAMK4 signaling cascades. Required for normal axoneme assembly in sperm flagella, normal sperm tail formation and for male fertility.
