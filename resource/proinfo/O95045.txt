UniprotID	O95045
Accession	O95045;B3KV87
EntryName	UPP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Uridine phosphorylase 2 (UPase 2) (UrdPase 2) (EC 2.4.2.3)
GeneName	UPP2
Length	317
Function	Catalyzes the reversible phosphorylytic cleavage of uridine to uracil and ribose-1-phosphate which can then be utilized as carbon and energy sources or in the rescue of pyrimidine bases for nucleotide synthesis (PubMed:12849978, PubMed:21855639). Shows broad substrate specificity and can also accept deoxyuridine and other analogous compounds (PubMed:12849978).
