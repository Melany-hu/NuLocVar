EntryName	GDNF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (hGDNF) (Astrocyte-derived trophic factor) (ATF)
GeneName	GDNF
Length	211
Function	Neurotrophic factor that enhances survival and morphological differentiation of dopaminergic neurons and increases their high-affinity dopamine uptake (PubMed:8493557). Acts by binding to its coreceptor, GFRA1, leading to autophosphorylation and activation of the RET receptor (PubMed:10829012, PubMed:25242331, PubMed:31535977). Involved in the development of the neural crest (PubMed:15242795).
