UniprotID	P29279
Accession	P29279;E1P578;Q6LCY0;Q96A79;Q96QX2;Q9UDL6
EntryName	CCN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	CCN family member 2 (Cellular communication network factor 2) (Connective tissue growth factor) (Hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific protein 24) (Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 8) (IBP-8) (IGF-binding protein 8) (IGFBP-8)
GeneName	CCN2 CTGF HCS24 IGFBP8
Length	349
Function	Major connective tissue mitoattractant secreted by vascular endothelial cells. Promotes proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes. Mediates heparin- and divalent cation-dependent cell adhesion in many cell types including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, endothelial and epithelial cells. Enhances fibroblast growth factor-induced DNA synthesis.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Extracellular space; Extracellular matrix; Secreted
