UniprotID	A8MXV4
Accession	A8MXV4
EntryName	NUD19_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acyl-coenzyme A diphosphatase NUDT19 (EC 3.6.1.-) (EC 3.6.1.77) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 19) (Nudix motif 19)
GeneName	NUDT19
Length	375
Function	Fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) diphosphatase that hydrolyzes fatty acyl-CoA to yield acyl-4'-phosphopantetheine and adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate (By similarity). Mediates the hydrolysis of a wide range of CoA esters, including choloyl-CoA and branched-chain fatty-acyl-CoA esters and at low substrate concentrations medium and long-chain fatty-acyl-CoA esters are the primary substrates (By similarity). Highest activity seen with medium-chain acyl-CoA esters and higher rates of activity seen with the unsaturated acyl-CoA esters compared with the saturated esters (By similarity). Exhibits decapping activity towards dpCoA-capped RNAs in vitro (By similarity).
