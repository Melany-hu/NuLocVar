UniprotID	Q96FH0
Accession	Q96FH0;B2RXF9;Q9BT01
EntryName	BORC8_HUMAN
ProteinName	BLOC-1-related complex subunit 8 (MEF2B neighbor)
GeneName	BORCS8 MEF2BNB
Length	119
Function	As part of the BLOC-one-related complex (BORC), it plays a role in the movement and localization of lysosomes at the cell periphery (PubMed:25898167, PubMed:38128568). Associated with the cytosolic face of lysosomes, BORC recruits ARL8B to the lysosomal membrane and couples lysosomes to microtubule plus-end-directed kinesin motors, driving lysosome movement toward the cell periphery.
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane
