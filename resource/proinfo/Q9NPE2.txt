UniprotID	Q9NPE2
Accession	Q9NPE2;B2R6M8;Q4V9L7;Q9HBL4
EntryName	NGRN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neugrin (Mesenchymal stem cell protein DSC92) (Neurite outgrowth-associated protein) (Spinal cord-derived protein FI58G)
GeneName	NGRN FI58G HT020
Length	291
Function	Plays an essential role in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. As a component of a functional protein-RNA module, consisting of RCC1L, NGRN, RPUSD3, RPUSD4, TRUB2, FASTKD2 and 16S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (16S mt-rRNA), controls 16S mt-rRNA abundance and is required for intra-mitochondrial translation of core subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Secreted; Mitochondrion membrane
