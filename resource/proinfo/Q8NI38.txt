UniprotID	Q8NI38
Accession	Q8NI38;Q8NI39;Q9BRG9
EntryName	IKBD_HUMAN
ProteinName	NF-kappa-B inhibitor delta (NFKB inhibitor delta) (I-kappa-B-delta) (IkB-delta) (IkappaBdelta) (IkappaBNS) (T-cell activation NFKB-like protein) (TA-NFKBH)
GeneName	NFKBID IKBNS
Length	313
Function	Regulates the expression of IL-2, IL-6, and other cytokines through regulation on NF-kappa-B activity. Functions in the regulation of inflammatory responses. Involved in the induction of T helper 17 cells (Th17) differentiation upon recognition of antigen by T cell antigen receptor (TCR). May also regulate TCR-induced negative selection of thymocytes.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
