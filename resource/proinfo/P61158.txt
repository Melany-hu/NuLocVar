EntryName	ARP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Actin-related protein 3 (Actin-like protein 3)
GeneName	ACTR3 ARP3
Length	418
Function	ATP-binding component of the Arp2/3 complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates actin polymerization upon stimulation by nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) (PubMed:9000076). The Arp2/3 complex mediates the formation of branched actin networks in the cytoplasm, providing the force for cell motility (PubMed:9000076). Seems to contact the pointed end of the daughter actin filament (PubMed:9000076). In podocytes, required for the formation of lamellipodia downstream of AVIL and PLCE1 regulation (PubMed:29058690). In addition to its role in the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, the Arp2/3 complex also promotes actin polymerization in the nucleus, thereby regulating gene transcription and repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:17220302, PubMed:29925947). The Arp2/3 complex promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair in response to DNA damage by promoting nuclear actin polymerization, leading to drive motility of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:29925947). Plays a role in ciliogenesis (PubMed:20393563).
