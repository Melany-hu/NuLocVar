EntryName	QTMAN_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA-queuosine alpha-mannosyltransferase (QTMAN) (EC 2.4.1.110) (Glycosyltransferase-like domain-containing protein 1) (Mannosyltransferase-like protein Xa) (Mat-Xa)
GeneName	GTDC1 QTMAN
Length	458
Function	Glycosyltransferase that specifically catalyzes mannosylation of cytoplasmic tRNA(Asp) modified with queuosine at position 34 (queuosine(34)) (PubMed:37992713). Mannosylates the cyclopentene moiety of queuosine(34) in tRNA(Asp) to form mannosyl-queuosine(34) (PubMed:37992713). Mannosylation of queuosine(34) in tRNA(Asp) is required to slow-down elongation at cognate codons, GAC and GAU, thereby regulating protein translation (PubMed:37992713).
