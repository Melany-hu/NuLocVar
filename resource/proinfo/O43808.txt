UniprotID	O43808
Accession	O43808;A8KA59;Q5TFL0;Q9UGW8;Q9UGY7
EntryName	PM34_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisomal membrane protein PMP34 (34 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein) (Solute carrier family 25 member 17)
GeneName	SLC25A17 PMP34
Length	307
Function	Peroxisomal transporter for multiple cofactors like coenzyme A (CoA), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and nucleotide adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and to a lesser extent for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine 3',5'-diphosphate (PAP). May catalyze the transport of free CoA, FAD and NAD(+) from the cytosol into the peroxisomal matrix by a counter-exchange mechanism.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Peroxisome membrane
