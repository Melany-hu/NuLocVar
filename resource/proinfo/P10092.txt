UniprotID	P10092
Accession	P10092;A8K573;D3DQX4;Q569I0;Q9UCN9
EntryName	CALCB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcitonin gene-related peptide 2 (CGRP2) (Beta-type CGRP) (Beta-CGRP) (Calcitonin gene-related peptide II) (CGRP-II)
GeneName	CALCB CALC2
Length	127
Function	CALCB/CGRP2 is a peptide hormone that induces vasodilation mediated by the CALCRL-RAMP1 receptor complex (PubMed:1318039, PubMed:9620797). Dilates a variety of vessels including the coronary, cerebral and systemic vasculature. Its abundance in the CNS also points toward a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role (PubMed:3492492).
