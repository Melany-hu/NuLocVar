UniprotID	Q9Y6D0
Accession	Q9Y6D0;Q8IZQ3;Q9P085
EntryName	SELK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Selenoprotein K (SelK)
GeneName	SELENOK SELK HSPC030 HSPC297
Length	94
Function	Required for Ca(2+) flux in immune cells and plays a role in T-cell proliferation and in T-cell and neutrophil migration (By similarity). Involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of soluble glycosylated proteins (PubMed:22016385). Required for palmitoylation and cell surface expression of CD36 and involved in macrophage uptake of low-density lipoprotein and in foam cell formation (By similarity). Together with ZDHHC6, required for palmitoylation of ITPR1 in immune cells, leading to regulate ITPR1 stability and function (PubMed:25368151). Plays a role in protection of cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis (PubMed:20692228). Protects cells from oxidative stress when overexpressed in cardiomyocytes (PubMed:16962588).
