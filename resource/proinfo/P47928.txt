UniprotID	P47928
Accession	P47928;Q13005
EntryName	ID4_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-binding protein inhibitor ID-4 (Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 27) (bHLHb27) (Inhibitor of DNA binding 4) (Inhibitor of differentiation 4)
GeneName	ID4 BHLHB27
Length	161
Function	Transcriptional regulator (lacking a basic DNA binding domain) which negatively regulates the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors by forming heterodimers and inhibiting their DNA binding and transcriptional activity. Implicated in regulating a variety of cellular processes, including cellular growth, senescence, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and neoplastic transformation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
