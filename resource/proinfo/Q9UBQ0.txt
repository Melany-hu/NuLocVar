EntryName	VPS29_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 29 (hVPS29) (PEP11 homolog) (Vesicle protein sorting 29)
GeneName	VPS29 DC15 DC7 MDS007
Length	182
Function	Acts as a component of the retromer cargo-selective complex (CSC). The CSC is believed to be the core functional component of retromer or respective retromer complex variants acting to prevent missorting of selected transmembrane cargo proteins into the lysosomal degradation pathway. The recruitment of the CSC to the endosomal membrane involves RAB7A and SNX3. The SNX-BAR retromer mediates retrograde transport of cargo proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is involved in endosome-to-plasma membrane transport for cargo protein recycling. The SNX3-retromer mediates the retrograde endosome-to-TGN transport of WLS distinct from the SNX-BAR retromer pathway. The SNX27-retromer is believed to be involved in endosome-to-plasma membrane trafficking and recycling of a broad spectrum of cargo proteins. The CSC seems to act as recruitment hub for other proteins, such as the WASH complex and TBC1D5. Required to regulate transcytosis of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR-pIgA) (PubMed:15247922, PubMed:21725319, PubMed:23563491). Also acts as component of the retriever complex. The retriever complex is a heterotrimeric complex related to retromer cargo-selective complex (CSC) and essential for retromer-independent retrieval and recycling of numerous cargos such as integrin alpha-5/beta-1 (ITGA5:ITGB1) (PubMed:28892079). In the endosomes, retriever complex drives the retrieval and recycling of NxxY-motif-containing cargo proteins by coupling to SNX17, a cargo essential for the homeostatic maintenance of numerous cell surface proteins associated with processes that include cell migration, cell adhesion, nutrient supply and cell signaling (PubMed:28892079). The recruitment of the retriever complex to the endosomal membrane involves CCC and WASH complexes (PubMed:28892079). Involved in GLUT1 endosome-to-plasma membrane trafficking; the function is dependent of association with ANKRD27 (PubMed:24856514).
