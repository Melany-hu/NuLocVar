EntryName	MC4R_HUMAN
ProteinName	Melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4-R)
GeneName	MC4R
Length	332
Function	Hormone receptor that acts as a key component of the leptin-melanocortin pathway at the intersection of homeostatic maintenance of energetic state (PubMed:32327598, PubMed:33858992). Plays a role in regulating food intake: activation by a stimulating hormone such as anorexigenic alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) inhibits appetite, whereas binding to a natural antagonist like Agouti-related protein/AGRP promotes appetite. G-protein-coupled receptor that activates conventional Galphas signaling leading to induction of anorexogenic signaling in the hypothalamus to result in negative energy balance (PubMed:33858992). Regulates the firing activity of neurons from the hypothalamus by alpha-MSH and AGRP independently of Galphas signaling by ligand-induced coupling of closure of inwardly rectifying potassium channel KCNJ13 (By similarity). In intestinal epithelial cells, plays a role in the inhibition of hepatic glucose production via nesfatin-1/NUCB2 leading to increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion in the intestinal epithelium (PubMed:39562740).
