UniprotID	Q58HT5
Accession	Q58HT5;Q5JT21;Q6IEE4
EntryName	AWAT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acyl-CoA wax alcohol acyltransferase 1 (EC 2.3.1.75) (Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2-like protein 3) (Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2) (Long-chain-alcohol O-fatty-acyltransferase 1)
GeneName	AWAT1 DGA2 DGAT2L3
Length	328
Function	Acyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of ester bonds between fatty alcohols and fatty acyl-CoAs to form wax monoesters (PubMed:15671038). Shows a strong preference for decyl alcohol (C10), with less activity towards C16 and C18 alcohols (PubMed:15671038). Shows a strong preference for saturated acyl-CoAs (PubMed:15671038).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
