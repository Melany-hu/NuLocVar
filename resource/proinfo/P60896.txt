Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair (PubMed:15117943). Component of the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2), composed of at least ENY2, GANP, PCID2, SEM1, and either centrin CETN2 or CETN3 (PubMed:22307388). The TREX-2 complex functions in docking export-competent ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) to the nuclear entrance of the nuclear pore complex (nuclear basket). TREX-2 participates in mRNA export and accurate chromatin positioning in the nucleus by tethering genes to the nuclear periphery. Binds and stabilizes BRCA2 and is thus involved in the control of R-loop-associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. R-loop accumulation increases in SEM1-depleted cells.
