UniprotID	Q8N3Y7
Accession	Q8N3Y7;B4DGK2;Q330K3;Q8TDV9;Q96LX1
EntryName	RDHE2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Epidermal retinol dehydrogenase 2 (EPHD-2) (RDH-E2) (EC 1.1.1.105) (Retinal short-chain dehydrogenase reductase 2) (retSDR2) (Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 16C member 5)
GeneName	SDR16C5 RDHE2
Length	309
Function	Oxidoreductase with strong preference for NAD (PubMed:18926804). Active in both the oxidative and reductive directions (PubMed:18926804). Oxidizes all-trans-retinol in all-trans-retinaldehyde (PubMed:18926804). No activity was detected with 11-cis-retinol or 11-cis-retinaldehyde as substrates with either NAD(+)/NADH or NADP(+)/NADPH (PubMed:18926804).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
