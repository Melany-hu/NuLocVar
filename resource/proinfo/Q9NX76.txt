UniprotID	Q9NX76
Accession	Q9NX76;Q6IAC4
EntryName	CKLF6_HUMAN
ProteinName	CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing protein 6 (Chemokine-like factor superfamily member 6)
GeneName	CMTM6 CKLFSF6
Length	183
Function	Master regulator of recycling and plasma membrane expression of PD-L1/CD274, an immune inhibitory ligand critical for immune tolerance to self and antitumor immunity. Associates with both constitutive and IFNG-induced PD-L1/CD274 at recycling endosomes, where it protects PD-L1/CD274 from being targeted for lysosomal degradation, likely by preventing its STUB1-mediated ubiquitination. May stabilize PD-L1/CD274 expression on antigen presenting cells and potentiates inhibitory signaling by PDCD1/CD279, its receptor on T-cells, ultimately triggering T-cell anergy.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Early endosome membrane; Recycling endosome membrane
