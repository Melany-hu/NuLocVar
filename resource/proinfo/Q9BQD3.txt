ProteinName	KxDL motif-containing protein 1
GeneName	KXD1 C19orf50
Length	176
Function	As part of the BORC complex may play a role in lysosomes movement and localization at the cell periphery. Associated with the cytosolic face of lysosomes, the BORC complex may recruit ARL8B and couple lysosomes to microtubule plus-end-directed kinesin motor (PubMed:25898167). May be involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles such as melanosomes (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane
