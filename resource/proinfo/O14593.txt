UniprotID	O14593
Accession	O14593;O95839;Q24JQ1;Q6FGA8
EntryName	RFXK_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-binding protein RFXANK (Ankyrin repeat family A protein 1) (Regulatory factor X subunit B) (RFX-B) (Regulatory factor X-associated ankyrin-containing protein)
GeneName	RFXANK ANKRA1 RFXB
Length	260
Function	Activates transcription from class II MHC promoters. Activation requires the activity of the MHC class II transactivator/CIITA. May regulate other genes in the cell. RFX binds the X1 box of MHC-II promoters (PubMed:10072068, PubMed:10725724, PubMed:9806546). May also potentiate the activation of RAF1 (By similarity).
