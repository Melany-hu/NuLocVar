UniprotID	Q96NT0
Accession	Q96NT0;B4DJ47;Q9BR88
EntryName	CC115_HUMAN
ProteinName	Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 115
GeneName	CCDC115
Length	180
Function	Accessory component of the proton-transporting vacuolar (V)-ATPase protein pump involved in intracellular iron homeostasis. In aerobic conditions, required for intracellular iron homeostasis, thus triggering the activity of Fe(2+) prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes, and leading to HIF1A hydroxylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Necessary for endolysosomal acidification and lysosomal degradation (PubMed:28296633). May be involved in Golgi homeostasis (PubMed:26833332).
