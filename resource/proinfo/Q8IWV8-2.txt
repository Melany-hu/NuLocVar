EntryName	UBR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR2 (EC 2.3.2.27) (N-recognin-2) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase E3-alpha-2) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase E3-alpha-II)
GeneName	UBR2 C6orf133 KIAA0349
Length	439
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which is a component of the N-end rule pathway (PubMed:15548684, PubMed:20835242, PubMed:28392261). Recognizes and binds to proteins bearing specific N-terminal residues (N-degrons) that are destabilizing according to the N-end rule, leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (PubMed:20835242, PubMed:28392261). Recognizes both type-1 and type-2 N-degrons, containing positively charged amino acids (Arg, Lys and His) and bulky and hydrophobic amino acids, respectively (PubMed:20835242, PubMed:28392261). Does not ubiquitinate proteins that are acetylated at the N-terminus (PubMed:20835242). In contrast, it strongly binds methylated N-degrons (PubMed:28392261). Plays a critical role in chromatin inactivation and chromosome-wide transcriptional silencing during meiosis via ubiquitination of histone H2A (By similarity). Binds leucine and is a negative regulator of the leucine-mTOR signaling pathway, thereby controlling cell growth (PubMed:20298436). Required for spermatogenesis, promotes, with Tex19.1, SPO11-dependent recombination foci to accumulate and drive robust homologous chromosome synapsis (By similarity). Polyubiquitinates LINE-1 retrotransposon encoded, LIRE1, which induces degradation, inhibiting LINE-1 retrotransposon mobilization (By similarity). Catalyzes ubiquitination and degradation of the N-terminal part of NLRP1 following NLRP1 activation by pathogens and other damage-associated signals: ubiquitination promotes degradation of the N-terminal part and subsequent release of the cleaved C-terminal part of NLRP1, which polymerizes and forms the NLRP1 inflammasome followed by host cell pyroptosis (By similarity). Plays a role in T-cell receptor signaling by inducing 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of lymphocyte cell-specific kinase LCK (PubMed:38225265). This activity is regulated by DUSP22, which induces 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination of UBR2, leading to its proteasomal degradation by SCF E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (PubMed:38225265).
