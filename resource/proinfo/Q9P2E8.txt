UniprotID	Q9P2E8
Accession	Q9P2E8;Q4KMN7;Q86WR8
EntryName	MARH4_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MARCHF4 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Membrane-associated RING finger protein 4) (Membrane-associated RING-CH protein IV) (MARCH-IV) (RING finger protein 174) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase MARCHF4)
GeneName	MARCHF4 KIAA1399 MARCH4 RNF174
Length	410
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that may mediate ubiquitination of MHC-I and CD4, and promote their subsequent endocytosis and sorting to lysosomes via multivesicular bodies. E3 ubiquitin ligases accept ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester and then directly transfer the ubiquitin to targeted substrates.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
