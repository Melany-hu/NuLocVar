ProteinName	ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 12 (Inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir2.2) (IRK-2) (Inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir2.2v) (Potassium channel, inwardly rectifying subfamily J member 12)
GeneName	KCNJ12 IRK2 KCNJN1
Length	433
Function	Inward rectifying potassium channel that probably participates in controlling the resting membrane potential in electrically excitable cells. Probably participates in establishing action potential waveform and excitability of neuronal and muscle tissues. Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium.
