UniprotID	Q06587
Accession	Q06587;A8JZZ0;Q5JP96;Q5SQW2;Q86V19
EntryName	RING1_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RING1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Polycomb complex protein RING1) (RING finger protein 1) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase RING1) (Really interesting new gene 1 protein)
GeneName	RING1 RING1A RNF1
Length	406
Function	Constitutes one of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases that mediate monoubiquitination of 'Lys-119' of histone H2A, thereby playing a central role in histone code and gene regulation. H2A 'Lys-119' ubiquitination gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression and participates in X chromosome inactivation of female mammals. Essential component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones, rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility. Compared to RNF2/RING2, it does not have the main E3 ubiquitin ligase activity on histone H2A, and it may rather act as a modulator of RNF2/RING2 activity.
