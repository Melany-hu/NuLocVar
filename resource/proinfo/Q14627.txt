UniprotID	Q14627
Accession	Q14627;A8K7E2;O00667
EntryName	I13R2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-13 receptor subunit alpha-2 (IL-13 receptor subunit alpha-2) (IL-13R subunit alpha-2) (IL-13R-alpha-2) (IL-13RA2) (Interleukin-13-binding protein) (CD antigen CD213a2)
GeneName	IL13RA2 IL13R
Length	380
Function	Cell surface receptor that plays a role in the regulation of IL-13-mediated responses (PubMed:11861389, PubMed:17030238). Functions as a decoy receptor that inhibits IL-13- and IL-4-mediated signal transduction via the JAK-STAT pathway and thereby modulates immune responses and inflammation (PubMed:11861389, PubMed:17030238). Serves as a functional signaling receptor for IL-13 in an alternative pathway involving AP-1 ultimately leading to the production of TGFB1 (PubMed:16327802).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
