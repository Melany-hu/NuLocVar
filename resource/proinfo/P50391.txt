Accession	P50391;Q13456;Q5ISU3;Q5T2X9;Q6FH06
EntryName	NPY4R_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuropeptide Y receptor type 4 (NPY4-R) (Pancreatic polypeptide receptor 1) (PP1)
GeneName	NPY4R PPYR1
Length	375
Function	G protein-coupled receptor for PPY/pancreatic polypeptide/PP, NPY/neuropeptide Y and PYY/peptide YY that is negatively coupled to cAMP (PubMed:7493937, PubMed:7592911). The rank order of affinity for these polypeptides and their derivatives is PP, PP (2-36) and  PP >  PYY > PYY and  NPY > NPY > PYY (3-36) and NPY (2-36) > PP (13-36) > PP (31-36) > NPY free acid.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
