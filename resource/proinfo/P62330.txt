UniprotID	P62330
Accession	P62330;P26438;Q6FGZ2
EntryName	ARF6_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	ARF6
Length	175
Function	GTP-binding protein involved in protein trafficking that regulates endocytic recycling and cytoskeleton remodeling (PubMed:11266366, PubMed:16737952, PubMed:18400762, PubMed:21170023, PubMed:32103017, PubMed:7589240). GTP-bound form plays an important role in the transport of multiple palmitoylated proteins form the Golgi to the plasma membrane (PubMed:37461827). Required for normal completion of mitotic cytokinesis (By similarity). Plays a role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of stress fibers (By similarity). Involved in the regulation of dendritic spine development, contributing to the regulation of dendritic branching and filopodia extension (PubMed:14978216). Potentiates the neurite outgrowth in primary neurons by interacting with the molecular adapter APBB1 (PubMed:36250347). Plays an important role in membrane trafficking, during junctional remodeling and epithelial polarization (PubMed:36017701). Regulates surface levels of adherens junction proteins such as CDH1 (By similarity). Required for NTRK1 sorting to the recycling pathway from early endosomes (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Cell membrane; Endosome membrane; Recycling endosome membrane; Cell projection; Filopodium membrane; Cell projection; Ruffle; Cleavage furrow; Midbody; Midbody ring; Early endosome membrane; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane
