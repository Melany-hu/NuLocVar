UniprotID	Q9Y3C0
Accession	Q9Y3C0;B2RC74;Q53FF0;Q6IAI4;Q96QK0
EntryName	WASC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	WASH complex subunit 3 (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 53)
GeneName	WASHC3 AD-016 CCDC53 CGI-116 x0009
Length	194
Function	Acts as a component of the WASH core complex that functions as a nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) at the surface of endosomes, where it recruits and activates the Arp2/3 complex to induce actin polymerization, playing a key role in the fission of tubules that serve as transport intermediates during endosome sorting.
Subcellular Location	Early endosome
