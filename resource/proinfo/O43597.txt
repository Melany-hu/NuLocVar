UniprotID	O43597
Accession	O43597;B2R9J9;Q5T6Z7
EntryName	SPY2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein sprouty homolog 2 (Spry-2)
GeneName	SPRY2
Length	315
Function	Antagonist of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathways via inhibition of FGF-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (By similarity). Thereby acts as an antagonist of FGF-induced retinal lens fiber differentiation, may inhibit limb bud outgrowth and may negatively modulate respiratory organogenesis (By similarity). Inhibits TGFB-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in retinal lens epithelial cells (By similarity). Inhibits CBL/C-CBL-mediated EGFR ubiquitination (PubMed:17974561).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cell projection; Ruffle membrane
