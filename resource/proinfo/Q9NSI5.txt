UniprotID	Q9NSI5
Accession	Q9NSI5
EntryName	IGSF5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Immunoglobulin superfamily member 5 (IgSF5) (Junctional adhesion molecule 4) (JAM-4)
GeneName	IGSF5 JAM4
Length	407
Function	Provides, together with MAGI1, an adhesion machinery at tight junctions, which may regulate the permeability of kidney glomerulus and small intestinal epithelial cells. Mediates calcium-independent homophilic cell adhesion. In testis, it may function as a cell adhesion molecule rather than a tight-junction protein. It may participate in the adhesion between spermatogonia-spermatogonia, spermatogonia-Sertoli cells, and Sertoli cells-Sertoli cells (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane; Cell junction; Tight junction
