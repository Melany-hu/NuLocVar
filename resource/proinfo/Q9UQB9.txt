UniprotID	Q9UQB9
Accession	Q9UQB9;O60681;O75442;Q6AZY8;Q6DLZ0;Q9UPK5
EntryName	AURKC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aurora kinase C (EC 2.7.11.1) (Aurora 3) (Aurora/IPL1-related kinase 3) (ARK-3) (Aurora-related kinase 3) (Aurora/IPL1/Eg2 protein 2) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase 13) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase aurora-C)
GeneName	AURKC AIE2 AIK3 AIRK3 ARK3 STK13
Length	309
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), a complex that acts as a key regulator of mitosis. The CPC complex has essential functions at the centromere in ensuring correct chromosome alignment and segregation and is required for chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle assembly. Also plays a role in meiosis and more particularly in spermatogenesis. Has redundant cellular functions with AURKB and can rescue an AURKB knockdown. Like AURKB, AURKC phosphorylates histone H3 at 'Ser-10' and 'Ser-28'. AURKC phosphorylates the CPC complex subunits BIRC5/survivin and INCENP leading to increased AURKC activity. Phosphorylates TACC1, another protein involved in cell division, at 'Ser-228'.
