EntryName	YTHD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	YTH domain-containing family protein 1 (DF1) (Dermatomyositis associated with cancer putative autoantigen 1) (DACA-1)
GeneName	YTHDF1 C20orf21
Length	559
Function	Specifically recognizes and binds N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing mRNAs, and regulates their stability (PubMed:24284625, PubMed:26318451, PubMed:32492408). M6A is a modification present at internal sites of mRNAs and some non-coding RNAs and plays a role in mRNA stability and processing (PubMed:24284625, PubMed:32492408). Acts as a regulator of mRNA stability by promoting degradation of m6A-containing mRNAs via interaction with the CCR4-NOT complex (PubMed:32492408). The YTHDF paralogs (YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) shares m6A-containing mRNAs targets and act redundantly to mediate mRNA degradation and cellular differentiation (PubMed:28106072, PubMed:32492408). Required to facilitate learning and memory formation in the hippocampus by binding to m6A-containing neuronal mRNAs (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of axon guidance by binding to m6A-containing ROBO3 transcripts (By similarity). Acts as a negative regulator of antigen cross-presentation in myeloid dendritic cells (By similarity). In the context of tumorigenesis, negative regulation of antigen cross-presentation limits the anti-tumor response by reducing efficiency of tumor-antigen cross-presentation (By similarity). Promotes formation of phase-separated membraneless compartments, such as P-bodies or stress granules, by undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation upon binding to mRNAs containing multiple m6A-modified residues: polymethylated mRNAs act as a multivalent scaffold for the binding of YTHDF proteins, juxtaposing their disordered regions and thereby leading to phase separation (PubMed:31292544, PubMed:31388144, PubMed:32451507). The resulting mRNA-YTHDF complexes then partition into different endogenous phase-separated membraneless compartments, such as P-bodies, stress granules or neuronal RNA granules (PubMed:31292544).
