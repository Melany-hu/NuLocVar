UniprotID	P50213
Accession	P50213;D3DW83;Q9H3X0
EntryName	IDH3A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Isocitrate dehydrogenase [NAD] subunit alpha, mitochondrial (EC 1.1.1.41) (Isocitric dehydrogenase subunit alpha) (NAD(+)-specific ICDH subunit alpha)
GeneName	IDH3A
Length	366
Function	Catalytic subunit of the enzyme which catalyzes the decarboxylation of isocitrate (ICT) into alpha-ketoglutarate. The heterodimer composed of the alpha (IDH3A) and beta (IDH3B) subunits and the heterodimer composed of the alpha (IDH3A) and gamma (IDH3G) subunits, have considerable basal activity but the full activity of the heterotetramer (containing two subunits of IDH3A, one of IDH3B and one of IDH3G) requires the assembly and cooperative function of both heterodimers.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
