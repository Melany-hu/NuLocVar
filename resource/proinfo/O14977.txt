ProteinName	Antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZI) (AZI1) (Ornithine decarboxylase antizyme inhibitor)
GeneName	AZIN1 OAZI OAZIN
Length	448
Function	Antizyme inhibitor (AZI) protein that positively regulates ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and polyamine uptake. AZI is an enzymatically inactive ODC homolog that counteracts the negative effect of ODC antizymes (AZs) OAZ1, OAZ2 and OAZ3 on ODC activity by competing with ODC for antizyme-binding (PubMed:17900240, PubMed:26305948). Inhibits antizyme-dependent ODC degradation and releases ODC monomers from their inactive complex with antizymes, leading to formation of the catalytically active ODC homodimer and restoring polyamine production (PubMed:17900240).
