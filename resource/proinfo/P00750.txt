EntryName	TPA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) (t-plasminogen activator) (tPA) (EC 3.4.21.68) (Alteplase) (Reteplase) [Cleaved into: Tissue-type plasminogen activator chain A; Tissue-type plasminogen activator chain B]
GeneName	PLAT
Length	562
Function	Converts the abundant, but inactive, zymogen plasminogen to plasmin by hydrolyzing a single Arg-Val bond in plasminogen. By controlling plasmin-mediated proteolysis, it plays an important role in tissue remodeling and degradation, in cell migration and many other physiopathological events. During oocyte activation, plays a role in cortical granule reaction in the zona reaction, which contributes to the block to polyspermy (By similarity).
