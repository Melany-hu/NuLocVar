EntryName	TWF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Twinfilin-1 (Protein A6) (Protein tyrosine kinase 9)
GeneName	TWF1 PTK9
Length	350
Function	Actin-binding protein involved in motile and morphological processes. Inhibits actin polymerization, likely by sequestering G-actin. By capping the barbed ends of filaments, it also regulates motility. Seems to play an important role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and distribution of endocytic organelles (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
