EntryName	ZMY10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger MYND domain-containing protein 10 (Protein BLu)
GeneName	ZMYND10 BLU LUCA12.4
Length	440
Function	Plays a role in axonemal structure organization and motility (PubMed:23891469, PubMed:23891471). Involved in axonemal pre-assembly of inner and outer dynein arms (IDA and ODA, respectively) for proper axoneme building for cilia motility (By similarity). May act by indirectly regulating transcription of dynein proteins (By similarity).
