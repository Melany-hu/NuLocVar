UniprotID	Q9Y3A2
Accession	Q9Y3A2;A8K785;B4DJC6;D3DPT7;Q5VT93;Q9BS98;Q9NS31
EntryName	UTP11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 11 (U3 snoRNA-associated protein 11) (UTP11-like protein)
GeneName	UTP11 UTP11L CGI-94 HDCMB12P
Length	253
Function	Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome. Involved in nucleolar processing of pre-18S ribosomal RNA.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleolus
