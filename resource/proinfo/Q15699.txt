UniprotID	Q15699
Accession	Q15699;Q546C8;Q96FH4
EntryName	ALX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ALX homeobox protein 1 (Cartilage homeoprotein 1) (CART-1)
GeneName	ALX1 CART1
Length	326
Function	Sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor that binds palindromic sequences within promoters and may activate or repress the transcription of a subset of genes (PubMed:8756334, PubMed:9753625). Most probably regulates the expression of genes involved in the development of mesenchyme-derived craniofacial structures. Early on in development, it plays a role in forebrain mesenchyme survival (PubMed:20451171). May also induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the expression of SNAI1 (PubMed:23288509).
