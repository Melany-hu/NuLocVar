UniprotID	Q15080
Accession	Q15080;A8K4F9;O60808;Q86U56;Q9BU98;Q9NP45
EntryName	NCF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neutrophil cytosol factor 4 (NCF-4) (Neutrophil NADPH oxidase factor 4) (SH3 and PX domain-containing protein 4) (p40-phox) (p40phox)
GeneName	NCF4 SH3PXD4
Length	339
Function	Subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex that mediates the transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADPH to O2 to produce the superoxide anion (O2(-)) (Probable). In the activated complex, electrons are first transferred from NADPH to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and subsequently transferred via two heme molecules to molecular oxygen, producing superoxide through an outer-sphere reaction (By similarity). Activation of the NADPH oxidase complex is initiated by the assembly of cytosolic subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex with the core NADPH oxidase complex to form a complex at the plasma membrane or phagosomal membrane (By similarity). This activation process is initiated by phosphorylation dependent binding of the cytosolic NCF1/p47-phox subunit to the C-terminus of CYBA/p22-phox (By similarity).
