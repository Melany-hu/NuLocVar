UniprotID	Q9GZV7
Accession	Q9GZV7;Q5T3J0
EntryName	HPLN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2 (Brain link protein 1)
GeneName	HAPLN2 BRAL1
Length	340
Function	Mediates a firm binding of versican V2 to hyaluronic acid. May play a pivotal role in the formation of the hyaluronan-associated matrix in the central nervous system (CNS) which facilitates neuronal conduction and general structural stabilization. Binds to hyaluronic acid (By similarity).
