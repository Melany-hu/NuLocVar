UniprotID	Q15762
Accession	Q15762;B2R818
EntryName	CD226_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD226 antigen (DNAX accessory molecule 1) (DNAM-1) (CD antigen CD226)
GeneName	CD226 DNAM1
Length	336
Function	Cell surface receptor that plays an important role in the immune system, particularly in intercellular adhesion, lymphocyte signaling, cytotoxicity and lymphokine secretion mediated by cytotoxic T-cells and NK cells (PubMed:8673704, PubMed:9712030). Functions as a costimulatory receptor upon recognition of target cells, such as virus-infected or tumor cells. Upon binding to its ligands PVR/CD155 or NECTIN2/CD112 on target cells, promotes the cytotoxic activity of NK cells and CTLs, enhancing their ability to kill these cells (PubMed:26755705, PubMed:31253644, PubMed:30591568). Mechanistically, phosphorylation by Src kinases such as LYN of FYN, enables binding to adapter GRB2, leading to activation of VAV1, PI3K and PLCG1. Promotes also activation of kinases ERK and AKT, as well as calcium fluxes (By similarity).
