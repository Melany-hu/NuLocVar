Length	466
Function	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored autophagy regulator which exists in an inactive state under basal conditions but is activated following cellular stress (PubMed:34338405). When activated, induces ER fragmentation and mediates ER delivery into lysosomes through sequestration into autophagosomes via interaction with ATG8 family proteins (PubMed:34338405). Promotes ER membrane curvature and ER tubulation required for subsequent ER fragmentation and engulfment into autophagosomes (PubMed:33826365). Required for collagen quality control in a LIR motif-dependent manner (By similarity). Mediates NRF1-enhanced neurite outgrowth (PubMed:26040720).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
