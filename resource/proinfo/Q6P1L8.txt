UniprotID	Q6P1L8
Accession	Q6P1L8;B2R575;Q96Q72
EntryName	RM14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein uL14m (39S ribosomal protein L14, mitochondrial) (L14mt) (MRP-L14) (39S ribosomal protein L32, mitochondrial) (L32mt) (MRP-L32)
GeneName	MRPL14 MRPL32 RPML32
Length	145
Function	Forms part of 2 intersubunit bridges in the assembled ribosome. Upon binding to MALSU1 intersubunit bridge formation is blocked, preventing ribosome formation and repressing translation (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
