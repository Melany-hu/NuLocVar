UniprotID	P62241
Accession	P62241;P09058;Q6IRL7
EntryName	RS8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein eS8 (40S ribosomal protein S8)
GeneName	RPS8 OK/SW-cl.83
Length	208
Function	Component of the small ribosomal subunit (PubMed:23636399). The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:23636399). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
