UniprotID	Q9BXA6
Accession	Q9BXA6;B2R9F8;Q6ZMC4;Q96LJ4
EntryName	TSSK6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase 6 (TSK-6) (TSSK-6) (Testis-specific kinase 6) (EC 2.7.11.1) (Cancer/testis antigen 72) (CT72) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase SSTK) (Small serine/threonine kinase)
GeneName	TSSK6 SSTK FKSG82
Length	273
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase component of the sperm flagellar doublet microtubules (PubMed:15870294). May act as a regulator of sperm motility by mediating phosphorylation of sperm doublet microtubule proteins (By similarity). Plays a role in DNA condensation during postmeiotic chromatin remodeling and histone-to-protamine transition during spermatogenesis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Flagellum axoneme; Nucleus
