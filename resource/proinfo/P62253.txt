UniprotID	P62253
Accession	P62253;B2R7P2;D3DTK0;Q99462
EntryName	UB2G1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 G1 (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme G1) (E217K) (UBC7) (Ubiquitin carrier protein G1) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase G1) [Cleaved into: Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 G1, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	UBE2G1 UBE2G
Length	170
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. In vitro catalyzes 'Lys-48'-, as well as 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination. May be involved in degradation of muscle-specific proteins. Mediates polyubiquitination of CYP3A4.
