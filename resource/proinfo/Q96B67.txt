UniprotID	Q96B67
Accession	Q96B67;A8K6T8;Q9P2H1
EntryName	ARRD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Arrestin domain-containing protein 3 (TBP-2-like inducible membrane protein) (TLIMP)
GeneName	ARRDC3 KIAA1376
Length	414
Function	Adapter protein that plays a role in regulating cell-surface expression of adrenergic receptors and probably also other G protein-coupled receptors (PubMed:20559325, PubMed:21982743, PubMed:23208550). Plays a role in NEDD4-mediated ubiquitination and endocytosis af activated ADRB2 and subsequent ADRB2 degradation (PubMed:20559325, PubMed:23208550). May recruit NEDD4 to ADRB2 (PubMed:20559325). Alternatively, may function as adapter protein that does not play a major role in recruiting NEDD4 to ADRB2, but rather plays a role in a targeting ADRB2 to endosomes (PubMed:23208550).
