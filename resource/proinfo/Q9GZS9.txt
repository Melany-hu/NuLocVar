EntryName	CHST5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 5 (EC 2.8.2.-) (Galactose/N-acetylglucosamine/N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase 4-alpha) (GST4-alpha) (Intestinal N-acetylglucosamine-6-O-sulfotransferase) (I-GlcNAc6ST) (Intestinal GlcNAc-6-sulfotransferase) (hIGn6ST) (N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase 3) (GlcNAc6ST-3) (Gn6st-3)
GeneName	CHST5
Length	411
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) as sulfonate donor to catalyze the transfer of sulfate to position 6 of non-reducing N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues and O-linked sugars of mucin-type acceptors. Acts on the non-reducing terminal GlcNAc of short carbohydrate substrates. However, it does not transfer sulfate to longer carbohydrate substrates that have poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures. Has no activity toward keratan. Not involved in generating HEV-expressed ligands for SELL. Its substrate specificity may be influenced by its subcellular location.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
