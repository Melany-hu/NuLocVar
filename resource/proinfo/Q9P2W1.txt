UniprotID	Q9P2W1
Accession	Q9P2W1;C5ILB7;Q14458;Q8WXG2;Q96HA2
EntryName	HOP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homologous-pairing protein 2 homolog (Nuclear receptor coactivator GT198) (PSMC3-interacting protein) (Proteasome 26S ATPase subunit 3-interacting protein) (Tat-binding protein 1-interacting protein) (TBP-1-interacting protein)
GeneName	PSMC3IP HOP2 TBPIP
Length	217
Function	Plays an important role in meiotic recombination. Stimulates DMC1-mediated strand exchange required for pairing homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The complex PSMC3IP/MND1 binds DNA, stimulates the recombinase activity of DMC1 as well as DMC1 D-loop formation from double-strand DNA. This complex stabilizes presynaptic RAD51 and DMC1 filaments formed on single strand DNA to capture double-strand DNA. This complex stimulates both synaptic and presynaptic critical steps in RAD51 and DMC1-promoted homologous pairing. May inhibit HIV-1 viral protein TAT activity and modulate the activity of proteasomes through association with PSMC3. Acts as a tissue specific coactivator of hormone-dependent transcription mediated by nuclear receptors.
