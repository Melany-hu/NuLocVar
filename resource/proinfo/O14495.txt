UniprotID	O14495
Accession	O14495;B2R651;D3DQ52;Q5U0F7;Q96GW0;Q99782
EntryName	PLPP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholipid phosphatase 3 (EC 3.1.3.-) (EC 3.1.3.4) (Lipid phosphate phosphohydrolase 3) (PAP2-beta) (Phosphatidate phosphohydrolase type 2b) (Phosphatidic acid phosphatase 2b) (PAP-2b) (PAP2b) (Vascular endothelial growth factor and type I collagen-inducible protein) (VCIP)
GeneName	PLPP3 LPP3 PPAP2B
Length	311
Function	Magnesium-independent phospholipid phosphatase of the plasma membrane that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of a variety of glycerolipid and sphingolipid phosphate esters including phosphatidate/PA, lysophosphatidate/LPA, diacylglycerol pyrophosphate/DGPP, sphingosine 1-phosphate/S1P and ceramide 1-phosphate/C1P (PubMed:27694435, PubMed:9607309, PubMed:9705349). Also acts on N-oleoyl ethanolamine phosphate/N-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-ethanolamine phosphate, a potential physiological compound (PubMed:9607309). Has both an extracellular and an intracellular phosphatase activity, allowing the hydrolysis and the cellular uptake of these bioactive lipid mediators from the milieu, regulating signal transduction in different cellular processes (PubMed:23591818, PubMed:27694435, PubMed:9607309). Through the dephosphorylation of extracellular sphingosine-1-phosphate and the regulation of its extra- and intracellular availability, plays a role in vascular homeostasis, regulating endothelial cell migration, adhesion, survival, proliferation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PubMed:27694435). By maintaining the appropriate levels of this lipid in the cerebellum, also ensure its proper development and function (By similarity). Through its intracellular lipid phosphatase activity may act in early compartments of the secretory pathway, regulating the formation of Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum retrograde transport carriers (PubMed:23591818).
