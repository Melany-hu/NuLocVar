EntryName	SPIN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Spindlin-1 (Ovarian cancer-related protein) (Spindlin1)
GeneName	SPIN1 OCR SPIN
Length	262
Function	Chromatin reader that specifically recognizes and binds histone H3 both trimethylated at 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-9' (H3K4me3K9me3) and is involved in piRNA-mediated retrotransposon silencing during spermatogenesis (PubMed:33574238). Plays a key role in the initiation of the PIWIL4-piRNA pathway, a pathway that directs transposon DNA methylation and silencing in the male embryonic germ cells, by promoting recruitment of DNA methylation machinery to transposons: binds young, but not old, LINE1 transposons, which are specifically marked with H3K4me3K9me3, and promotes the recruitment of PIWIL4 and SPOCD1 to transposons, leading to piRNA-directed DNA methylation (By similarity). Also recognizes and binds histone H3 both trimethylated at 'Lys-4' and asymmetrically dimethylated at 'Arg-8' (H3K4me3 and H3R8me2a) and acts as an activator of Wnt signaling pathway downstream of PRMT2 (PubMed:22258766, PubMed:29061846). In case of cancer, promotes cell cancer proliferation via activation of the Wnt signaling pathway (PubMed:24589551). Overexpression induces metaphase arrest and chromosomal instability. Localizes to active rDNA loci and promotes the expression of rRNA genes (PubMed:21960006). May play a role in cell-cycle regulation during the transition from gamete to embryo (By similarity). Involved in oocyte meiotic resumption, a process that takes place before ovulation to resume meiosis of oocytes blocked in prophase I: may act by regulating maternal transcripts to control meiotic resumption (By similarity).
