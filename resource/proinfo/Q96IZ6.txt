UniprotID	Q96IZ6
Accession	Q96IZ6;A6NNC4;Q9H9G9;Q9NUI8;Q9P0B5
EntryName	MET2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA N(3)-cytidine methyltransferase METTL2A (EC 2.1.1.-) (Methyltransferase-like protein 2A)
GeneName	METTL2A METTL2 HSPC266
Length	378
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase that mediates N(3)-methylcytidine modification of residue 32 of the tRNA anticodon loop of tRNA(Thr)(UGU) and tRNA(Arg)(CCU) (PubMed:28655767, PubMed:34268557). N(3)-methylcytidine methylation by METTL2A requires the N6-threonylcarbamoylation of tRNA (t6A37) by the EKC/KEOPS complex as prerequisite (PubMed:34268557).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
