UniprotID	P51608
Accession	P51608;O15233;Q6QHH9;Q7Z384
EntryName	MECP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCp-2 protein) (MeCp2)
GeneName	MECP2
Length	486
Function	Chromosomal protein that binds to methylated DNA. It can bind specifically to a single methyl-CpG pair. It is not influenced by sequences flanking the methyl-CpGs. Mediates transcriptional repression through interaction with histone deacetylase and the corepressor SIN3A. Binds both 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)-containing DNA, with a preference for 5-methylcytosine (5mC).
