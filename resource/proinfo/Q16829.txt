ProteinName	Dual specificity protein phosphatase 7 (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.48) (Dual specificity protein phosphatase PYST2)
GeneName	DUSP7 PYST2
Length	419
Function	Dual specificity protein phosphatase (PubMed:9788880). Shows high activity towards MAPK1/ERK2 (PubMed:9788880). Also has lower activity towards MAPK14 and MAPK8 (PubMed:9788880). In arrested oocytes, plays a role in meiotic resumption (By similarity). Promotes nuclear envelope breakdown and activation of the CDK1/Cyclin-B complex in oocytes, probably by dephosphorylating and inactivating the conventional protein kinase C (cPKC) isozyme PRKCB (By similarity). May also inactivate PRKCA and/or PRKCG (By similarity). Also important in oocytes for normal chromosome alignment on the metaphase plate and progression to anaphase, where it might regulate activity of the spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC) complex (By similarity).
