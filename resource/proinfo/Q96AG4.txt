UniprotID	Q96AG4
Accession	Q96AG4;B2RE83;D3DTX8;Q9P189
EntryName	LRC59_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 59 (Ribosome-binding protein p34) (p34) [Cleaved into: Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 59, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	LRRC59 PRO1855
Length	307
Function	Required for nuclear import of FGF1, but not that of FGF2. Might regulate nuclear import of exogenous FGF1 by facilitating interaction with the nuclear import machinery and by transporting cytosolic FGF1 to, and possibly through, the nuclear pores.
Subcellular Location	Microsome membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Nucleus envelope
