Accession	Q9P0L0;A6NDZ0;D3DUI3;O75453;Q5U0E7;Q9UBZ2
EntryName	VAPA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein A (VAMP-A) (VAMP-associated protein A) (VAP-A) (33 kDa VAMP-associated protein) (VAP-33)
GeneName	VAPA VAP33
Length	249
Function	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored protein that mediates the formation of contact sites between the ER and endosomes via interaction with FFAT motif-containing proteins such as STARD3 or WDR44 (PubMed:32344433, PubMed:33124732). STARD3-VAPA interaction enables cholesterol transfer from the ER to endosomes (PubMed:33124732). Via interaction with WDR44 participates in neosynthesized protein export (PubMed:32344433). In addition, recruited to the plasma membrane through OSBPL3 binding (PubMed:25447204). The OSBPL3-VAPA complex stimulates RRAS signaling which in turn attenuates integrin beta-1 (ITGB1) activation at the cell surface (PubMed:25447204). With OSBPL3, may regulate ER morphology (PubMed:16143324). May play a role in vesicle trafficking (PubMed:11511104, PubMed:19289470).
