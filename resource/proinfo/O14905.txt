UniprotID	O14905
Accession	O14905;Q6UXT4;Q96Q09
EntryName	WNT9B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Wnt-9b (Protein Wnt-14b) (Protein Wnt-15)
GeneName	WNT9B WNT14B WNT15 UNQ6973/PRO21956
Length	357
Function	Ligand for members of the frizzled family of seven transmembrane receptors (Probable). Functions in the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Required for normal embryonic kidney development, and for normal development of the urogenital tract, including uterus and part of the oviduct and the upper vagina in females, and epididymis and vas deferens in males. Activates a signaling cascade in the metanephric mesenchyme that induces tubulogenesis. Acts upstream of WNT4 in the signaling pathways that mediate development of kidney tubules and the Muellerian ducts. Plays a role in cranofacial development and is required for normal fusion of the palate during embryonic development (By similarity).
