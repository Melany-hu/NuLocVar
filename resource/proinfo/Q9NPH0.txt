EntryName	PPA6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase type 6 (EC 3.1.3.2) (Acid phosphatase 6, lysophosphatidic) (Acid phosphatase-like protein 1) (PACPL1)
GeneName	ACP6 ACPL1 LPAP UNQ205/PRO231
Length	428
Function	Hydrolyzes lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) containing a medium length fatty acid chain to the corresponding monoacylglycerol. Has highest activity with lysophosphatidic acid containing myristate (C14:0), monounsaturated oleate (C18:1) or palmitate (C16:0), and lower activity with C18:0 and C6:0 lysophosphatidic acid.
