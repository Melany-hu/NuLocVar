UniprotID	P18146
Accession	P18146
EntryName	EGR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Early growth response protein 1 (EGR-1) (AT225) (Nerve growth factor-induced protein A) (NGFI-A) (Transcription factor ETR103) (Transcription factor Zif268) (Zinc finger protein 225) (Zinc finger protein Krox-24)
GeneName	EGR1 KROX24 ZNF225
Length	543
Function	Transcriptional regulator (PubMed:20121949). Recognizes and binds to the DNA sequence 5'-GCG(T/G)GGGCG-3'(EGR-site) in the promoter region of target genes (By similarity). Binds double-stranded target DNA, irrespective of the cytosine methylation status (PubMed:25258363, PubMed:25999311). Regulates the transcription of numerous target genes, and thereby plays an important role in regulating the response to growth factors, DNA damage, and ischemia. Plays a role in the regulation of cell survival, proliferation and cell death. Activates expression of p53/TP53 and TGFB1, and thereby helps prevent tumor formation. Required for normal progress through mitosis and normal proliferation of hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy. Mediates responses to ischemia and hypoxia; regulates the expression of proteins such as IL1B and CXCL2 that are involved in inflammatory processes and development of tissue damage after ischemia. Regulates biosynthesis of luteinizing hormone (LHB) in the pituitary (By similarity). Regulates the amplitude of the expression rhythms of clock genes: BMAL1, PER2 and NR1D1 in the liver via the activation of PER1 (clock repressor) transcription. Regulates the rhythmic expression of core-clock gene BMAL1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (By similarity).
