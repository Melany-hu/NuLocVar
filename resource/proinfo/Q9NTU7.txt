UniprotID	Q9NTU7
Accession	Q9NTU7;A8K0S5
EntryName	CBLN4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cerebellin-4 (Cerebellin-like glycoprotein 1)
GeneName	CBLN4 CBLNL1 UNQ718/PRO1382
Length	201
Function	Acts as a synaptic organizer in specific subsets of neurons in the brain (By similarity). Essential for the formation and maintenance of inhibitory GABAergic synapses (By similarity). Promotes the development of dendrite-targeting inhibitory GABAergic synapses made by somatostatin-positive interneurons (By similarity). May contribute to the function of ventral medial habenula region of the brain implicated in the regulation of anxiety-related behaviors (By similarity). May play a role in CBLN3 export from the endoplasmic reticulum and secretion (By similarity).
