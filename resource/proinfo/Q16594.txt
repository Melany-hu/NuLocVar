UniprotID	Q16594
Accession	Q16594;D3DWA3;Q5U0D1;Q9BTS1
EntryName	TAF9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 9 (RNA polymerase II TBP-associated factor subunit G) (STAF31/32) (Transcription initiation factor TFIID 31 kDa subunit) (TAFII-31) (TAFII31) (Transcription initiation factor TFIID 32 kDa subunit) (TAFII-32) (TAFII32)
GeneName	TAF9 TAF2G TAFII31
Length	264
Function	The TFIID basal transcription factor complex plays a major role in the initiation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription (PubMed:33795473). TFIID recognizes and binds promoters with or without a TATA box via its subunit TBP, a TATA-box-binding protein, and promotes assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (PubMed:33795473). The TFIID complex consists of TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), including TAF1, TAF2, TAF3, TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF7, TAF8, TAF9, TAF10, TAF11, TAF12 and TAF13 (PubMed:33795473). TAF9 is also a component of the TBP-free TAFII complex (TFTC), the PCAF histone acetylase complex and the STAGA transcription coactivator-HAT complex (PubMed:15899866). TAF9 and its paralog TAF9B are involved in transcriptional activation as well as repression of distinct but overlapping sets of genes (PubMed:15899866). Essential for cell viability (PubMed:15899866). May have a role in gene regulation associated with apoptosis (PubMed:15899866).
