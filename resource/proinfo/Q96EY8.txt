UniprotID	Q96EY8
Accession	Q96EY8;C5HU05;Q9BSH0
EntryName	MMAB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Corrinoid adenosyltransferase MMAB (EC 2.5.1.-) (ATP:co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase MMAB) (Methylmalonic aciduria type B protein)
GeneName	MMAB
Length	250
Function	Converts cob(I)alamin to adenosylcobalamin (adenosylcob(III)alamin), a coenzyme for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, therefore participates in the final step of the vitamin B12 conversion (PubMed:12514191). Generates adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and directly delivers the cofactor to MUT in a transfer that is stimulated by ATP-binding to MMAB and gated by MMAA (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
