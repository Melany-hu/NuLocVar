UniprotID	Q08116
Accession	Q08116;B2RDM9;B4DZY0;Q07918;Q9H1W2
EntryName	RGS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 1 (RGS1) (B-cell activation protein BL34) (Early response protein 1R20)
GeneName	RGS1 1R20 BL34 IER1
Length	209
Function	Regulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades, including signaling downstream of the N-formylpeptide chemoattractant receptors and leukotriene receptors (PubMed:10480894). Inhibits B cell chemotaxis toward CXCL12 (By similarity). Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form (PubMed:10480894, PubMed:18434541).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytosol
