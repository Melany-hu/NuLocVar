EntryName	PEX14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisomal membrane protein PEX14 (PTS1 receptor-docking protein) (Peroxin-14) (Peroxisomal membrane anchor protein PEX14)
GeneName	PEX14
Length	377
Function	Component of the PEX13-PEX14 docking complex, a translocon channel that specifically mediates the import of peroxisomal cargo proteins bound to PEX5 receptor (PubMed:24235149, PubMed:28765278, PubMed:9653144). The PEX13-PEX14 docking complex forms a large import pore which can be opened to a diameter of about 9 nm (By similarity). Mechanistically, PEX5 receptor along with cargo proteins associates with the PEX14 subunit of the PEX13-PEX14 docking complex in the cytosol, leading to the insertion of the receptor into the organelle membrane with the concomitant translocation of the cargo into the peroxisome matrix (PubMed:24235149, PubMed:28765278). Plays a key role for peroxisome movement through a direct interaction with tubulin (PubMed:21525035).
