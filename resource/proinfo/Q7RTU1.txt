UniprotID	Q7RTU1
Accession	Q7RTU1;B2RNZ3
EntryName	TCF23_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor 23 (TCF-23) (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 24) (bHLHa24)
GeneName	TCF23 BHLHA24
Length	214
Function	Inhibits E-box-mediated binding and transactivation of bHLH factors. Inhibitory effect is similar to that of ID proteins. Inhibits the formation of TCF3 and MYOD1 homodimers and heterodimers. Lacks DNA binding activity. Seems to play a role in the inhibition of myogenesis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
