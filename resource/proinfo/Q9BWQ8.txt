UniprotID	Q9BWQ8
Accession	Q9BWQ8;A8K1W6;B3KR08;Q9UJY9;Q9Y2F7
EntryName	LFG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein lifeguard 2 (Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2) (Neural membrane protein 35) (Transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif-containing protein 2)
GeneName	FAIM2 KIAA0950 LFG LFG2 NMP35 TMBIM2
Length	316
Function	Antiapoptotic protein which protects cells uniquely from Fas-induced apoptosis. Regulates Fas-mediated apoptosis in neurons by interfering with caspase-8 activation. May play a role in cerebellar development by affecting cerebellar size, internal granular layer (IGL) thickness, and Purkinje cell (PC) development.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Membrane raft; Postsynaptic cell membrane
