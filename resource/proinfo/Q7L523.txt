UniprotID	Q7L523
Accession	Q7L523;B2R7L1;O00290;Q15347
EntryName	RRAGA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related GTP-binding protein A (Rag A) (RagA) (EC 3.6.5.-) (Adenovirus E3 14.7 kDa-interacting protein 1) (FIP-1)
GeneName	RRAGA
Length	313
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the cellular response to amino acid availability through regulation of the mTORC1 signaling cascade (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279, PubMed:25936802, PubMed:31601708, PubMed:31601764, PubMed:38103557). Forms heterodimeric Rag complexes with RagC/RRAGC or RagD/RRAGD and cycles between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound form: RagA/RRAGA is in its active form when GTP-bound RagA/RRAGA forms a complex with GDP-bound RagC/RRAGC (or RagD/RRAGD) and in an inactive form when GDP-bound RagA/RRAGA heterodimerizes with GTP-bound RagC/RRAGC (or RagD/RRAGD) (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279, PubMed:25936802, PubMed:31601708, PubMed:31601764, PubMed:32868926). In its GTP-bound active form, promotes the recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomes and its subsequent activation by the GTPase RHEB (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:25936802, PubMed:31601708, PubMed:31601764). Involved in the RCC1/Ran-GTPase pathway (PubMed:9394008). May play a direct role in a TNF-alpha signaling pathway leading to induction of cell death (PubMed:8995684).
