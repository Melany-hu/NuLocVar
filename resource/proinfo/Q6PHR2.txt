UniprotID	Q6PHR2
Accession	Q6PHR2;B2RXK3;B4DFT0;B4DRQ7;D3DW68;Q9NPN5;Q9UFS4
EntryName	ULK3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase ULK3 (EC 2.7.11.1) (Unc-51-like kinase 3)
GeneName	ULK3
Length	472
Function	Serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a regulator of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling and autophagy. Acts as a negative regulator of SHH signaling in the absence of SHH ligand: interacts with SUFU, thereby inactivating the protein kinase activity and preventing phosphorylation of GLI proteins (GLI1, GLI2 and/or GLI3). Positively regulates SHH signaling in the presence of SHH: dissociates from SUFU, autophosphorylates and mediates phosphorylation of GLI2, activating it and promoting its nuclear translocation. Phosphorylates in vitro GLI2, as well as GLI1 and GLI3, although less efficiently. Also acts as a regulator of autophagy: following cellular senescence, able to induce autophagy.
