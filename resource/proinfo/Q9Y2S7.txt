UniprotID	Q9Y2S7
Accession	Q9Y2S7;B2R846;Q96JE4
EntryName	PDIP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polymerase delta-interacting protein 2 (38 kDa DNA polymerase delta interaction protein) (p38)
GeneName	POLDIP2 PDIP38 POLD4 HSPC017
Length	368
Function	Involved in DNA damage tolerance by regulating translesion synthesis (TLS) of templates carrying DNA damage lesions such as 8oxoG and abasic sites (PubMed:24191025). May act by stimulating activity of DNA polymerases involved in TLS, such as PRIMPOL and polymerase delta (POLD1) (PubMed:24191025, PubMed:26984527).
