UniprotID	O00299
Accession	O00299;Q15089;Q502X1
EntryName	CLIC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (Chloride channel ABP) (Glutaredoxin-like oxidoreductase CLIC1) (EC 1.8.-.-) (Glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase CLIC1) (EC 1.8.5.1) (Nuclear chloride ion channel 27) (NCC27) (Regulatory nuclear chloride ion channel protein) (hRNCC)
GeneName	CLIC1 G6 NCC27
Length	241
Function	In the soluble state, catalyzes glutaredoxin-like thiol disulfide exchange reactions with reduced glutathione as electron donor. Reduces selenite and dehydroascorbate and may act as an antioxidant during oxidative stress response (PubMed:25581026, PubMed:37759794). Can insert into membranes and form voltage-dependent multi-ion conductive channels. Membrane insertion seems to be redox-regulated and may occur only under oxidizing conditions. Involved in regulation of the cell cycle.
