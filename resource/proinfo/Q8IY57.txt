UniprotID	Q8IY57
Accession	Q8IY57;A8K5P0;B4DFU3;G3V465;Q99710
EntryName	YAF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	YY1-associated factor 2
GeneName	YAF2
Length	180
Function	Binds to MYC and inhibits MYC-mediated transactivation. Also binds to MYCN and enhances MYCN-dependent transcriptional activation. Increases calpain 2-mediated proteolysis of YY1 in vitro. Component of the E2F6.com-1 complex, a repressive complex that methylates 'Lys-9' of histone H3, suggesting that it is involved in chromatin-remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
