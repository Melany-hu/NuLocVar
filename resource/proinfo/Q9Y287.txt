UniprotID	Q9Y287
Accession	Q9Y287;Q5W0A3;Q96B24;Q9NYH1
EntryName	ITM2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Integral membrane protein 2B (Immature BRI2) (imBRI2) (Protein E25B) (Transmembrane protein BRI) (Bri) [Cleaved into: BRI2, membrane form (Mature BRI2) (mBRI2); BRI2 intracellular domain (BRI2 ICD); BRI2C, soluble form; Bri23 peptide (Bri2-23) (ABri23) (C-terminal peptide) (P23 peptide)]
GeneName	ITM2B BRI BRI2
Length	266
Function	Plays a regulatory role in the processing of the amyloid-beta A4 precursor protein (APP) and acts as an inhibitor of the amyloid-beta peptide aggregation and fibrils deposition. Plays a role in the induction of neurite outgrowth. Functions as a protease inhibitor by blocking access of secretases to APP cleavage sites.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Cell membrane; Endosome membrane; Secreted; Secreted
