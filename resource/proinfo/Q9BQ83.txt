UniprotID	Q9BQ83
Accession	Q9BQ83;B7ZME1;Q6NTG6
EntryName	SLX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Structure-specific endonuclease subunit SLX1 (EC 3.1.-.-) (GIY-YIG domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	SLX1A GIYD1 SLX1; SLX1B GIYD2 SLX1
Length	275
Function	Catalytic subunit of the SLX1-SLX4 structure-specific endonuclease that resolves DNA secondary structures generated during DNA repair and recombination. Has endonuclease activity towards branched DNA substrates, introducing single-strand cuts in duplex DNA close to junctions with ss-DNA. Has a preference for 5'-flap structures, and promotes symmetrical cleavage of static and migrating Holliday junctions (HJs). Resolves HJs by generating two pairs of ligatable, nicked duplex products.
