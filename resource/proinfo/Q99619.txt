UniprotID	Q99619
Accession	Q99619;B7Z4W1;D3DUT0
EntryName	SPSB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	SPRY domain-containing SOCS box protein 2 (SSB-2) (Gene-rich cluster protein C9)
GeneName	SPSB2 GRCC9 SSB2
Length	263
Function	Substrate recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin BC-CUL2/5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:15601820, PubMed:21199876). Negatively regulates nitric oxide (NO) production and limits cellular toxicity in activated macrophages by mediating the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NOS2 (PubMed:21199876). Acts as a bridge which links NOS2 with the ECS E3 ubiquitin ligase complex components ELOC and CUL5 (PubMed:21199876).
