EntryName	CDC20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cell division cycle protein 20 homolog (p55CDC)
GeneName	CDC20
Length	499
Function	Involved in the metaphase/anaphase transition of cell cycle (PubMed:32666501). Required for full ubiquitin ligase activity of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and confers substrate specificity upon the complex (PubMed:27030811). Is regulated by MAD2L1: in metaphase the MAD2L1-CDC20-APC/C ternary complex is inactive and in anaphase the CDC20-APC/C binary complex is active in degrading substrates. The CDC20-APC/C complex positively regulates the formation of synaptic vesicle clustering at active zone to the presynaptic membrane in postmitotic neurons. CDC20-APC/C-induced degradation of NEUROD2 induces presynaptic differentiation. The CDC20-APC/C complex promotes proper dilation formation and radial migration by degrading CCDC41 (By similarity).
