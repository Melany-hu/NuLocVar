UniprotID	Q8TC44
Accession	Q8TC44;G3V1X0
EntryName	POC1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	POC1 centriolar protein homolog B (Pix1) (Proteome of centriole protein 1B) (WD repeat-containing protein 51B)
GeneName	POC1B WDR51B
Length	478
Function	Plays an important role in centriole assembly and/or stability and ciliogenesis (PubMed:20008567, PubMed:32060285). Involved in early steps of centriole duplication, as well as in the later steps of centriole length control (PubMed:19109428). Acts in concert with POC1A to ensure centriole integrity and proper mitotic spindle formation (PubMed:32060285). Required for primary cilia formation, ciliary length and also cell proliferation (PubMed:23015594). Required for retinal integrity (PubMed:25044745). Acts as a positive regulator of centriole elongation (PubMed:37934472).
