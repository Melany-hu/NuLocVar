Accession	Q01851;Q14986;Q15318;Q5T227
EntryName	PO4F1_HUMAN
ProteinName	POU domain, class 4, transcription factor 1 (Brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein 3A) (Brain-3A) (Brn-3A) (Homeobox/POU domain protein RDC-1) (Oct-T1)
GeneName	POU4F1 BRN3A RDC1
Length	419
Function	Multifunctional transcription factor with different regions mediating its different effects. Acts by binding (via its C-terminal domain) to sequences related to the consensus octamer motif 5'-ATGCAAAT-3' in the regulatory regions of its target genes. Regulates the expression of specific genes involved in differentiation and survival within a subset of neuronal lineages. It has been shown that activation of some of these genes requires its N-terminal domain, maybe through a neuronal-specific cofactor. Activates BCL2 expression and protects neuronal cells from apoptosis (via the N-terminal domain). Induces neuronal process outgrowth and the coordinate expression of genes encoding synaptic proteins. Exerts its major developmental effects in somatosensory neurons and in brainstem nuclei involved in motor control. Stimulates the binding affinity of the nuclear estrogene receptor ESR1 to DNA estrogen response element (ERE), and hence modulates ESR1-induced transcriptional activity. May positively regulate POU4F2 and POU4F3. Regulates dorsal root ganglion sensory neuron specification and axonal projection into the spinal cord. Plays a role in TNFSF11-mediated terminal osteoclast differentiation. Negatively regulates its own expression interacting directly with a highly conserved autoregulatory domain surrounding the transcription initiation site.
