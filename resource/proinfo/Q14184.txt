UniprotID	Q14184
Accession	Q14184;A0A087WZX8
EntryName	DOC2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Double C2-like domain-containing protein beta (Doc2-beta)
GeneName	DOC2B DOC2BL
Length	412
Function	Calcium sensor which positively regulates SNARE-dependent fusion of vesicles with membranes. Binds phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner and may act at the priming stage of fusion by modifying membrane curvature to stimulate fusion. Involved in calcium-triggered exocytosis in chromaffin cells and calcium-dependent spontaneous release of neurotransmitter in absence of action potentials in neuronal cells. Involved both in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic cells and insulin-dependent GLUT4 transport to the plasma membrane in adipocytes (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasmic granule; Cell membrane
