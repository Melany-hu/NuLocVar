UniprotID	P02741
Accession	P02741;A8K078;D3DVD9;D3DVE0;Q08AK3;Q8WW75
EntryName	CRP_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-reactive protein [Cleaved into: C-reactive protein(1-205)]
GeneName	CRP PTX1
Length	224
Function	Displays several functions associated with host defense: it promotes agglutination, bacterial capsular swelling, phagocytosis and complement fixation through its calcium-dependent binding to phosphorylcholine. Can interact with DNA and histones and may scavenge nuclear material released from damaged circulating cells.
