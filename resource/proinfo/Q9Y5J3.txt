EntryName	HEY1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein 1 (Cardiovascular helix-loop-helix factor 2) (CHF-2) (Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 31) (bHLHb31) (HES-related repressor protein 1) (Hairy and enhancer of split-related protein 1) (HESR-1) (Hairy-related transcription factor 1) (HRT-1) (hHRT1)
GeneName	HEY1 BHLHB31 CHF2 HERP2 HESR1 HRT1
Length	304
Function	Transcriptional repressor which binds preferentially to the canonical E box sequence 5'-CACGTG-3' (PubMed:11095750). Downstream effector of Notch signaling required for cardiovascular development. Specifically required for the Notch-induced endocardial epithelial to mesenchymal transition, which is itself criticial for cardiac valve and septum development. May be required in conjunction with HEY2 to specify arterial cell fate or identity. Promotes maintenance of neuronal precursor cells and glial versus neuronal fate specification. Represses transcription by the cardiac transcriptional activators GATA4 and GATA6 and by the neuronal bHLH factors ASCL1/MASH1 and NEUROD4/MATH3 (PubMed:15485867). Involved in the regulation of liver cancer cells self-renewal (PubMed:25985737).
