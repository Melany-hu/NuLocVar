UniprotID	Q9Y267
Accession	Q9Y267;A0AVS9;A1L4H6;B2RCX3;Q6DJT3
EntryName	S22AE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 22 member 14 (Organic cation transporter-like 4) (ORCTL-4)
GeneName	SLC22A14 OCTL2 ORCTL4
Length	594
Function	Riboflavin transporter localized at the inner mitochondrial membrane of the spermatozoa midpiece, which is required for male fertility (By similarity). SLC22A14-mediated riboflavin transport is essential for spermatozoa energy generation and motility: riboflavin is the precursor of FMN and FAD, which are coenzymes of many enzymes in the TCA cycle (the citric acid cycle) in mitochondria (By similarity). Required for sperm motility and normal sperm flagellar structure (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Cell projection; Cilium; Flagellum membrane
