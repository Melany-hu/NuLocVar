UniprotID	U3KPV4
Accession	U3KPV4
EntryName	A3LT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase 2 (EC 2.4.1.87) (Isoglobotriaosylceramide synthase) (iGb3 synthase) (iGb3S)
GeneName	A3GALT2 A3GALT2P IGBS3S
Length	340
Function	Synthesizes the galactose-alpha(1,3)-galactose group on the glycosphingolipid isoglobotrihexosylceramide or isogloboside 3 (iGb3) by catalyzing the transfer of galactose from UDP-Galactose to its acceptor molecule Gal-beta-1,4-Glc-ceramide. Can also catalyze the addition of galactose to iGb3 itself to form polygalactose structures.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack membrane
