UniprotID	Q9Y5I7
Accession	Q9Y5I7
EntryName	CLD16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Claudin-16 (Paracellin-1) (PCLN-1)
GeneName	CLDN16 PCLN1
Length	235
Function	Forms paracellular channels: coassembles with CLDN19 into tight junction strands with cation-selective channels through the strands, conveying epithelial permeability in a process known as paracellular tight junction permeability (PubMed:16234325, PubMed:18188451, PubMed:28028216). Involved in the maintenance of ion gradients along the nephron. In the thick ascending limb (TAL) of Henle's loop, facilitates sodium paracellular permeability from the interstitial compartment to the lumen, contributing to the lumen-positive transepithelial potential that drives paracellular magnesium and calcium reabsorption (PubMed:10390358, PubMed:11518780, PubMed:14628289, PubMed:16528408, PubMed:28028216).
