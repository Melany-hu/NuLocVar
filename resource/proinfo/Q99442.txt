UniprotID	Q99442
Accession	Q99442;D3DNQ0;O00682;O00729
EntryName	SEC62_HUMAN
ProteinName	Translocation protein SEC62 (Translocation protein 1) (TP-1) (hTP-1)
GeneName	SEC62 TLOC1
Length	399
Function	Mediates post-translational transport of precursor polypeptides across endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Proposed to act as a targeting receptor for small presecretory proteins containing short and apolar signal peptides. Targets and properly positions newly synthesized presecretory proteins into the SEC61 channel-forming translocon complex, triggering channel opening for polypeptide translocation to the ER lumen.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
