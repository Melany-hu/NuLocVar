UniprotID	Q14691
Accession	Q14691;Q9NQE2;Q9NQI7
EntryName	PSF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA replication complex GINS protein PSF1 (GINS complex subunit 1)
GeneName	GINS1 KIAA0186 PSF1
Length	196
Function	Required for correct functioning of the GINS complex, a complex that plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication, and progression of DNA replication forks (PubMed:17417653, PubMed:28414293). GINS complex is a core component of CDC45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase, the molecular machine that unwinds template DNA during replication, and around which the replisome is built (PubMed:32453425, PubMed:34694004, PubMed:34700328, PubMed:35585232).
