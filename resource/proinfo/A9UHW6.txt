UniprotID	A9UHW6
Accession	A9UHW6;B4DUM7;Q8N4Q5;Q9HBL5
EntryName	MI4GD_HUMAN
ProteinName	MIF4G domain-containing protein (SLBP-interacting protein 1) (hSLIP1)
GeneName	MIF4GD SLIP1
Length	222
Function	Functions in replication-dependent translation of histone mRNAs which differ from other eukaryotic mRNAs in that they do not end with a poly-A tail but a stem-loop. May participate in circularizing those mRNAs specifically enhancing their translation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus
