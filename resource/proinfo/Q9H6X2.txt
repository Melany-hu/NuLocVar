Accession	Q9H6X2;A8K7U8;J7K7G4;J7KF88;Q4ZFV6;Q53QD8;Q96P02;Q9NVP3
EntryName	ANTR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Anthrax toxin receptor 1 (Tumor endothelial marker 8)
GeneName	ANTXR1 ATR TEM8
Length	564
Function	Plays a role in cell attachment and migration. Interacts with extracellular matrix proteins and with the actin cytoskeleton. Mediates adhesion of cells to type 1 collagen and gelatin, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and promotes cell spreading. Plays a role in the angiogenic response of cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell projection; Lamellipodium membrane; Cell projection; Filopodium membrane
