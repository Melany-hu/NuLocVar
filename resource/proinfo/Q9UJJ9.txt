UniprotID	Q9UJJ9
Accession	Q9UJJ9;B2R556;Q6XYD7;Q96L13
EntryName	GNPTG_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase subunit gamma (GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase subunit gamma) (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase subunit gamma)
GeneName	GNPTG C16orf27 GNPTAG CAB56184 LP2537
Length	305
Function	Non-catalytic subunit of the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase complex, an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) markers on high mannose type oligosaccharides in the Golgi apparatus. Binds and presents the high mannose glycans of the acceptor to the catalytic alpha and beta subunits (GNPTAB). Enhances the rate of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transfer to the oligosaccharides of acid hydrolase acceptors.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Golgi apparatus
