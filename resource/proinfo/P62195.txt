UniprotID	P62195
Accession	P62195;A8K3Z3;A8K763;O35051;O43208;P47210;P52915;P52916
EntryName	PRS8_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome regulatory subunit 8 (26S proteasome AAA-ATPase subunit RPT6) (Proteasome 26S subunit ATPase 5) (Proteasome subunit p45) (Thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 1) (TRIP1) (p45/SUG)
GeneName	PSMC5 SUG1
Length	406
Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair. PSMC5 belongs to the heterohexameric ring of AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) proteins that unfolds ubiquitinated target proteins that are concurrently translocated into a proteolytic chamber and degraded into peptides.
