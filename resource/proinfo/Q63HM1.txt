UniprotID	Q63HM1
Accession	Q63HM1;A2RUB3
EntryName	KFA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kynurenine formamidase (KFA) (KFase) (EC 3.5.1.9) (Arylformamidase) (N-formylkynurenine formamidase) (FKF)
GeneName	AFMID
Length	303
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolysis of N-formyl-L-kynurenine to L-kynurenine, the second step in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation. Kynurenine may be further oxidized to nicotinic acid, NAD(H) and NADP(H). Required for elimination of toxic metabolites.
