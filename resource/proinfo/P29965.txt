UniprotID	P29965
Accession	P29965
EntryName	CD40L_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD40 ligand (CD40-L) (T-cell antigen Gp39) (TNF-related activation protein) (TRAP) (Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 5) (CD antigen CD154) [Cleaved into: CD40 ligand, membrane form; CD40 ligand, soluble form (sCD40L)]
GeneName	CD40LG CD40L TNFSF5 TRAP
Length	261
Function	Cytokine that acts as a ligand to CD40/TNFRSF5 (PubMed:1280226, PubMed:31331973). Costimulates T-cell proliferation and cytokine production (PubMed:8617933). Its cross-linking on T-cells generates a costimulatory signal which enhances the production of IL4 and IL10 in conjunction with the TCR/CD3 ligation and CD28 costimulation (PubMed:8617933). Induces the activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:15067037, PubMed:31331973). Induces the activation of kinases MAPK8 and PAK2 in T-cells (PubMed:15067037). Induces tyrosine phosphorylation of isoform 3 of CD28 (PubMed:15067037). Mediates B-cell proliferation in the absence of co-stimulus as well as IgE production in the presence of IL4 (By similarity). Involved in immunoglobulin class switching (By similarity).
