UniprotID	P59780
Accession	P59780;B2R677;B4DGQ3;O09077;O09149;Q53H83;Q99589
EntryName	AP3S2_HUMAN
ProteinName	AP-3 complex subunit sigma-2 (AP-3 complex subunit sigma-3B) (Adaptor-related protein complex 3 subunit sigma-2) (Sigma-3B-adaptin) (Sigma3B-adaptin) (Sigma-adaptin 3b)
GeneName	AP3S2
Length	193
Function	Part of the AP-3 complex, an adaptor-related complex which is not clathrin-associated. The complex is associated with the Golgi region as well as more peripheral structures. It facilitates the budding of vesicles from the Golgi membrane and may be directly involved in trafficking to lysosomes. In concert with the BLOC-1 complex, AP-3 is required to target cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane
