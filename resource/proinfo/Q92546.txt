UniprotID	Q92546
Accession	Q92546;Q5TCV5
EntryName	RGP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RAB6A-GEF complex partner protein 2 (Retrograde Golgi transport protein RGP1 homolog)
GeneName	RGP1 KIAA0258
Length	391
Function	The RIC1-RGP1 complex acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which activates RAB6A by exchanging bound GDP for free GTP and may thereby required for efficient fusion of endosome-derived vesicles with the Golgi compartment. The RIC1-RGP1 complex participates in the recycling of mannose-6-phosphate receptors.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Membrane
