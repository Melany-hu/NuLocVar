EntryName	TIGIT_HUMAN
ProteinName	T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (V-set and immunoglobulin domain-containing protein 9) (V-set and transmembrane domain-containing protein 3)
GeneName	TIGIT VSIG9 VSTM3
Length	244
Function	Inhibitory receptor that plays a role in the modulation of immune responses. Suppresses T-cell activation by promoting the generation of mature immunoregulatory dendritic cells (PubMed:19011627). Upon binding to its ligands PVR/CD155 or NECTIN2/CD112, which are expressed on antigen-presenting cells, sends inhibitory signals to the T-cell or NK cell. Mechanistically, interaction with ligand leads to phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail by Src family tyrosine kinases such as FYN or LCK, allowing subsequent binding to adapter GRB2 and SHIP1/INPP5D. In turn, inhibits PI3K and MAPK signaling cascades (PubMed:23154388). In addition, associates with beta-arrestin-2/ARRB2 to recruit SHIP1/INPP5D that suppresses autoubiquitination of TRAF6 and subsequently inhibits NF-kappa-B signaling pathway (PubMed:24817116). Also acts as a receptor for NECTIN4 to inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity (PubMed:32503945).
