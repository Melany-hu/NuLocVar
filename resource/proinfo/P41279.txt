UniprotID	P41279
Accession	P41279;A8K2Q5;D3DRX1;Q14275;Q5T855;Q9HC81
EntryName	M3K8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8 (EC 2.7.11.25) (Cancer Osaka thyroid oncogene) (Proto-oncogene c-Cot) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase cot) (Tumor progression locus 2) (TPL-2)
GeneName	MAP3K8 COT ESTF
Length	467
Function	Required for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced, TLR4-mediated activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in macrophages, thus being critical for production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha (TNF) during immune responses. Involved in the regulation of T-helper cell differentiation and IFNG expression in T-cells. Involved in mediating host resistance to bacterial infection through negative regulation of type I interferon (IFN) production. In vitro, activates MAPK/ERK pathway in response to IL1 in an IRAK1-independent manner, leading to up-regulation of IL8 and CCL4. Transduces CD40 and TNFRSF1A signals that activate ERK in B-cells and macrophages, and thus may play a role in the regulation of immunoglobulin production. May also play a role in the transduction of TNF signals that activate JNK and NF-kappa-B in some cell types. In adipocytes, activates MAPK/ERK pathway in an IKBKB-dependent manner in response to IL1B and TNF, but not insulin, leading to induction of lipolysis. Plays a role in the cell cycle. Isoform 1 shows some transforming activity, although it is much weaker than that of the activated oncogenic variant.
