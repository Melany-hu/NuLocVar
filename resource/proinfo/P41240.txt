UniprotID	P41240
Accession	P41240;Q2M3N2;Q6FGZ6
EntryName	CSK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tyrosine-protein kinase CSK (EC 2.7.10.2) (C-Src kinase) (Protein-tyrosine kinase CYL)
GeneName	CSK
Length	450
Function	Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase that plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, migration and immune response. Phosphorylates tyrosine residues located in the C-terminal tails of Src-family kinases (SFKs) including LCK, SRC, HCK, FYN, LYN, CSK or YES1. Upon tail phosphorylation, Src-family members engage in intramolecular interactions between the phosphotyrosine tail and the SH2 domain that result in an inactive conformation. To inhibit SFKs, CSK is recruited to the plasma membrane via binding to transmembrane proteins or adapter proteins located near the plasma membrane. Suppresses signaling by various surface receptors, including T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) by phosphorylating and maintaining inactive several positive effectors such as FYN or LCK.
