EntryName	FICD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein adenylyltransferase FICD (EC 2.7.7.108) (AMPylator FICD) (De-AMPylase FICD) (EC 3.1.4.-) (FIC domain-containing protein) (Huntingtin yeast partner E) (Huntingtin-interacting protein 13) (HIP-13) (Huntingtin-interacting protein E)
GeneName	FICD HIP13 HYPE UNQ3041/PRO9857
Length	458
Function	Protein that can both mediate the addition of adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) to specific residues of target proteins (AMPylation), and the removal of the same modification from target proteins (de-AMPylation), depending on the context (By similarity). The side chain of Glu-231 determines which of the two opposing activities (AMPylase or de-AMPylase) will take place (PubMed:36136088). Acts as a key regulator of the ERN1/IRE1-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) by mediating AMPylation or de-AMPylation of HSPA5/BiP (PubMed:25601083, PubMed:36136088). In unstressed cells, acts as an adenylyltransferase by mediating AMPylation of HSPA5/BiP at 'Thr-518', thereby inactivating it (By similarity). In response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, acts as a phosphodiesterase by mediating removal of ATP (de-AMPylation) from HSPA5/BiP at 'Thr-518', leading to restore HSPA5/BiP activity (By similarity). Although it is able to AMPylate RhoA, Rac and Cdc42 Rho GTPases in vitro, Rho GTPases do not constitute physiological substrates (PubMed:19362538, PubMed:25601083).
