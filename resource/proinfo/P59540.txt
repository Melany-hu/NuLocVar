UniprotID	P59540
Accession	P59540;P59548;Q645X6
EntryName	T2R46_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 46 (T2R46) (Taste receptor type 2 member 54) (T2R54)
GeneName	TAS2R46
Length	309
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5 (By similarity). In airway epithelial cells, binding of bitter compounds increases the intracellular calcium ion concentration and stimulates ciliary beat frequency (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Cell projection; Cilium membrane
