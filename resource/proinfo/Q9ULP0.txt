EntryName	NDRG4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein NDRG4 (Brain development-related molecule 1) (N-myc downstream-regulated gene 4 protein) (Vascular smooth muscle cell-associated protein 8) (SMAP-8)
GeneName	NDRG4 BDM1 KIAA1180
Length	352
Function	Contributes to the maintenance of intracerebral BDNF levels within the normal range, which is necessary for the preservation of spatial learning and the resistance to neuronal cell death caused by ischemic stress (By similarity). May enhance growth factor-induced ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation, including that induced by PDGF and FGF. May attenuate NGF-promoted ELK1 phosphorylation in a microtubule-dependent manner.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol
