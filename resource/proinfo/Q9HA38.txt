UniprotID	Q9HA38
Accession	Q9HA38;B3KVA6;D3DNR1;Q96A21
EntryName	ZMAT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger matrin-type protein 3 (Zinc finger protein WIG-1) (p53-activated gene 608 protein)
GeneName	ZMAT3 PAG608 WIG1
Length	289
Function	Acts as a bona fide target gene of p53/TP53. May play a role in the TP53-dependent growth regulatory pathway. May contribute to TP53-mediated apoptosis by regulation of TP53 expression and translocation to the nucleus and nucleolus.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleus; Nucleolus
