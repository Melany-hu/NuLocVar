UniprotID	Q96ER9
Accession	Q96ER9;Q9HA01
EntryName	MITOK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial potassium channel (MITOK) (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 51)
GeneName	CCDC51 MITOK
Length	411
Function	Pore-forming subunit of the mitochondrial ATP-gated potassium channel (mitoK(ATP)) (PubMed:31435016). Together with ATP-binding subunit ABCB8/MITOSUR of the mitoK(ATP) channel, mediates ATP-dependent K(+) currents across the mitochondrial inner membrane (PubMed:31435016). An increase in ATP intracellular levels closes the channel, inhibiting K(+) transport, whereas a decrease in ATP levels enhances K(+) uptake in the mitochondrial matrix. May contribute to the homeostatic control of cellular metabolism under stress conditions by regulating the mitochondrial matrix volume (PubMed:31435016).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Mitochondrion inner membrane
