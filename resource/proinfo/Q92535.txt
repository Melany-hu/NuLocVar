UniprotID	Q92535
Accession	Q92535;O14491
EntryName	PIGC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit C (Phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class C protein) (PIG-C)
GeneName	PIGC GPI2
Length	297
Function	Part of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex that catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol and participates in the first step of GPI biosynthesis.
