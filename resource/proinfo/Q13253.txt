EntryName	NOGG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Noggin
GeneName	NOG
Length	232
Function	Inhibitor of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) signaling which is required for growth and patterning of the neural tube and somite. Essential for cartilage morphogenesis and joint formation. Inhibits chondrocyte differentiation through its interaction with GDF5 and, probably, GDF6 (PubMed:21976273, PubMed:26643732).
