UniprotID	Q9UHN1
Accession	Q9UHN1;O00419;Q0IJ81;Q96GW2;Q9UK35;Q9UK94
EntryName	DPOG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA polymerase subunit gamma-2 (DNA polymerase gamma accessory 55 kDa subunit) (p55) (Mitochondrial DNA polymerase accessory subunit) (MtPolB) (PolG-beta)
GeneName	POLG2 MTPOLB
Length	485
Function	Accessory subunit of DNA polymerase gamma solely responsible for replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Acts as an allosteric regulator of the holoenzyme activities. Enhances the polymerase activity and the processivity of POLG by increasing its interactions with the DNA template. Suppresses POLG exonucleolytic proofreading especially toward homopolymeric templates bearing mismatched termini. Binds to single-stranded DNA.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion; Mitochondrion matrix; Mitochondrion nucleoid
