UniprotID	A6NGC4
Accession	A6NGC4
EntryName	TLCD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	TLC domain-containing protein 2
GeneName	TLCD2
Length	264
Function	Regulates the composition and fluidity of the plasma membrane (PubMed:30509349). Inhibits the incorporation of membrane-fluidizing phospholipids containing omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) and thereby promotes membrane rigidity (PubMed:30509349). Does not appear to have any effect on LCPUFA synthesis (PubMed:30509349).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
