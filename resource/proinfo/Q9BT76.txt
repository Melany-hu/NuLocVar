EntryName	UPK3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Uroplakin-3b (UP3b) (Uroplakin IIIb) (UPIIIb) (p35)
GeneName	UPK3B
Length	320
Function	Component of the asymmetric unit membrane (AUM); a highly specialized biomembrane elaborated by terminally differentiated urothelial cells. May play an important role in AUM-cytoskeleton interaction in terminally differentiated urothelial cells. It also contributes to the formation of urothelial glycocalyx which may play an important role in preventing bacterial adherence (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
