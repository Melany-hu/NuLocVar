UniprotID	Q8TDC0
Accession	Q8TDC0;B2R9Q4;D3DQG9;Q8IVM1;Q8IVN1
EntryName	MYOZ3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myozenin-3 (Calsarcin-3) (FATZ-related protein 3)
GeneName	MYOZ3 FRP3
Length	251
Function	Myozenins may serve as intracellular binding proteins involved in linking Z line proteins such as alpha-actinin, gamma-filamin, TCAP/telethonin, LDB3/ZASP and localizing calcineurin signaling to the sarcomere. Plays an important role in the modulation of calcineurin signaling. May play a role in myofibrillogenesis.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Myofibril; Sarcomere; Z line
