Length	348
Function	Photoreceptor required for image-forming vision at low light intensity (PubMed:7846071, PubMed:8107847). Required for photoreceptor cell viability after birth (PubMed:12566452, PubMed:2215617). Light-induced isomerization of the chromophore 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal triggers a conformational change that activates signaling via G-proteins (PubMed:26200343, PubMed:28524165, PubMed:28753425, PubMed:8107847). Subsequent receptor phosphorylation mediates displacement of the bound G-protein alpha subunit by the arrestin SAG and terminates signaling (PubMed:26200343, PubMed:28524165).
