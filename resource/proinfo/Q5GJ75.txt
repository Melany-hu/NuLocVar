UniprotID	Q5GJ75
Accession	Q5GJ75;Q6ZWD1
EntryName	TP8L3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 8-like protein 3 (TNF alpha-induced protein 8-like protein 3) (TNFAIP8-like protein 3)
GeneName	TNFAIP8L3 TIPE3
Length	292
Function	Acts as a lipid transfer protein. Preferentially captures and shuttles two lipid second messengers, i.e., phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and increases their levels in the plasma membrane. Additionally, may also function as a lipid-presenting protein to enhance the activity of the PI3K-AKT and MEK-ERK pathways. May act as a regulator of tumorigenesis through its activation of phospholipid signaling.
