UniprotID	Q9BYQ0
Accession	Q9BYQ0
EntryName	KRA98_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 9-8 (Keratin-associated protein 9.8) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 9.8)
GeneName	KRTAP9-8 KAP9.8 KRTAP9.8
Length	159
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
