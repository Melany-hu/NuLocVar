UniprotID	Q9HCN6
Accession	Q9HCN6;Q9HCN7;Q9UIF2
EntryName	GPVI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) (Glycoprotein 6)
GeneName	GP6
Length	339
Function	Collagen receptor involved in collagen-induced platelet adhesion and activation. Plays a key role in platelet procoagulant activity and subsequent thrombin and fibrin formation. This procoagulant function may contribute to arterial and venous thrombus formation. The signaling pathway involves the FcR gamma-chain, the Src kinases (likely FYN or LYN) and SYK, the adapter protein LAT and leads to the activation of PLCG2.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell membrane
