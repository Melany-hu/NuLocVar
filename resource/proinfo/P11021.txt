ProteinName	Endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP (EC 3.6.4.10) (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein) (GRP-78) (Binding-immunoglobulin protein) (BiP) (Heat shock protein 70 family protein 5) (HSP70 family protein 5) (Heat shock protein family A member 5) (Immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein)
GeneName	HSPA5 GRP78
Length	654
Function	Endoplasmic reticulum chaperone that plays a key role in protein folding and quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (PubMed:2294010, PubMed:23769672, PubMed:23990668, PubMed:28332555). Involved in the correct folding of proteins and degradation of misfolded proteins via its interaction with DNAJC10/ERdj5, probably to facilitate the release of DNAJC10/ERdj5 from its substrate (By similarity). Acts as a key repressor of the EIF2AK3/PERK and ERN1/IRE1-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) (PubMed:1550958, PubMed:11907036, PubMed:19538957). In the unstressed endoplasmic reticulum, recruited by DNAJB9/ERdj4 to the luminal region of ERN1/IRE1, leading to disrupt the dimerization of ERN1/IRE1, thereby inactivating ERN1/IRE1 (By similarity). Also binds and inactivates EIF2AK3/PERK in unstressed cells (PubMed:11907036). Accumulation of misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum causes release of HSPA5/BiP from ERN1/IRE1 and EIF2AK3/PERK, allowing their homodimerization and subsequent activation (PubMed:11907036). Plays an auxiliary role in post-translational transport of small presecretory proteins across endoplasmic reticulum (ER). May function as an allosteric modulator for SEC61 channel-forming translocon complex, likely cooperating with SEC62 to enable the productive insertion of these precursors into SEC61 channel. Appears to specifically regulate translocation of precursors having inhibitory residues in their mature region that weaken channel gating. May also play a role in apoptosis and cell proliferation (PubMed:26045166).
