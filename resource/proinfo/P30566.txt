UniprotID	P30566
Accession	P30566;B0QY76;O75495;Q5TI34
EntryName	PUR8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) (ASL) (EC 4.3.2.2) (Adenylosuccinase) (ASase)
GeneName	ADSL AMPS
Length	484
Function	Catalyzes two non-sequential steps in de novo AMP synthesis: converts (S)-2-(5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamido)succinate (SAICAR) to fumarate plus 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide, and thereby also contributes to de novo IMP synthesis, and converts succinyladenosine monophosphate (SAMP) to AMP and fumarate.
