UniprotID	Q9H813
Accession	Q9H813;B7Z4D6;Q6IA87;Q9NV85
EntryName	PACC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proton-activated chloride channel (PAC) (hPAC) (Acid-sensitive outwardly-rectifying anion channel) (ASOR) (Proton-activated outwardly rectifying anion channel) (PAORAC) (Transmembrane protein 206) (hTMEM206)
GeneName	PACC1 C1orf75 TMEM206
Length	350
Function	Chloride channel gated by pH that facilitates the entry of chloride ions into cells upon exposure to extracellular acidic pH (PubMed:31023925, PubMed:31318332). Involved in acidosis-induced cell death by mediating chloride influx and subsequent cell swelling (PubMed:31023925, PubMed:31318332).
