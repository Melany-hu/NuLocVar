UniprotID	Q15319
Accession	Q15319;O60557;Q2M3F8
EntryName	PO4F3_HUMAN
ProteinName	POU domain, class 4, transcription factor 3 (Brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein 3C) (Brain-3C) (Brn-3C)
GeneName	POU4F3 BRN3C
Length	338
Function	Acts as a transcriptional activator (PubMed:18228599). Acts by binding to sequences related to the consensus octamer motif 5'-ATGCAAAT-3' in the regulatory regions of its target genes (PubMed:18228599). Involved in the auditory system development, required for terminal differentiation of hair cells in the inner ear (By similarity).
