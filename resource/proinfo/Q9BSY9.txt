UniprotID	Q9BSY9
Accession	Q9BSY9;B1APK6;Q5VVC6;Q9NYS2;Q9Y3E4
EntryName	DESI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deubiquitinase DESI2 (EC 3.4.19.12) (Desumoylating isopeptidase 2) (DeSI-2) (PPPDE peptidase domain-containing protein 1) (Palmitoyl protein thioesterase DESI2) (EC 3.1.2.22) (Protein FAM152A) (S-depalmitoylase DESI2)
GeneName	DESI2 C1orf121 FAM152A PPPDE1 CGI-146 PNAS-4
Length	194
Function	Has deubiquitinating activity towards 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains. Deubiquitinates 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination of RPS7 leading to its stabilization (PubMed:28483520). Exhibits palmitoyl protein thioesterase (S-depalmitoylation) activity towards synthetic substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-S-palmitoyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and S-depalmitoylation probe 5 (DPP-5) (PubMed:35427157).
