EntryName	CXCR4_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXC-R4) (CXCR-4) (FB22) (Fusin) (HM89) (LCR1) (Leukocyte-derived seven transmembrane domain receptor) (LESTR) (Lipopolysaccharide-associated protein 3) (LAP-3) (LPS-associated protein 3) (NPYRL) (Stromal cell-derived factor 1 receptor) (SDF-1 receptor) (CD antigen CD184)
GeneName	CXCR4
Length	352
Function	Receptor for the C-X-C chemokine CXCL12/SDF-1 that transduces a signal by increasing intracellular calcium ion levels and enhancing MAPK1/MAPK3 activation (PubMed:10452968, PubMed:18799424, PubMed:24912431, PubMed:28978524). Involved in the AKT signaling cascade (PubMed:24912431). Plays a role in regulation of cell migration, e.g. during wound healing (PubMed:28978524). Acts as a receptor for extracellular ubiquitin; leading to enhanced intracellular calcium ions and reduced cellular cAMP levels (PubMed:20228059). Binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) et mediates LPS-induced inflammatory response, including TNF secretion by monocytes (PubMed:11276205). Involved in hematopoiesis and in cardiac ventricular septum formation. Also plays an essential role in vascularization of the gastrointestinal tract, probably by regulating vascular branching and/or remodeling processes in endothelial cells. Involved in cerebellar development. In the CNS, could mediate hippocampal-neuron survival (By similarity).
