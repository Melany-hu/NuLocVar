UniprotID	Q8N8Y2
Accession	Q8N8Y2
EntryName	VA0D2_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit d 2 (V-ATPase subunit d 2) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit d 2)
GeneName	ATP6V0D2
Length	350
Function	Subunit of the V0 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons. V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment (By similarity). May play a role in coupling of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis (By similarity). Regulator of osteoclast fusion and bone formation (By similarity).
