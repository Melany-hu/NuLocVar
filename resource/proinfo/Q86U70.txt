UniprotID	Q86U70
Accession	Q86U70;B4DUC4;O75479;O96010;Q1EQX1;Q9UGM4
EntryName	LDB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	LIM domain-binding protein 1 (LDB-1) (Carboxyl-terminal LIM domain-binding protein 2) (CLIM-2) (LIM domain-binding factor CLIM2) (hLdb1) (Nuclear LIM interactor)
GeneName	LDB1 CLIM2
Length	411
Function	Binds to the LIM domain of a wide variety of LIM domain-containing transcription factors. May regulate the transcriptional activity of LIM-containing proteins by determining specific partner interactions. Plays a role in the development of interneurons and motor neurons in cooperation with LHX3 and ISL1. Acts synergistically with LHX1/LIM1 in axis formation and activation of gene expression. Acts with LMO2 in the regulation of red blood cell development, maintaining erythroid precursors in an immature state.
