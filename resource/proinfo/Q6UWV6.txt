EntryName	ENPP7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 7 (E-NPP 7) (NPP-7) (EC 3.1.4.12) (Alkaline sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase) (Intestinal alkaline sphingomyelinase) (Alk-SMase)
GeneName	ENPP7 UNQ3077/PRO9912
Length	458
Function	Choline-specific phosphodiesterase that hydrolyzes sphingomyelin releasing the ceramide and phosphocholine and therefore is involved in sphingomyelin digestion, ceramide formation, and fatty acid (FA) absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (PubMed:12671034, PubMed:12885774, PubMed:15205117, PubMed:16255717, PubMed:28292932). Also has phospholipase C activity and can also cleave phosphocholine from palmitoyl lyso-phosphatidylcholine and platelet-activating factor (PAF) leading to its inactivation (PubMed:12885774, PubMed:16255717). Does not have nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity (PubMed:12885774). May promote cholesterol absorption by affecting the levels of sphingomyelin derived from either diet or endogenous sources, in the intestinal lumen (By similarity).
