UniprotID	P08571
Accession	P08571;Q53XT5;Q96FR6;Q96L99;Q9UNS3
EntryName	CD14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Monocyte differentiation antigen CD14 (My23 antigen) (Myeloid cell-specific leucine-rich glycoprotein) (CD antigen CD14) [Cleaved into: Monocyte differentiation antigen CD14, urinary form; Monocyte differentiation antigen CD14, membrane-bound form]
GeneName	CD14
Length	375
Function	Coreceptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (PubMed:1698311, PubMed:23264655). In concert with LBP, binds to monomeric lipopolysaccharide and delivers it to the LY96/TLR4 complex, thereby mediating the innate immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (PubMed:20133493, PubMed:22265692, PubMed:23264655). Acts via MyD88, TIRAP and TRAF6, leading to NF-kappa-B activation, cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response (PubMed:8612135). Acts as a coreceptor for TLR2:TLR6 heterodimer in response to diacylated lipopeptides and for TLR2:TLR1 heterodimer in response to triacylated lipopeptides, these clusters trigger signaling from the cell surface and subsequently are targeted to the Golgi in a lipid-raft dependent pathway (PubMed:16880211). Binds electronegative LDL (LDL(-)) and mediates the cytokine release induced by LDL(-) (PubMed:23880187).
