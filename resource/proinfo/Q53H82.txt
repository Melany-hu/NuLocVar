UniprotID	Q53H82
Accession	Q53H82;A8K2D6;Q9Y392
EntryName	LACB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endoribonuclease LACTB2 (EC 3.1.27.-) (Beta-lactamase-like protein 2)
GeneName	LACTB2 CGI-83
Length	288
Function	Endoribonuclease; cleaves preferentially 3' to purine-pyrimidine dinucleotide motifs in single-stranded RNA. The cleavage product contains a free 3' -OH group. Has no activity with double-stranded RNA or DNA. Required for normal mitochondrial function and cell viability.
