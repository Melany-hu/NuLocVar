Function	Involved in several stages of intracellular trafficking. Interacts with membranes containing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3P)) or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) (PubMed:12198132). Acts in part as component of the retromer membrane-deforming SNX-BAR subcomplex. The SNX-BAR retromer mediates retrograde transport of cargo proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is involved in endosome-to-plasma membrane transport for cargo protein recycling. The SNX-BAR subcomplex functions to deform the donor membrane into a tubular profile called endosome-to-TGN transport carrier (ETC) (Probable). Can sense membrane curvature and has in vitro vesicle-to-membrane remodeling activity (PubMed:19816406, PubMed:23085988). Involved in retrograde endosome-to-TGN transport of lysosomal enzyme receptors (IGF2R, M6PR and SORT1) and Shiginella dysenteria toxin stxB. Plays a role in targeting ligand-activated EGFR to the lysosomes for degradation after endocytosis from the cell surface and release from the Golgi (PubMed:12198132, PubMed:15498486, PubMed:17101778, PubMed:17550970, PubMed:18088323, PubMed:21040701). Involvement in retromer-independent endocytic trafficking of P2RY1 and lysosomal degradation of protease-activated receptor-1/F2R (PubMed:16407403, PubMed:20070609). Promotes KALRN- and RHOG-dependent but retromer-independent membrane remodeling such as lamellipodium formation; the function is dependent on GEF activity of KALRN (PubMed:20604901). Required for endocytosis of DRD5 upon agonist stimulation but not for basal receptor trafficking (PubMed:23152498).
