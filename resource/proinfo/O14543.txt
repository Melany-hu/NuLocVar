UniprotID	O14543
Accession	O14543;O14509
EntryName	SOCS3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3) (Cytokine-inducible SH2 protein 3) (CIS-3) (STAT-induced STAT inhibitor 3) (SSI-3)
GeneName	SOCS3 CIS3 SSI3
Length	225
Function	SOCS family proteins form part of a classical negative feedback system that regulates cytokine signal transduction. SOCS3 is involved in negative regulation of cytokines that signal through the JAK/STAT pathway. Inhibits cytokine signal transduction by binding to tyrosine kinase receptors including IL6ST/gp130, LIF, erythropoietin, insulin, IL12, GCSF and leptin receptors. Binding to JAK2 inhibits its kinase activity and regulates IL6 signaling. Suppresses fetal liver erythropoiesis. Regulates onset and maintenance of allergic responses mediated by T-helper type 2 cells (By similarity). Probable substrate recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin BC-CUL2/5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:15601820).
