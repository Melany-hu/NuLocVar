UniprotID	O43716
Accession	O43716;B3KSU7;Q3B824;Q3KNR8
EntryName	GATC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit C, mitochondrial (Glu-AdT subunit C) (EC 6.3.5.-) (Protein 15E1.2)
GeneName	GATC 15E1.2
Length	136
Function	Allows the formation of correctly charged Gln-tRNA(Gln) through the transamidation of misacylated Glu-tRNA(Gln) in the mitochondria. The reaction takes place in the presence of glutamine and ATP through an activated gamma-phospho-Glu-tRNA(Gln).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
