UniprotID	Q14442
Accession	Q14442;B2RAA4
EntryName	PIGH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit H (Phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class H protein) (PIG-H)
GeneName	PIGH
Length	188
Function	Part of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex that catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol and participates in the first step of GPI biosynthesis.
