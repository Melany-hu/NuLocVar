UniprotID	Q9Y3C7
Accession	Q9Y3C7;B2R4L9
EntryName	MED31_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 31 (Mediator complex subunit 31) (Mediator complex subunit SOH1) (hSOH1)
GeneName	MED31 SOH1 CGI-125
Length	131
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
