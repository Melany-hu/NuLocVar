UniprotID	P07947
Accession	P07947;A6NLB3;D3DUH1
EntryName	YES_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tyrosine-protein kinase Yes (EC 2.7.10.2) (Proto-oncogene c-Yes) (p61-Yes)
GeneName	YES1 YES
Length	543
Function	Non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival, apoptosis, cell-cell adhesion, cytoskeleton remodeling, and differentiation. Stimulation by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including EGFR, PDGFR, CSF1R and FGFR leads to recruitment of YES1 to the phosphorylated receptor, and activation and phosphorylation of downstream substrates. Upon EGFR activation, promotes the phosphorylation of PARD3 to favor epithelial tight junction assembly. Participates in the phosphorylation of specific junctional components such as CTNND1 by stimulating the FYN and FER tyrosine kinases at cell-cell contacts. Upon T-cell stimulation by CXCL12, phosphorylates collapsin response mediator protein 2/DPYSL2 and induces T-cell migration. Participates in CD95L/FASLG signaling pathway and mediates AKT-mediated cell migration. Plays a role in cell cycle progression by phosphorylating the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/CDK4 thus regulating the G1 phase. Also involved in G2/M progression and cytokinesis. Catalyzes phosphorylation of organic cation transporter OCT2 which induces its transport activity (PubMed:26979622).
