UniprotID	Q15306
Accession	Q15306;Q5VUI7;Q99660
EntryName	IRF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF-4) (Lymphocyte-specific interferon regulatory factor) (LSIRF) (Multiple myeloma oncogene 1) (NF-EM5)
GeneName	IRF4 MUM1
Length	451
Function	Transcriptional activator. Binds to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) of the MHC class I promoter. Binds the immunoglobulin lambda light chain enhancer, together with PU.1. Probably plays a role in ISRE-targeted signal transduction mechanisms specific to lymphoid cells. Involved in CD8(+) dendritic cell differentiation by forming a complex with the BATF-JUNB heterodimer in immune cells, leading to recognition of AICE sequence (5'-TGAnTCA/GAAA-3'), an immune-specific regulatory element, followed by cooperative binding of BATF and IRF4 and activation of genes (By similarity).
