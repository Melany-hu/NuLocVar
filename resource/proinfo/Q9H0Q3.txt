UniprotID	Q9H0Q3
Accession	Q9H0Q3;A8K0R4;J3QLD2;Q6FIG9;Q6UW52
EntryName	FXYD6_HUMAN
ProteinName	FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 6 (Phosphohippolin)
GeneName	FXYD6 UNQ521/PRO1056
Length	95
Function	Associates with and regulates the activity of the sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase (NKA) which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of Na(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane. Reduces the apparent affinity for intracellular Na(+) with no change in the apparent affinity for extracellular K(+) (PubMed:33231612). In addition to modulating NKA kinetics, may also function as a regulator of NKA localization to the plasma membrane (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
