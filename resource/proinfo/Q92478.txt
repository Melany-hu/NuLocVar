UniprotID	Q92478
Accession	Q92478;B2R9U1;Q8IZE9;Q9BS74;Q9UQB4
EntryName	CLC2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-type lectin domain family 2 member B (Activation-induced C-type lectin) (C-type lectin superfamily member 2) (IFN-alpha-2b-inducing-related protein 1)
GeneName	CLEC2B AICL CLECSF2 IFNRG1
Length	149
Function	Membrane-bound protein expressed on myeloid cells which acts as a ligand to stimulate the activating receptor NKp80/KLRF1, expressed on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells. In turn, stimulates NK-cell cytotoxicity and cytokine production leading to the cytolysis of malignant CLEC2B-expressing myeloid cells.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane
