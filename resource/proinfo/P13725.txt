UniprotID	P13725
Accession	P13725;Q6FHP8;Q9UCP6
EntryName	ONCM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Oncostatin-M (OSM)
GeneName	OSM
Length	252
Function	Growth regulator. Inhibits the proliferation of a number of tumor cell lines. Stimulates proliferation of AIDS-KS cells. It regulates cytokine production, including IL-6, G-CSF and GM-CSF from endothelial cells. Uses both type I OSM receptor (heterodimers composed of LIFR and IL6ST) and type II OSM receptor (heterodimers composed of OSMR and IL6ST). Involved in the maturation of fetal hepatocytes, thereby promoting liver development and regeneration (By similarity).
