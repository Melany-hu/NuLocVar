UniprotID	P46695
Accession	P46695;Q5SU30;Q92691;Q93044
EntryName	IEX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Radiation-inducible immediate-early gene IEX-1 (Differentiation-dependent gene 2 protein) (Protein DIF-2) (Immediate early protein GLY96) (Immediate early response 3 protein) (PACAP-responsive gene 1 protein) (Protein PRG1)
GeneName	IER3 DIF2 IEX1 PRG1
Length	156
Function	May play a role in the ERK signaling pathway by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of ERK by phosphatase PP2A-PPP2R5C holoenzyme. Also acts as an ERK downstream effector mediating survival. As a member of the NUPR1/RELB/IER3 survival pathway, may provide pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with remarkable resistance to cell stress, such as starvation or gemcitabine treatment.
