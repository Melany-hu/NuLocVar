UniprotID	P12271
Accession	P12271;B2R667
EntryName	RLBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinaldehyde-binding protein 1 (Cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein)
GeneName	RLBP1 CRALBP
Length	317
Function	Soluble retinoid carrier essential the proper function of both rod and cone photoreceptors. Participates in the regeneration of active 11-cis-retinol and 11-cis-retinaldehyde, from the inactive 11-trans products of the rhodopsin photocycle and in the de novo synthesis of these retinoids from 11-trans metabolic precursors. The cycling of retinoids between photoreceptor and adjacent pigment epithelium cells is known as the 'visual cycle'.
