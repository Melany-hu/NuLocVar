UniprotID	P30793
Accession	P30793;Q6FHY7;Q9Y4I8
EntryName	GCH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (EC 3.5.4.16) (GTP cyclohydrolase I) (GTP-CH-I)
GeneName	GCH1 DYT5 GCH
Length	250
Function	Positively regulates nitric oxide synthesis in umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). May be involved in dopamine synthesis. May modify pain sensitivity and persistence. Isoform GCH-1 is the functional enzyme, the potential function of the enzymatically inactive isoforms remains unknown.
