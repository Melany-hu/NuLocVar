UniprotID	Q70EL3
Accession	Q70EL3;E9PP86
EntryName	UBP50_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 50 (EC 3.4.19.12) (Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 50)
GeneName	USP50
Length	339
Function	Deubiquitinating enzyme that removes conjugated ubiquitin from specific proteins to regulate different cellular processes. Regulates the inflammasome signaling pathway by deubiquitinating 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of the PYCARD/ASC adapter protein (PubMed:28094437). Regulates the ubiquitination and stability of the ACE2 protein (PubMed:36876523). Acts as a negative regulator of the G2/M checkpoint pathway, by preventing serine/threonine kinase WEE1 degradation, thereby repressing entry into mitosis following activation of the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint (PubMed:20930503).
