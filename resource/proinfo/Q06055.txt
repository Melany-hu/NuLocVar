UniprotID	Q06055
Accession	Q06055;B3KQQ6
EntryName	AT5G2_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP synthase F(0) complex subunit C2, mitochondrial (ATP synthase lipid-binding protein) (ATP synthase membrane subunit c locus 2) (ATP synthase proteolipid P2) (ATP synthase proton-transporting mitochondrial F(0) complex subunit C2) (ATPase protein 9) (ATPase subunit c)
GeneName	ATP5MC2 ATP5G2 PSEC0033
Length	141
Function	Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. Part of the complex F(0) domain. A homomeric c-ring of probably 10 subunits is part of the complex rotary element.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion membrane
