EntryName	TRADD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated DEATH domain protein (TNFR1-associated DEATH domain protein) (TNFRSF1A-associated via death domain)
GeneName	TRADD
Length	312
Function	Adapter molecule for TNFRSF1A/TNFR1 that specifically associates with the cytoplasmic domain of activated TNFRSF1A/TNFR1 mediating its interaction with FADD (PubMed:23955153, PubMed:7758105, PubMed:8612133). Overexpression of TRADD leads to two major TNF-induced responses, apoptosis and activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:7758105, PubMed:8612133). The nuclear form acts as a tumor suppressor by preventing ubiquitination and degradation of isoform p19ARF/ARF of CDKN2A by TRIP12: acts by interacting with TRIP12, leading to disrupt interaction between TRIP12 and isoform p19ARF/ARF of CDKN2A (By similarity).
