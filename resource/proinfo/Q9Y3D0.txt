UniprotID	Q9Y3D0
Accession	Q9Y3D0
EntryName	CIA2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytosolic iron-sulfur assembly component 2B (MSS19-interacting protein of 18 kDa) (Mitotic spindle-associated MMXD complex subunit MIP18) (Protein FAM96B)
GeneName	CIAO2B CIAB FAM96B MIP18 CGI-128 HSPC118
Length	163
Function	Component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates the incorporation of iron-sulfur cluster into extramitochondrial Fe/S proteins (PubMed:22678361, PubMed:22678362, PubMed:23891004, PubMed:29848660). As a CIA complex component and in collaboration with CIAO1 and MMS19, binds to and facilitates the assembly of most cytosolic-nuclear Fe/S proteins (PubMed:23891004, PubMed:29848660). As part of the mitotic spindle-associated MMXD complex it plays a role in chromosome segregation, probably by facilitating iron-sulfur cluster assembly into ERCC2/XPD (PubMed:20797633). Together with MMS19, facilitates the transfer of Fe-S clusters to the motor protein KIF4A, which ensures proper localization of KIF4A to mitotic machinery components to promote the progression of mitosis (PubMed:29848660).
