UniprotID	P46093
Accession	P46093;A8K3T3;B0M0K1;Q6NWM4
EntryName	GPR4_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 4 (G-protein coupled receptor 6C.l) (GPR6C.l)
GeneName	GPR4
Length	362
Function	Proton-sensing G-protein coupled receptor couples to multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including GNAS/cAMP, GNAQ/phospholipase C (PLC), and GNA12/GNA13/Rho pathways (PubMed:12955148, PubMed:17462861, PubMed:20211729, PubMed:22110680). Acidosis-induced GPR4 activation increases paracellular gap formation and permeability of vascular endothelial cells through the GNA12/GNA13/Rho GTPase signaling pathway (PubMed:32058960). In the brain may mediate central respiratory sensitivity to CO(2)H(+) (By similarity).
