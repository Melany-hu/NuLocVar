UniprotID	Q8N4Q0
Accession	Q8N4Q0;A8KA15;B4DZ91
EntryName	PTGR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostaglandin reductase 3 (PRG-3) (EC 1.3.1.48) (Zinc-binding alcohol dehydrogenase domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	PTGR3 ZADH2
Length	377
Function	Functions as 15-oxo-prostaglandin 13-reductase and acts on 15-keto-PGE1, 15-keto-PGE2, 15-keto-PGE1-alpha and 15-keto-PGE2-alpha with highest efficiency towards 15-keto-PGE2-alpha. Overexpression represses transcriptional activity of PPARG and inhibits adipocyte differentiation.
Subcellular Location	Peroxisome
