UniprotID	P09430
Accession	P09430
EntryName	STP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Spermatid nuclear transition protein 1 (STP-1) (TP-1)
GeneName	TNP1
Length	55
Function	Plays a key role in the replacement of histones to protamine in the elongating spermatids of mammals. In condensing spermatids, loaded onto the nucleosomes, where it promotes the recruitment and processing of protamines, which are responsible for histone eviction.
