UniprotID	Q9NPC1
Accession	Q9NPC1;Q5KU28;Q9NPE5
EntryName	LT4R2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leukotriene B4 receptor 2 (LTB4-R 2) (LTB4-R2) (LTB4 receptor JULF2) (Leukotriene B4 receptor BLT2) (Seven transmembrane receptor BLTR2)
GeneName	LTB4R2 BLT2R BLTR2
Length	358
Function	Low-affinity receptor for leukotrienes including leukotriene B4. Mediates chemotaxis of granulocytes and macrophages. The response is mediated via G-proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. The rank order of affinities for the leukotrienes is LTB4 > 12-epi-LTB4 > LTB5 > LTB3.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
