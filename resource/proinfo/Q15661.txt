EntryName	TRYB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tryptase alpha/beta-1 (Tryptase-1) (EC 3.4.21.59) (Tryptase I) (Tryptase alpha-1)
GeneName	TPSAB1 TPS1 TPS2 TPSB1
Length	275
Function	Tryptase is the major neutral protease present in mast cells and is secreted upon the coupled activation-degranulation response of this cell type. May play a role in innate immunity. Isoform 2 cleaves large substrates, such as fibronectin, more efficiently than isoform 1, but seems less efficient toward small substrates (PubMed:18854315).
