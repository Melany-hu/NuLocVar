UniprotID	P19883
Accession	P19883;B5BU94;Q9BTH0
EntryName	FST_HUMAN
ProteinName	Follistatin (FS) (Activin-binding protein)
GeneName	FST
Length	344
Function	Multifunctional regulatory protein whose primary function is to antagonize members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) superfamily including activin, myostatin, GDF11 or bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (PubMed:11279126, PubMed:16482217, PubMed:18535106). Mechanistically, binds to these ligands in the extracellular space, blocking their type II receptor-binding site to inhibit downstream signaling (PubMed:16482217). Plays an essential role in muscle fiber formation and growth both by preventing the repressive effects of myostatin and through SMAD3/AKT/mTOR signaling independently of myostatin (By similarity). Also promotes neural differentiation by antagonizing the action BMP4 (By similarity). Acts as a specific inhibitor of the biosynthesis and secretion of pituitary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) by sequestering activin A/INHBA (PubMed:11279126). On the other hand, translocates into the nucleus where it down-regulates rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis to maintain cellular energy homeostasis by binding to rDNA.
