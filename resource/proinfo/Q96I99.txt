UniprotID	Q96I99
Accession	Q96I99;C9JVT2;O95195;Q6NUH7;Q86VX8;Q8WUQ1
EntryName	SUCB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Succinate--CoA ligase [GDP-forming] subunit beta, mitochondrial (EC 6.2.1.4) (GTP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetase subunit beta) (G-SCS) (GTPSCS) (Succinyl-CoA synthetase beta-G chain) (SCS-betaG)
GeneName	SUCLG2
Length	432
Function	GTP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetase functions in the citric acid cycle (TCA), coupling the hydrolysis of succinyl-CoA to the synthesis of GTP and thus represents the only step of substrate-level phosphorylation in the TCA. The beta subunit provides nucleotide specificity of the enzyme and binds the substrate succinate, while the binding sites for coenzyme A and phosphate are found in the alpha subunit.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
