UniprotID	Q86WA6
Accession	Q86WA6;Q00306;Q13855;Q3KP51
EntryName	BPHL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Valacyclovir hydrolase (VACVase) (Valacyclovirase) (EC 3.1.-.-) (Biphenyl hydrolase-like protein) (Biphenyl hydrolase-related protein) (Bph-rp) (Breast epithelial mucin-associated antigen) (MCNAA)
GeneName	BPHL MCNAA
Length	291
Function	Serine hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolytic activation of amino acid ester prodrugs of nucleoside analogs such as valacyclovir and valganciclovir. Activates valacyclovir to acyclovir. May play a role in detoxification processes. It is a specific alpha-amino acid ester hydrolase that prefers small, hydrophobic, and aromatic side chains and does not have a stringent requirement for the leaving group other than preferring a primary alcohol.
