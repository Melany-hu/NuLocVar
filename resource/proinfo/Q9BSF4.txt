UniprotID	Q9BSF4
Accession	Q9BSF4;Q96EY6;Q96IT8
EntryName	TIM29_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim29 (TIM29)
GeneName	TIMM29 c19orf52
Length	260
Function	Component of the TIM22 complex, a complex that mediates the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. The TIM22 complex forms a twin-pore translocase that uses the membrane potential as the external driving force. Required for the stability of the TIM22 complex and functions in the assembly of the TIMM22 protein into the TIM22 complex. May facilitate cooperation between TIM22 and TOM complexes by interacting with TOMM40.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
