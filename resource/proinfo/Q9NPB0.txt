UniprotID	Q9NPB0
Accession	Q9NPB0;Q9H0D8
EntryName	SAYS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	SAYSvFN domain-containing protein 1
GeneName	SAYSD1 C6orf64
Length	183
Function	Ufmylation 'reader' component of a translocation-associated quality control pathway, a mechanism that takes place when a ribosome has stalled during translation, and which is required to degrade clogged substrates (PubMed:36848233). Specifically recognizes and binds ufmylated ribosomes when a ribosome has stalled, promoting the transport of stalled nascent chain via the TRAPP complex to lysosomes for degradation (PubMed:36848233).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane
