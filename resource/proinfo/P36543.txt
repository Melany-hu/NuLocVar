UniprotID	P36543
Accession	P36543;A8MUE4;A8MUN4
EntryName	VATE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit E 1 (V-ATPase subunit E 1) (V-ATPase 31 kDa subunit) (p31) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit E 1)
GeneName	ATP6V1E1 ATP6E ATP6E2
Length	226
Function	Subunit of the V1 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons (PubMed:32001091, PubMed:33065002). V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment (PubMed:32001091).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane
