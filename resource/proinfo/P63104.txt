EntryName	1433Z_HUMAN
ProteinName	14-3-3 protein zeta/delta (Protein kinase C inhibitor protein 1) (KCIP-1)
GeneName	YWHAZ
Length	245
Function	Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathways (PubMed:14578935, PubMed:15071501, PubMed:15644438, PubMed:16376338, PubMed:16959763, PubMed:31024343, PubMed:9360956). Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif (PubMed:35662396). Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner (PubMed:35662396). Promotes cytosolic retention and inactivation of TFEB transcription factor by binding to phosphorylated TFEB (PubMed:35662396). Induces ARHGEF7 activity on RAC1 as well as lamellipodia and membrane ruffle formation (PubMed:16959763). In neurons, regulates spine maturation through the modulation of ARHGEF7 activity (By similarity).
