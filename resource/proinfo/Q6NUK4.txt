UniprotID	Q6NUK4
Accession	Q6NUK4;Q5JQR5;Q5QGT2;Q6PEW8;Q6PJY4
EntryName	REEP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Receptor expression-enhancing protein 3
GeneName	REEP3 C10orf74
Length	255
Function	Microtubule-binding protein required to ensure proper cell division and nuclear envelope reassembly by sequestering the endoplasmic reticulum away from chromosomes during mitosis. Probably acts by clearing the endoplasmic reticulum membrane from metaphase chromosomes.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
