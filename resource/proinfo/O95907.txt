UniprotID	O95907
Accession	O95907;Q9UBE2
EntryName	MOT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Monocarboxylate transporter 3 (MCT 3) (Solute carrier family 16 member 8)
GeneName	SLC16A8 MCT3
Length	504
Function	Probable retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-specific proton-coupled L-lactate transporter (By similarity). May facilitate transport of lactate and H(+) out of the retina and could therefore play a role in pH and ion homeostasis of the outer retina (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Basolateral cell membrane
