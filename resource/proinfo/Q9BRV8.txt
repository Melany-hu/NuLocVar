UniprotID	Q9BRV8
Accession	Q9BRV8;Q5TEZ7;Q5TEZ9;Q68DZ4;Q9H778
EntryName	SIKE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Suppressor of IKBKE 1 (Suppressor of IKK-epsilon)
GeneName	SIKE1 SIKE
Length	207
Function	Physiological suppressor of IKK-epsilon and TBK1 that plays an inhibitory role in virus- and TLR3-triggered IRF3. Inhibits TLR3-mediated activation of interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) and the IFN-beta promoter. May act by disrupting the interactions of IKBKE or TBK1 with TICAM1/TRIF, IRF3 and RIGI. Does not inhibit NF-kappa-B activation pathways (PubMed:16281057). Associates with the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) core complex, forming the extended (SIKE1:SLMAP)STRIPAK complex (PubMed:30622739). The (SIKE1:SLMAP)STRIPAK complex dephosphorylates STK3 leading to the inhibition of Hippo signaling and the control of cell growth (PubMed:30622739).
