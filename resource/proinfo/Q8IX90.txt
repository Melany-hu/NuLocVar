EntryName	SKA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Spindle and kinetochore-associated protein 3
GeneName	SKA3 C13orf3 RAMA1
Length	412
Function	Component of the SKA1 complex, a microtubule-binding subcomplex of the outer kinetochore that is essential for proper chromosome segregation (PubMed:19289083, PubMed:19360002, PubMed:23085020). The SKA1 complex is a direct component of the kinetochore-microtubule interface and directly associates with microtubules as oligomeric assemblies (PubMed:19289083, PubMed:19360002). The complex facilitates the processive movement of microspheres along a microtubule in a depolymerization-coupled manner (PubMed:19289083). In the complex, it mediates the microtubule-stimulated oligomerization (PubMed:19289083). Affinity for microtubules is synergistically enhanced in the presence of the ndc-80 complex and may allow the ndc-80 complex to track depolymerizing microtubules (PubMed:23085020).
