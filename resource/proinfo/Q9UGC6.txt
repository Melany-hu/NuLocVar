UniprotID	Q9UGC6
Accession	Q9UGC6;Q5TF49;Q8TD61;Q9UJS8
EntryName	RGS17_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 17 (RGS17)
GeneName	RGS17 RGSZ2
Length	210
Function	Regulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades, including signaling via muscarinic acetylcholine receptor CHRM2 and dopamine receptor DRD2. Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits, thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form (PubMed:15096504). Binds selectively to GNAZ and GNAI2 subunits, accelerates their GTPase activity and regulates their signaling activities. Negatively regulates mu-opioid receptor-mediated activation of the G-proteins (By similarity).
