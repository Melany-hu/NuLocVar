EntryName	IRF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3)
GeneName	IRF3
Length	427
Function	Key transcriptional regulator of type I interferon (IFN)-dependent immune responses which plays a critical role in the innate immune response against DNA and RNA viruses (PubMed:22394562, PubMed:24049179, PubMed:25636800, PubMed:27302953, PubMed:31340999, PubMed:36603579, PubMed:8524823). Regulates the transcription of type I IFN genes (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISG) by binding to an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) in their promoters (PubMed:11846977, PubMed:16846591, PubMed:16979567, PubMed:20049431, PubMed:32972995, PubMed:36603579, PubMed:8524823). Acts as a more potent activator of the IFN-beta (IFNB) gene than the IFN-alpha (IFNA) gene and plays a critical role in both the early and late phases of the IFNA/B gene induction (PubMed:16846591, PubMed:16979567, PubMed:20049431, PubMed:36603579). Found in an inactive form in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells and following viral infection, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), or toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, is phosphorylated by IKBKE and TBK1 kinases (PubMed:22394562, PubMed:25636800, PubMed:27302953, PubMed:36603579). This induces a conformational change, leading to its dimerization and nuclear localization and association with CREB binding protein (CREBBP) to form dsRNA-activated factor 1 (DRAF1), a complex which activates the transcription of the type I IFN and ISG genes (PubMed:16154084, PubMed:27302953, PubMed:33440148, PubMed:36603579). Can activate distinct gene expression programs in macrophages and can induce significant apoptosis in primary macrophages (PubMed:16846591). In response to Sendai virus infection, is recruited by TOMM70:HSP90AA1 to mitochondrion and forms an apoptosis complex TOMM70:HSP90AA1:IRF3:BAX inducing apoptosis (PubMed:25609812). Key transcription factor regulating the IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection (PubMed:33440148).
