UniprotID	Q7Z7H5
Accession	Q7Z7H5;A4D2K8;B4DFJ4;Q56VW3;Q7Z432;Q8N2P6
EntryName	TMED4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 4 (Endoplasmic reticulum stress-response protein 25) (ERS25) (GMP25iso) (Putative NF-kappa-B-activating protein 156) (p24 family protein alpha-3) (p24alpha3)
GeneName	TMED4 ERS25
Length	227
Function	Involved in vesicular protein trafficking, mainly in the early secretory pathway. targeting. Involved in the maintenance of the Golgi apparatus. Appears to play a role in the biosynthesis of secreted cargo including processing. Involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress response. May play a role in the regulation of heat-shock response and apoptosis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
