UniprotID	P61758
Accession	P61758;B2R8L5;B4DWR3;F5H2A7;O55228;Q15765;Q5JT81;Q86X96
EntryName	PFD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prefoldin subunit 3 (HIBBJ46) (von Hippel-Lindau-binding protein 1) (VBP-1) (VHL-binding protein 1)
GeneName	VBP1 PFDN3
Length	197
Function	Binds specifically to cytosolic chaperonin (c-CPN) and transfers target proteins to it. Binds to nascent polypeptide chain and promotes folding in an environment in which there are many competing pathways for nonnative proteins.
