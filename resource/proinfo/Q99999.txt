EntryName	G3ST1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Galactosylceramide sulfotransferase (GalCer sulfotransferase) (EC 2.8.2.11) (3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate:GalCer sulfotransferase) (3'-phosphoadenylylsulfate:galactosylceramide 3'-sulfotransferase) (Cerebroside sulfotransferase)
GeneName	GAL3ST1 CST
Length	423
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of a sulfate group to position 3 of non-reducing beta-galactosyl residues in glycerolipids and sphingolipids, therefore participates in the biosynthesis of sulfoglycolipids (PubMed:8830034, PubMed:9030544). Catalyzes the synthesis of galactosylceramide sulfate (sulfatide), a major lipid component of the myelin sheath and of monogalactosylalkylacylglycerol sulfate (seminolipid), present in spermatocytes (PubMed:8830034). Seems to prefer beta-glycosides at the non-reducing termini of sugar chains attached to a lipid moiety (PubMed:8830034). Also acts on lactosylceramide, galactosyl 1-alkyl-2-sn-glycerol and galactosyl diacylglycerol (in vitro) (PubMed:8830034).
