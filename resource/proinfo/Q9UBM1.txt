Accession	Q9UBM1;A8MZ66;B4DY41;D3DXC3;Q6IAQ5;Q86VL3;Q9BW86;Q9UHY6;Q9Y6V9
EntryName	PEMT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEAMT) (PEMT) (EC 2.1.1.17) (EC 2.1.1.71) (PEMT2) (Phospholipid methyltransferase) (PLMT)
GeneName	PEMT PEMPT PNMT
Length	199
Function	Catalyzes the three sequential steps of the methylation pathway for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a critical and essential component for membrane structure (PubMed:12431977, PubMed:15927961). Uses S-adenosylmethionine (S-adenosyl-L-methionine, SAM or AdoMet) as the methyl group donor for the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, PE) to phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-N-methylethanolamine, PMME), PMME to phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-N,N-dimethylethanolamine, PDME), and PDME to phosphatidylcholine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, PC), producing S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine in each step (PubMed:12431977, PubMed:15927961). Responsible for approximately 30% of hepatic PC with the CDP-choline pathway accounting for the other 70% (Probable).
