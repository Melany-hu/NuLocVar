UniprotID	Q9NX07
Accession	Q9NX07;Q86SU7
EntryName	TSAP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA selenocysteine 1-associated protein 1 (SECp43) (tRNA selenocysteine-associated protein 1)
GeneName	TRNAU1AP SECP43 TRSPAP1
Length	287
Function	Involved in the early steps of selenocysteine biosynthesis and tRNA(Sec) charging to the later steps resulting in the cotranslational incorporation of selenocysteine into selenoproteins. Stabilizes the SECISBP2, EEFSEC and tRNA(Sec) complex. May be involved in the methylation of tRNA(Sec). Enhances efficiency of selenoproteins synthesis (By similarity).
