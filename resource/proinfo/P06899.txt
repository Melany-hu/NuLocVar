UniprotID	P06899
Accession	P06899;B2R4J4;O60816
EntryName	H2B1J_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type 1-J (Histone H2B.1) (Histone H2B.r) (H2B/r)
GeneName	H2BC11 H2BFR HIST1H2BJ
Length	126
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
