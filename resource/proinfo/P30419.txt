UniprotID	P30419
Accession	P30419;A8K7C1;Q9UE09
EntryName	NMT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycylpeptide N-tetradecanoyltransferase 1 (EC 2.3.1.97) (Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase 1) (HsNMT1) (NMT 1) (Type I N-myristoyltransferase) (Peptide N-myristoyltransferase 1) (Protein-lysine myristoyltransferase NMT1) (EC 2.3.1.-)
GeneName	NMT1 NMT
Length	496
Function	Adds a myristoyl group to the N-terminal glycine residue of certain cellular and viral proteins (PubMed:22865860, PubMed:25255805, PubMed:32686708, PubMed:34999170, PubMed:9353336, PubMed:9506952). Also able to mediate N-terminal lysine myristoylation of proteins: catalyzes myristoylation of ARF6 on both 'Gly-2' and 'Lys-3' (PubMed:32103017, PubMed:32111831). Lysine myristoylation is required to maintain ARF6 on membranes during the GTPase cycle (PubMed:32103017).
