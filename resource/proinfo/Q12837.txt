EntryName	PO4F2_HUMAN
ProteinName	POU domain, class 4, transcription factor 2 (Brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein 3B) (Brain-3B) (Brn-3B)
GeneName	POU4F2 BRN3B
Length	409
Function	Tissue-specific DNA-binding transcription factor involved in the development and differentiation of target cells (PubMed:19266028, PubMed:23805044). Functions either as activator or repressor modulating the rate of target gene transcription through RNA polymerase II enzyme in a promoter-dependent manner (PubMed:19266028, PubMed:23805044). Binds to the consensus octamer motif 5'-ATATA-3' of promoter of target genes. Plays a fundamental role in the gene regulatory network essential for retinal ganglion cell (RGC) differentiation. Binds to an octamer site to form a ternary complex with ISL1; cooperates positively with ISL1 and ISL2 to potentiate transcriptional activation of RGC target genes being involved in RGC fate commitment in the developing retina and RGC axon formation and pathfinding. Inhibits DLX1 and DLX2 transcriptional activities preventing DLX1- and DLX2-mediated ability to promote amacrine cell fate specification. In cooperation with TP53 potentiates transcriptional activation of BAX promoter activity increasing neuronal cell apoptosis. Negatively regulates BAX promoter activity in the absence of TP53. Acts as a transcriptional coactivator via its interaction with the transcription factor ESR1 by enhancing its effect on estrogen response element (ERE)-containing promoter. Antagonizes the transcriptional stimulatory activity of POU4F1 by preventing its binding to an octamer motif. Involved in TNFSF11-mediated terminal osteoclast differentiation (By similarity).
