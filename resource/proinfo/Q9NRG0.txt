UniprotID	Q9NRG0
Accession	Q9NRG0
EntryName	CHRC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chromatin accessibility complex protein 1 (CHRAC-1) (Chromatin accessibility complex 15 kDa protein) (CHRAC-15) (HuCHRAC15) (DNA polymerase epsilon subunit p15)
GeneName	CHRAC1 CHRAC15
Length	131
Function	Forms a complex with DNA polymerase epsilon subunit POLE3 and binds naked DNA, which is then incorporated into chromatin, aided by the nucleosome remodeling activity of ISWI/SNF2H and ACF1. Does not enhance nucleosome sliding activity of the ACF-5 ISWI chromatin remodeling complex (PubMed:14759371).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
