UniprotID	P52758
Accession	P52758;Q6FHU9;Q6IBG0
EntryName	RIDA_HUMAN
ProteinName	2-iminobutanoate/2-iminopropanoate deaminase (EC 3.5.99.10) (14.5 kDa translational inhibitor protein) (hp14.5) (p14.5) (Heat-responsive protein 12) (Reactive intermediate imine deaminase A homolog) (Translation inhibitor L-PSP ribonuclease) (UK114 antigen homolog)
GeneName	RIDA HRSP12
Length	137
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of enamine/imine intermediates that form during the course of normal metabolism. May facilitate the release of ammonia from these potentially toxic reactive metabolites, reducing their impact on cellular components. It may act on enamine/imine intermediates formed by several types of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent dehydratases including L-threonine dehydratase.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Peroxisome; Mitochondrion
