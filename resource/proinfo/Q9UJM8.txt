EntryName	HAOX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	2-Hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (HAOX1) (EC 1.1.3.15) (Glycolate oxidase) (GO) (GOX) (Glyoxylate oxidase) (EC 1.2.3.5)
GeneName	HAO1 GOX1
Length	370
Function	Broad substrate specificity (S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase that preferentially oxidizes glycolate (PubMed:10777549, PubMed:10978532, PubMed:17669354, PubMed:18215067). The glyoxylate produced by the oxidation of glycolate can then be utilized by alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase for the peroxisomal synthesis of glycine; this pathway appears to be an important step for the detoxification of glyoxylate which, if allowed to accumulate, may be metabolized to oxalate with formation of kidney stones (PubMed:10978532, PubMed:17669354). Can also catalyze the oxidation of glyoxylate, and long chain hydroxyacids such as 2-hydroxyhexadecanoate and 2-hydroxyoctanoate, albeit with much lower catalytic efficiency (PubMed:10777549, PubMed:17669354, PubMed:18215067). Active in vitro with the artificial electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP), but O2 is believed to be the physiological electron acceptor, leading to the production of H2O2 (PubMed:10777549, PubMed:10978532, PubMed:17669354, PubMed:18215067). Is not active on L-lactate and 2-hydroxybutanoate (PubMed:10777549).
