EntryName	IF5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (eIF-5)
GeneName	EIF5
Length	431
Function	Component of the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC), which binds to the mRNA cap-proximal region, scans mRNA 5'-untranslated region, and locates the initiation codon (PubMed:11166181, PubMed:22813744, PubMed:24319994). In this complex, acts as a GTPase-activating protein, by promoting GTP hydrolysis by eIF2G (EIF2S3) (PubMed:11166181). During scanning, interacts with both EIF1 (via its C-terminal domain (CTD)) and EIF1A (via its NTD) (PubMed:22813744). This interaction with EIF1A contributes to the maintenance of EIF1 within the open 43S PIC (PubMed:24319994). When start codon is recognized, EIF5, via its NTD, induces eIF2G (EIF2S3) to hydrolyze the GTP (PubMed:11166181). Start codon recognition also induces a conformational change of the PIC to a closed state (PubMed:22813744). This change increases the affinity of EIF5-CTD for EIF2-beta (EIF2S2), which allows the release, by an indirect mechanism, of EIF1 from the PIC (PubMed:22813744). Finally, EIF5 stabilizes the PIC in its closed conformation (PubMed:22813744).
