EntryName	CNDP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytosolic non-specific dipeptidase (EC 3.4.13.18) (CNDP dipeptidase 2) (Glutamate carboxypeptidase-like protein 1) (Peptidase A) (Threonyl dipeptidase)
GeneName	CNDP2 CN2 CPGL HEL-S-13 PEPA
Length	475
Function	Catalyzes the peptide bond hydrolysis in dipeptides, displaying a non-redundant activity toward threonyl dipeptides (By similarity). Mediates threonyl dipeptide catabolism in a tissue-specific way (By similarity). Has high dipeptidase activity toward cysteinylglycine, an intermediate metabolite in glutathione metabolism (PubMed:12473676, PubMed:19346245). Metabolizes N-lactoyl-amino acids, both through hydrolysis to form lactic acid and amino acids, as well as through their formation by reverse proteolysis (PubMed:25964343). Plays a role in the regulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (PubMed:17121880, PubMed:24395568).
