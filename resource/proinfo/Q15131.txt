EntryName	CDK10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-dependent kinase 10 (EC 2.7.11.22) (Cell division protein kinase 10) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase PISSLRE)
GeneName	CDK10
Length	360
Function	Cyclin-dependent kinase that phosphorylates the transcription factor ETS2 (in vitro) and positively controls its proteasomal degradation (in cells) (PubMed:24218572). Involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization through the phosphorylation of actin dynamics regulators such as PKN2. Is a negative regulator of ciliogenesis through phosphorylation of PKN2 and promotion of RhoA signaling (PubMed:27104747).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium basal body
