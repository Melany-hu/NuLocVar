ProteinName	Catenin beta-1 (Beta-catenin)
GeneName	CTNNB1 CTNNB OK/SW-cl.35 PRO2286
Length	781
Function	Key downstream component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (PubMed:17524503, PubMed:18077326, PubMed:18086858, PubMed:18957423, PubMed:21262353, PubMed:22155184, PubMed:22647378, PubMed:22699938). In the absence of Wnt, forms a complex with AXIN1, AXIN2, APC, CSNK1A1 and GSK3B that promotes phosphorylation on N-terminal Ser and Thr residues and ubiquitination of CTNNB1 via BTRC and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:17524503, PubMed:18077326, PubMed:18086858, PubMed:18957423, PubMed:21262353, PubMed:22155184, PubMed:22647378, PubMed:22699938). In the presence of Wnt ligand, CTNNB1 is not ubiquitinated and accumulates in the nucleus, where it acts as a coactivator for transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family, leading to activate Wnt responsive genes (PubMed:17524503, PubMed:18077326, PubMed:18086858, PubMed:18957423, PubMed:21262353, PubMed:22155184, PubMed:22647378, PubMed:22699938). Also acts as a coactivator for other transcription factors, such as NR5A2 (PubMed:22187462). Promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition/mesenchymal to epithelial transition (EMT/MET) via driving transcription of CTNNB1/TCF-target genes (PubMed:29910125). Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, as component of an E-cadherin:catenin adhesion complex (By similarity). Acts as a negative regulator of centrosome cohesion (PubMed:18086858). Involved in the CDK2/PTPN6/CTNNB1/CEACAM1 pathway of insulin internalization (PubMed:21262353). Blocks anoikis of malignant kidney and intestinal epithelial cells and promotes their anchorage-independent growth by down-regulating DAPK2 (PubMed:18957423). Disrupts PML function and PML-NB formation by inhibiting RANBP2-mediated sumoylation of PML (PubMed:22155184). Promotes neurogenesis by maintaining sympathetic neuroblasts within the cell cycle (By similarity). Involved in chondrocyte differentiation via interaction with SOX9: SOX9-binding competes with the binding sites of TCF/LEF within CTNNB1, thereby inhibiting the Wnt signaling (By similarity). Acts as a positive regulator of odontoblast differentiation during mesenchymal tooth germ formation, via promoting the transcription of differentiation factors such as LEF1, BMP2 and BMP4 (By similarity). Activity is repressed in a MSX1-mediated manner at the bell stage of mesenchymal tooth germ formation which prevents premature differentiation of odontoblasts (By similarity).
