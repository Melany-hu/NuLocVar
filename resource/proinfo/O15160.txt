UniprotID	O15160
Accession	O15160;O75395;Q5JTE3
EntryName	RPAC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerases I and III subunit RPAC1 (DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit C) (RNA polymerases I and III subunit AC1) (AC40) (DNA-directed RNA polymerases I and III 40 kDa polypeptide) (RPA40) (RPA39) (RPC40)
GeneName	POLR1C POLR1E
Length	346
Function	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Common component of RNA polymerases I and III which synthesize ribosomal RNA precursors and short non-coding RNAs including 5S rRNA, snRNAs, tRNAs and miRNAs, respectively. POLR1C/RPAC1 is part of the polymerase core and may function as a clamp element that moves to open and close the cleft.
