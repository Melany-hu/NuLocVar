UniprotID	P09466
Accession	P09466;Q5T6T1;Q9UG92
EntryName	PAEP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycodelin (GD) (Placental protein 14) (PP14) (Pregnancy-associated endometrial alpha-2 globulin) (PAEG) (PEG) (Progestagen-associated endometrial protein) (Progesterone-associated endometrial protein) (Zona-binding inhibitory factor-1) (ZIF-1)
GeneName	PAEP
Length	180
Function	Glycoprotein that regulates critical steps during fertilization and also has immunomonomodulatory effects. Four glycoforms, namely glycodelin-S, -A, -F and -C have been identified in reproductive tissues that differ in glycosylation and biological activity. Glycodelin-A has contraceptive and immunosuppressive activities (PubMed:7531163, PubMed:9918684). Glycodelin-C stimulates binding of spermatozoa to the zona pellucida (PubMed:17192260). Glycodelin-F inhibits spermatozoa-zona pellucida binding and significantly suppresses progesterone-induced acrosome reaction of spermatozoa (PubMed:12672671). Glycodelin-S in seminal plasma maintains the uncapacitated state of human spermatozoa (PubMed:15883155).
