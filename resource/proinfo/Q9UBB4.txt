UniprotID	Q9UBB4
Accession	Q9UBB4;A6NLC4;B4DG05;O14998;O15009;Q6I9X4
EntryName	ATX10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ataxin-10 (Brain protein E46 homolog) (Spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 protein)
GeneName	ATXN10 SCA10
Length	475
Function	May play a role in the regulation of cytokinesis (PubMed:21857149, PubMed:25666058). May play a role in signaling by stimulating protein glycosylation. Induces neuritogenesis by activating the Ras-MAP kinase pathway and is necessary for the survival of cerebellar neurons (By similarity). Does not appear to play a major role in ciliogenesis (By similarity).
