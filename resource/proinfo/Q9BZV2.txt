UniprotID	Q9BZV2
Accession	Q9BZV2
EntryName	S19A3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thiamine transporter 2 (ThTr-2) (ThTr2) (Solute carrier family 19 member 3)
GeneName	SLC19A3
Length	496
Function	Mediates high affinity thiamine uptake, probably via a proton anti-port mechanism (PubMed:11731220, PubMed:33008889, PubMed:35512554, PubMed:35724964). Has no folate transport activity (PubMed:11731220). Mediates H(+)-dependent pyridoxine transport (PubMed:33008889, PubMed:35512554, PubMed:35724964, PubMed:36456177).
Subcellular Location	Membrane
