UniprotID	Q9HBH0
Accession	Q9HBH0;Q8WVB1;Q9NXH6
EntryName	RHOF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoF (Rho family GTPase Rif) (Rho in filopodia)
GeneName	RHOF ARHF RIF
Length	211
Function	Plasma membrane-associated small GTPase which cycles between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound state. Causes the formation of thin, actin-rich surface projections called filopodia. Functions cooperatively with CDC42 and Rac to generate additional structures, increasing the diversity of actin-based morphology.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
