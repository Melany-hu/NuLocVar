UniprotID	Q6J4K2
Accession	Q6J4K2;A6NP50;Q4KMS9;Q6J4K1;Q9H6I8
EntryName	NCLX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial sodium/calcium exchanger protein (Na(+)/K(+)/Ca(2+)-exchange protein 6) (Sodium/calcium exchanger protein, mitochondrial) (Sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 6) (Solute carrier family 24 member 6) (Solute carrier family 8 member B1)
GeneName	SLC8B1 NCKX6 NCLX SLC24A6
Length	584
Function	Mitochondrial sodium/calcium antiporter that mediates sodium-dependent calcium efflux from mitochondrion, by mediating the exchange of 3 sodium ions per 1 calcium ion (PubMed:15060069, PubMed:20018762, PubMed:22829870, PubMed:23056385, PubMed:24898248, PubMed:28130126, PubMed:28219928). Plays a central role in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis by mediating mitochondrial calcium extrusion: calcium efflux is essential for mitochondrial function and cell survival, notably in cardiomyocytes (By similarity). Regulates rates of glucose-dependent insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells during the first phase of insulin secretion: acts by mediating efflux of calcium from mitochondrion, thereby affecting cytoplasmic calcium responses (PubMed:23056385). Required for store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) and Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel regulation: sodium transport by SLC8B1 leads to promote calcium-shuttling that modulates mitochondrial redox status, thereby regulating SOCE activity (PubMed:28219928). Involved in B-lymphocyte chemotaxis (By similarity). Able to transport Ca(2+) in exchange of either Li(+) or Na(+), explaining how Li(+) catalyzes Ca(2+) exchange (PubMed:15060069, PubMed:28130126). In contrast to other members of the family its function is independent of K(+) (PubMed:15060069).
