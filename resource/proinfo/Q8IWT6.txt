EntryName	LRC8A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Volume-regulated anion channel subunit LRRC8A (Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 8A) (HsLRRC8A) (Swelling protein 1)
GeneName	LRRC8A KIAA1437 LRRC8 SWELL1 UNQ221/PRO247
Length	810
Function	Essential component of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC, also named VSOAC channel), an anion channel required to maintain a constant cell volume in response to extracellular or intracellular osmotic changes (PubMed:24725410, PubMed:24790029, PubMed:26530471, PubMed:26824658, PubMed:28193731, PubMed:29769723). The VRAC channel conducts iodide better than chloride and can also conduct organic osmolytes like taurine (PubMed:24725410, PubMed:24790029, PubMed:26530471, PubMed:26824658, PubMed:28193731, PubMed:30095067). Mediates efflux of amino acids, such as aspartate and glutamate, in response to osmotic stress (PubMed:28193731). LRRC8A and LRRC8D are required for the uptake of the drug cisplatin (PubMed:26530471). In complex with LRRC8C or LRRC8E, acts as a transporter of immunoreactive cyclic dinucleotide GMP-AMP (2'-3'-cGAMP), an immune messenger produced in response to DNA virus in the cytosol: mediates both import and export of 2'-3'-cGAMP, thereby promoting transfer of 2'-3'-cGAMP to bystander cells (PubMed:33171122). In contrast, complexes containing LRRC8D inhibit transport of 2'-3'-cGAMP (PubMed:33171122). Required for in vivo channel activity, together with at least one other family member (LRRC8B, LRRC8C, LRRC8D or LRRC8E); channel characteristics depend on the precise subunit composition (PubMed:24790029, PubMed:26824658, PubMed:28193731). Can form functional channels by itself (in vitro) (PubMed:26824658). Involved in B-cell development: required for the pro-B cell to pre-B cell transition (PubMed:14660746). Also required for T-cell development (By similarity). Required for myoblast differentiation: VRAC activity promotes membrane hyperpolarization and regulates insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism and oxygen consumption (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of glucose-sensing in pancreatic beta cells: VRAC currents, generated in response to hypotonicity- or glucose-induced beta cell swelling, depolarize cells, thereby causing electrical excitation, leading to increase glucose sensitivity and insulin secretion (PubMed:29371604). Also plays a role in lysosome homeostasis by forming functional lysosomal VRAC channels in response to low cytoplasmic ionic strength condition: lysosomal VRAC channels are necessary for the formation of large lysosome-derived vacuoles, which store and then expel excess water to maintain cytosolic water homeostasis (PubMed:31270356, PubMed:33139539).
