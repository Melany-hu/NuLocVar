EntryName	SFRP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP-4) (Frizzled protein, human endometrium) (FrpHE)
GeneName	SFRP4 FRPHE
Length	346
Function	Soluble frizzled-related proteins (sFRPS) function as modulators of Wnt signaling through direct interaction with Wnts. They have a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation in specific cell types (By similarity). SFRP4 plays a role in bone morphogenesis. May also act as a regulator of adult uterine morphology and function. May also increase apoptosis during ovulation possibly through modulation of FZ1/FZ4/WNT4 signaling (By similarity). Has phosphaturic effects by specifically inhibiting sodium-dependent phosphate uptake (PubMed:12952927).
