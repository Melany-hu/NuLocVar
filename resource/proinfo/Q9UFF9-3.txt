UniprotID	Q9UFF9-3
Accession	Q9UFF9;B0AZS3;B2RAR8;B7Z8R1;D3DQI8;O95709;Q7Z521;Q9H6Y1
EntryName	CNOT8_HUMAN
ProteinName	CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 8 (EC 3.1.13.4) (CAF1-like protein) (CALIFp) (CAF2) (CCR4-associated factor 8) (Caf1b)
GeneName	CNOT8 CALIF POP2
Length	238
Function	Has 3'-5' poly(A) exoribonuclease activity for synthetic poly(A) RNA substrate. Its function seems to be partially redundant with that of CNOT7. Catalytic component of the CCR4-NOT complex which is linked to various cellular processes including bulk mRNA degradation, miRNA-mediated repression, translational repression during translational initiation and general transcription regulation. During miRNA-mediated repression the complex also seems to act as translational repressor during translational initiation. Additional complex functions may be a consequence of its influence on mRNA expression. Associates with members of the BTG family such as TOB1 and BTG2 and is required for their anti-proliferative activity.
