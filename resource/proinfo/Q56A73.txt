EntryName	SPIN4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Spindlin-4
GeneName	SPIN4
Length	249
Function	Binds to acetylated and methylated histones, including H3K4me3 and H4K20me3, probably acting as a histone reader that recognizes chromatin marks and mediates downstream cellular effects (PubMed:29061846, PubMed:36927955). Promotes canonical WNT signaling, and is involved in the down-regulation of cell proliferation (PubMed:36927955).
