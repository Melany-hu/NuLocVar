UniprotID	O75319
Accession	O75319;B2RCT8;C9JYA6;Q6AI47;Q9BWE3
EntryName	DUS11_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA/RNP complex-1-interacting phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.-) (Dual specificity protein phosphatase 11) (Phosphatase that interacts with RNA/RNP complex 1)
GeneName	DUSP11 PIR1
Length	330
Function	Possesses RNA 5'-triphosphatase and diphosphatase activities, but displays a poor protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. In addition, has phosphatase activity with ATP, ADP and O-methylfluorescein phosphate (in vitro). Binds to RNA. May participate in nuclear mRNA metabolism.
