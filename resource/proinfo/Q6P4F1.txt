Accession	Q6P4F1;A8KAC8;Q70GG3;Q8IVI6;Q8IVI7;Q8IVJ3;Q8TE43;Q9BSR3
EntryName	OFUT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	GDP-fucose protein O-fucosyltransferase 3 (EC 2.4.1.221) (Alpha-(1,3)-fucosyltransferase 10) (EC 2.4.1.-) (Fucosyltransferase X) (Fuc-TX) (FucT-X) (Galactoside 3-L-fucosyltransferase 10) (Fucosyltransferase 10)
GeneName	FUT10 POFUT3
Length	479
Function	Protein O-fucosyltransferase that specifically catalyzes O-fucosylation of serine or threonine residues in EMI domains of target proteins, such as MMRN1, MMRN2 and EMID1 (PubMed:39775168). Attaches fucose through an O-glycosidic linkage (PubMed:39775168). O-fucosylation of EMI domain-containing proteins may be required for facilitating protein folding and secretion (PubMed:39775168). May also show alpha-(1,3)-fucosyltransferase activity toward the innermost N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) residue in biantennary N-glycan acceptors (PubMed:19088067). However, this was tested with a library of synthetic substrates and this activity is unsure in vivo (PubMed:19088067). May be involved in biosynthesis of Lewis X-carrying biantennary N-glycans that regulate neuron stem cell self-renewal during brain development (By similarity).
