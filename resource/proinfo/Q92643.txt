EntryName	GPI8_HUMAN
ProteinName	GPI-anchor transamidase (GPI transamidase) (EC 3.-.-.-) (GPI8 homolog) (hGPI8) (Phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class K protein) (PIG-K)
GeneName	PIGK GPI8
Length	395
Function	Component of the GPI transamidase complex, necessary for transfer of GPI to proteins (PubMed:34576938). Mediates GPI anchoring in the endoplasmic reticulum, by replacing a protein's C-terminal GPI attachment signal peptide with a pre-assembled GPI. During this transamidation reaction, the GPI transamidase forms a carbonyl intermediate with the substrate protein.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
