UniprotID	Q99418
Accession	Q99418;A8K8P0;Q8IXY9;Q92958
EntryName	CYH2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytohesin-2 (ARF exchange factor) (ARF nucleotide-binding site opener) (Protein ARNO) (PH, SEC7 and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	CYTH2 ARNO PSCD2 PSCD2L
Length	400
Function	Acts as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Promotes guanine-nucleotide exchange on ARF1, ARF3 and ARF6. Activates ARF factors through replacement of GDP with GTP (By similarity). The cell membrane form, in association with ARL4 proteins, recruits ARF6 to the plasma membrane (PubMed:17398095). Involved in neurite growth (By similarity).
