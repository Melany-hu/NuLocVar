UniprotID	Q8IVB4
Accession	Q8IVB4;A6NMQ9;Q3LIC2;Q5JPI6;Q5WA58;Q8NAB9
EntryName	SL9A9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium/hydrogen exchanger 9 (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 9) (NHE-9) (Solute carrier family 9 member 9)
GeneName	SLC9A9 NHE9 Nbla00118
Length	645
Function	Endosomal Na(+), K(+)/H(+) antiporter. Mediates the electroneutral exchange of endosomal luminal H(+) for a cytosolic Na(+) or K(+) (Probable). By facilitating proton efflux, SLC9A9 counteracts the acidity generated by vacuolar (V)-ATPase, thereby limiting luminal acidification. Regulates organellar pH and consequently, e.g., endosome maturation and endocytic trafficking of plasma membrane receptors and neurotransporters (PubMed:15522866, PubMed:24065030, PubMed:28130443). Promotes the recycling of transferrin receptors back to the cell surface to facilitate additional iron uptake in the brain (PubMed:28130443). Regulates synaptic transmission by regulating the luminal pH of axonal endosomes (By similarity). Regulates phagosome lumenal pH, thus affecting phagosome maturation, and consequently, microbicidal activity in macrophages (By similarity). Can also be active at the cell surface of specialized cells, e.g., in the inner ear hair bundles uses the high K(+) of the endolymph to regulate intracelular pH (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Late endosome membrane; Early endosome membrane; Recycling endosome membrane; Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Phagosome membrane
