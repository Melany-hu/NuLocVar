UniprotID	Q9H6P5
Accession	Q9H6P5;B7Z690;B7Z963;Q5TDU9;Q9BQN0;Q9NQ08;Q9NTS6;Q9NXJ2
EntryName	TASP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Threonine aspartase 1 (Taspase-1) (EC 3.4.25.-) [Cleaved into: Threonine aspartase subunit alpha; Threonine aspartase subunit beta]
GeneName	TASP1 C20orf13
Length	420
Function	Protease responsible for KMT2A/MLL1 processing and activation (PubMed:14636557). It also activates KMT2D/MLL2 (By similarity). Through substrate activation, it controls the expression of HOXA genes, and the expression of key cell cycle regulators including CCNA1, CCNB1, CCNE1 and CDKN2A (By similarity) (PubMed:14636557).
