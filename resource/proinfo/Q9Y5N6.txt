UniprotID	Q9Y5N6
Accession	Q9Y5N6;B3KN89
EntryName	ORC6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Origin recognition complex subunit 6
GeneName	ORC6 ORC6L
Length	252
Function	Component of the origin recognition complex (ORC) that binds origins of replication. DNA-binding is ATP-dependent. The specific DNA sequences that define origins of replication have not been identified yet. ORC is required to assemble the pre-replication complex necessary to initiate DNA replication. Does not bind histone H3 and H4 trimethylation marks H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H4K20me3.
