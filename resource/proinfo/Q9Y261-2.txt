UniprotID	Q9Y261-2
Accession	Q9Y261;Q8WUW4;Q96DF7
EntryName	FOXA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3-beta (HNF-3-beta) (HNF-3B) (Forkhead box protein A2) (Transcription factor 3B) (TCF-3B)
GeneName	FOXA2 HNF3B TCF3B
Length	463
Function	Transcription factor that is involved in embryonic development, establishment of tissue-specific gene expression and regulation of gene expression in differentiated tissues. Is thought to act as a 'pioneer' factor opening the compacted chromatin for other proteins through interactions with nucleosomal core histones and thereby replacing linker histones at target enhancer and/or promoter sites. Binds DNA with the consensus sequence 5'-ATTTT-3' (By similarity). In embryonic development is required for notochord formation. Involved in the development of multiple endoderm-derived organ systems such as the liver, pancreas and lungs; FOXA1 and FOXA2 seem to have at least in part redundant roles. Originally described as a transcription activator for a number of liver genes such as AFP, albumin, tyrosine aminotransferase, PEPCK, etc. Interacts with the cis-acting regulatory regions of these genes. Involved in glucose homeostasis; regulates the expression of genes important for glucose sensing in pancreatic beta-cells and glucose homeostasis. Involved in regulation of fat metabolism. Binds to fibrinogen beta promoter and is involved in IL6-induced fibrinogen beta transcriptional activation.
