UniprotID	Q9NPC3
Accession	Q9NPC3
EntryName	CIP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CCNB1IP1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Cyclin-B1-interacting protein 1) (Human enhancer of invasion 10) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase CCNB1IP1)
GeneName	CCNB1IP1 C14orf18 HEI10
Length	277
Function	Ubiquitin E3 ligase that acts as a limiting factor for crossing-over during meiosis: required during zygonema to limit the colocalization of RNF212 with MutS-gamma-associated recombination sites and thereby establish early differentiation of crossover and non-crossover sites. Later, it is directed by MutL-gamma to stably accumulate at designated crossover sites. Probably promotes the dissociation of RNF212 and MutS-gamma to allow the progression of recombination and the implementation of the final steps of crossing over (By similarity). Modulates cyclin-B levels and participates in the regulation of cell cycle progression through the G2 phase. Overexpression causes delayed entry into mitosis.
