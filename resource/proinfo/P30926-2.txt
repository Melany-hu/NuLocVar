Function	Component of neuronal acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that function as pentameric, ligand-gated cation channels with high calcium permeability among other activities. nAChRs are excitatory neurotrasnmitter receptors formed by a collection of nAChR subunits known to mediate synaptic transmission in the nervous system and the neuromuscular junction. Each nAchR subunit confers differential attributes to channel properties, including activation, deactivation and desensitization kinetics, pH sensitivity, cation permeability, and binding to allosteric modulators (PubMed:20881005, PubMed:31488329, PubMed:8663494, PubMed:8906617, PubMed:9203638). CHRNB4 forms heteropentameric neuronal acetylcholine receptors with CHRNA2, CHRNA3 and CHRNA4, as well as CHRNA5 and CHRNB3 as accesory subunits (PubMed:11118490, PubMed:20881005, PubMed:8663494). CHRNA3:CHRNB4 being predominant in neurons of the autonomic ganglia, it is known as ganglionic nicotinic receptor (PubMed:31488329). CHRNA3:CHRNB4 or CHRNA3:CHRNA5:CHRNB4 play also an important role in the habenulo-interpeduncular tract, modulating the mesolimbic dopamine system and affecting reward circuits and addiction (By similarity). Hypothalamic CHRNA3:CHRNB4 nAChR activation by nicotine leads to activation of POMC neurons and a decrease in food intake (By similarity).
