UniprotID	Q08830
Accession	Q08830;A6NKU4;Q4PJH9;Q53YF1;Q8NG32;Q96KW6;Q96QM6
EntryName	FGL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (HP-041) (Hepassocin) (HPS) (Hepatocyte-derived fibrinogen-related protein 1) (HFREP-1) (Liver fibrinogen-related protein 1) (LFIRE-1)
GeneName	FGL1 HFREP1
Length	312
Function	Immune suppressive molecule that inhibits antigen-specific T-cell activation by acting as a major ligand of LAG3 (PubMed:30580966). Responsible for LAG3 T-cell inhibitory function (PubMed:30580966). Binds LAG3 independently from MHC class II (MHC-II) (PubMed:30580966). Secreted by, and promotes growth of, hepatocytes (PubMed:11470158, PubMed:19880967).
