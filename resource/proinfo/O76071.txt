EntryName	CIAO1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly protein CIAO1 (WD repeat-containing protein 39)
GeneName	CIAO1 CIA1 WDR39
Length	339
Function	Key component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates the incorporation of iron-sulfur cluster into extramitochondrial Fe/S proteins (PubMed:17937914, PubMed:23891004, PubMed:38950322). As a CIA complex component, interacts specifically with CIAO2A or CIAO2B and MMS19 to assist different branches of iron-sulfur protein assembly, depending of its interactors. The complex CIAO1:CIAO2B:MMS19 binds to and facilitates the assembly of most cytosolic-nuclear Fe/S proteins. CIAO1:CIAO2A specifically matures ACO1 and stabilizes IREB2 (PubMed:23891004). Seems to specifically modulate the transactivation activity of WT1 (PubMed:9556563). As part of the mitotic spindle-associated MMXD complex it may play a role in chromosome segregation (PubMed:20797633).
