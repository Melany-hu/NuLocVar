EntryName	CNOT4_HUMAN
ProteinName	CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 4 (EC 2.3.2.27) (CCR4-associated factor 4) (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CNOT4) (Potential transcriptional repressor NOT4Hp) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase CNOT4)
GeneName	CNOT4 NOT4
Length	575
Function	Has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, promoting ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins (PubMed:11823428, PubMed:22159038, PubMed:26575292). Involved in activation of the JAK/STAT pathway (PubMed:11823428, PubMed:22159038). Catalyzes ubiquitination of methylated RBM15 (PubMed:26575292). Plays a role in quality control of translation of mitochondrial outer membrane-localized mRNA (PubMed:29861391). As part of the PINK1-regulated signaling, upon mitochondria damage, ubiquitinates ABCE1 and thereby recruits autophagy receptors to the mitochondrial outer membrane to initiate mitophagy (PubMed:29861391).
