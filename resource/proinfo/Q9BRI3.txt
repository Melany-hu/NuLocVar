EntryName	ZNT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proton-coupled zinc antiporter SLC30A2 (Solute carrier family 30 member 2) (Zinc transporter 2) (ZnT-2)
GeneName	SLC30A2 ZNT2
Length	372
Function	Electroneutral proton-coupled antiporter concentrating zinc ions into a variety of intracellular organelles including endosomes, zymogen granules and mitochondria. Thereby, plays a crucial role in cellular zinc homeostasis to confer upon cells protection against its potential cytotoxicity (PubMed:17065149, PubMed:21289295, PubMed:22733820, PubMed:25657003, PubMed:25808614, PubMed:30893306). Regulates the zinc concentration of milk, through the transport of zinc ions into secretory vesicles of mammary cells (PubMed:19496757). By concentrating zinc ions into lysosomes participates to lysosomal-mediated cell death during early mammary gland involution (PubMed:25808614).
