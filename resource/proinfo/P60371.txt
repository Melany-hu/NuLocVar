UniprotID	P60371
Accession	P60371
EntryName	KR106_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 10-6 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.6) (Keratin-associated protein 10.6) (Keratin-associated protein 18-6) (Keratin-associated protein 18.6)
GeneName	KRTAP10-6 KAP10.6 KAP18-6 KRTAP10.6 KRTAP18-6 KRTAP18.6
Length	365
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
