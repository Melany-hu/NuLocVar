UniprotID	Q5TGU0
Accession	Q5TGU0;B2RPR2;B7ZMN8;Q3SX82
EntryName	TSPO2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Translocator protein 2 (Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor-like protein 1)
GeneName	TSPO2 BZRPL1
Length	170
Function	Cholesterol-binding protein involved in the redistribution of cholesterol from lipid droplets to the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:19729679). Required to meet cholesterol demands during erythropoietic differentiation (PubMed:19729679). May play a role in transport processes at the plasma membrane of erythrocytes, including regulating VDAC-mediated ATP export, and import of the heme precursors protoporphyrin IX and 5-aminolevulinic acid (PubMed:27641616, PubMed:30061676, PubMed:31989647).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Cell membrane
