UniprotID	Q99801-3
Accession	Q99801;O15465;Q9H2P4;Q9H2P5;Q9H2P6;Q9H2P7;Q9HBG0
EntryName	NKX31_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein Nkx-3.1 (Homeobox protein NK-3 homolog A)
GeneName	NKX3-1 NKX3.1 NKX3A
Length	159
Function	Transcription factor, which binds preferentially the consensus sequence 5'-TAAGT-3' and can behave as a transcriptional repressor. Plays an important role in normal prostate development, regulating proliferation of glandular epithelium and in the formation of ducts in prostate. Acts as a tumor suppressor controlling prostate carcinogenesis, as shown by the ability to inhibit proliferation and invasion activities of PC-3 prostate cancer cells.
