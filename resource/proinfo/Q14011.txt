UniprotID	Q14011
Accession	Q14011;B3KT17;B4E2X2
EntryName	CIRBP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (A18 hnRNP) (Glycine-rich RNA-binding protein CIRP)
GeneName	CIRBP A18HNRNP CIRP
Length	172
Function	Cold-inducible mRNA binding protein that plays a protective role in the genotoxic stress response by stabilizing transcripts of genes involved in cell survival. Acts as a translational activator. Seems to play an essential role in cold-induced suppression of cell proliferation. Binds specifically to the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of stress-responsive transcripts RPA2 and TXN. Acts as a translational repressor (By similarity). Promotes assembly of stress granules (SGs), when overexpressed.
