UniprotID	Q6UX82
Accession	Q6UX82;A0A075B722;K7ELG6
EntryName	LYPD8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ly6/PLAUR domain-containing protein 8
GeneName	LYPD8 UNQ511/PRO1026
Length	237
Function	Secreted protein specifically required to prevent invasion of Gram-negative bacteria in the inner mucus layer of the colon epithelium, a portion of the large intestine which is free of commensal microbiota. Prevents invasion of flagellated microbiota by binding to the flagellum of bacteria, such as P.mirabilis, thereby inhibiting bacterial motility in the intestinal lumen. Segregation of intestinal bacteria and epithelial cells in the colon is required to preserve intestinal homeostasis.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted
