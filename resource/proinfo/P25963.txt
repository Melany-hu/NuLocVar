UniprotID	P25963
Accession	P25963;B2R8L6
EntryName	IKBA_HUMAN
ProteinName	NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (I-kappa-B-alpha) (IkB-alpha) (IkappaBalpha) (Major histocompatibility complex enhancer-binding protein MAD3)
GeneName	NFKBIA IKBA MAD3 NFKBI
Length	317
Function	Inhibits the activity of dimeric NF-kappa-B/REL complexes by trapping REL (RELA/p65 and NFKB1/p50) dimers in the cytoplasm by masking their nuclear localization signals (PubMed:1493333, PubMed:36651806, PubMed:7479976). On cellular stimulation by immune and pro-inflammatory responses, becomes phosphorylated promoting ubiquitination and degradation, enabling the dimeric RELA to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription (PubMed:7479976, PubMed:7628694, PubMed:7796813, PubMed:7878466).
