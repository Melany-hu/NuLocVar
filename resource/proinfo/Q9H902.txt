UniprotID	Q9H902
Accession	Q9H902;B7Z4D7;B7Z4F2;B7Z5R9;D6W5M2;Q53TI0
EntryName	REEP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Receptor expression-enhancing protein 1 (Spastic paraplegia 31 protein)
GeneName	REEP1 C2orf23 SPG31
Length	201
Function	Required for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network formation, shaping and remodeling; it links ER tubules to the cytoskeleton. May also enhance the cell surface expression of odorant receptors (PubMed:20200447). May play a role in long-term axonal maintenance (PubMed:24478229).
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Mitochondrion membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum
