UniprotID	O75844
Accession	O75844;B3KQI7;D3DPU7;Q8NDZ8;Q9UBQ2
EntryName	FACE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	CAAX prenyl protease 1 homolog (EC 3.4.24.84) (Farnesylated proteins-converting enzyme 1) (FACE-1) (Prenyl protein-specific endoprotease 1) (Zinc metalloproteinase Ste24 homolog)
GeneName	ZMPSTE24 FACE1 STE24
Length	475
Function	Transmembrane metalloprotease whose catalytic activity is critical for processing lamin A/LMNA on the inner nuclear membrane and clearing clogged translocons on the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:33293369, PubMed:33315887). Proteolytically removes the C-terminal three residues of farnesylated proteins (PubMed:33293369, PubMed:33315887). Also plays an antiviral role independently of its protease activity by restricting enveloped RNA and DNA viruses, including influenza A, Zika, Ebola, Sindbis, vesicular stomatitis, cowpox, and vaccinia (PubMed:28169297, PubMed:28246125). Mechanistically, controls IFITM antiviral pathway to hinder viruses from breaching the endosomal barrier by modulating membrane fluidity (PubMed:35283811).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Nucleus inner membrane; Early endosome membrane; Late endosome membrane
