UniprotID	Q9BQ69
Accession	Q9BQ69;Q9UH96
EntryName	MACD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribose glycohydrolase MACROD1 (MACRO domain-containing protein 1) (O-acetyl-ADP-ribose deacetylase MACROD1) (EC 3.1.1.106) (Protein LRP16) ([Protein ADP-ribosylaspartate] hydrolase MACROD1) (EC 3.2.2.-) ([Protein ADP-ribosylglutamate] hydrolase MACROD1) (EC 3.2.2.-)
GeneName	MACROD1 LRP16
Length	325
Function	Removes ADP-ribose from aspartate and glutamate residues in proteins bearing a single ADP-ribose moiety (PubMed:23474712, PubMed:23474714). Inactive towards proteins bearing poly-ADP-ribose (PubMed:23474712, PubMed:23474714). Deacetylates O-acetyl-ADP ribose, a signaling molecule generated by the deacetylation of acetylated lysine residues in histones and other proteins (PubMed:21257746). Plays a role in estrogen signaling (PubMed:17893710, PubMed:17914104, PubMed:19403568). Binds to androgen receptor (AR) and amplifies the transactivation function of AR in response to androgen (PubMed:19022849). May play an important role in carcinogenesis and/or progression of hormone-dependent cancers by feed-forward mechanism that activates ESR1 transactivation (PubMed:17893710, PubMed:17914104). Could be an ESR1 coactivator, providing a positive feedback regulatory loop for ESR1 signal transduction (PubMed:17914104). Could be involved in invasive growth by down-regulating CDH1 in endometrial cancer cells (PubMed:17893710). Enhances ESR1-mediated transcription activity (PubMed:17914104).
