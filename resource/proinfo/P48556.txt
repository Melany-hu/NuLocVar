UniprotID	P48556
Accession	P48556;B4DX18;Q6P1L7
EntryName	PSMD8_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 8 (26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN12) (26S proteasome regulatory subunit S14) (p31)
GeneName	PSMD8
Length	350
Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair.
