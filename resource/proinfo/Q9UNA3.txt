UniprotID	Q9UNA3
Accession	Q9UNA3;Q0VDK1;Q0VDK2
EntryName	A4GCT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Alpha4GnT) (EC 2.4.1.-)
GeneName	A4GNT
Length	340
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to core 2 branched O-glycans (PubMed:10430883). Necessary for the synthesis of type III mucin which is specifically produced in the stomach, duodenum, and pancreatic duct (PubMed:10430883). May protect against inflammation-associated gastric adenocarcinomas (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
