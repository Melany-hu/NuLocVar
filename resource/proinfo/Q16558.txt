UniprotID	Q16558
Accession	Q16558;O00707;O00708;P78475;Q53YR0;Q8TAX3;Q93005
EntryName	KCMB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium-activated potassium channel subunit beta-1 (BK channel subunit beta-1) (BKbeta) (BKbeta1) (Hbeta1) (Calcium-activated potassium channel, subfamily M subunit beta-1) (Calcium-activated potassium channel subunit beta) (Charybdotoxin receptor subunit beta-1) (K(VCA)beta-1) (Maxi K channel subunit beta-1) (Slo-beta-1) (Slo-beta)
GeneName	KCNMB1
Length	191
Function	Regulatory subunit of the calcium activated potassium KCNMA1 (maxiK) channel. Modulates the calcium sensitivity and gating kinetics of KCNMA1, thereby contributing to KCNMA1 channel diversity. Increases the apparent Ca(2+)/voltage sensitivity of the KCNMA1 channel. It also modifies KCNMA1 channel kinetics and alters its pharmacological properties. It slows down the activation and the deactivation kinetics of the channel. Acts as a negative regulator of smooth muscle contraction by enhancing the calcium sensitivity to KCNMA1. Its presence is also a requirement for internal binding of the KCNMA1 channel opener dehydrosoyasaponin I (DHS-1) triterpene glycoside and for external binding of the agonist hormone 17-beta-estradiol (E2). Increases the binding activity of charybdotoxin (CTX) toxin to KCNMA1 peptide blocker by increasing the CTX association rate and decreasing the dissociation rate.
