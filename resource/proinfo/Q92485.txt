EntryName	ASM3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acid sphingomyelinase-like phosphodiesterase 3b (ASM-like phosphodiesterase 3b) (EC 3.1.4.-)
GeneName	SMPDL3B ASML3B ASMLPD
Length	455
Function	Lipid-modulating phosphodiesterase (PubMed:26095358). Active on the surface of macrophages and dendritic cells and strongly influences macrophage lipid composition and membrane fluidity. Acts as a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor signaling (By similarity). Has in vitro phosphodiesterase activity, but the physiological substrate is unknown (PubMed:26095358). Lacks activity with phosphocholine-containing lipids, but can cleave CDP-choline, and can release phosphate from ATP and ADP (in vitro) (By similarity).
