UniprotID	Q8N6L1
Accession	Q8N6L1;B2R4Q1;Q6PG45;Q86XW2;Q8IWS4
EntryName	KTAP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase subunit KCP2 (Oligosaccharyl transferase subunit KCP2) (Keratinocyte-associated protein 2) (KCP-2)
GeneName	KRTCAP2 KCP2
Length	136
Function	Subunit of STT3A-containing oligosaccharyl transferase (OST-A) complex that catalyzes the initial transfer of a defined glycan (Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) in eukaryotes) from the lipid carrier dolichol-pyrophosphate to an asparagine residue within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif in nascent polypeptide chains, the first step in protein N-glycosylation (PubMed:22467853, PubMed:28860277). N-glycosylation occurs cotranslationally and the complex associates with the Sec61 complex at the channel-forming translocon complex that mediates protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (PubMed:22467853, PubMed:28860277). Within the OST-A complex, acts as an adapter that anchors the OST-A complex to the Sec61 complex (PubMed:28860277). May be involved in N-glycosylation of APP (amyloid-beta precursor protein) (PubMed:21768116). Can modulate gamma-secretase cleavage of APP by enhancing endoprotelysis of PSEN1 (PubMed:21768116).
