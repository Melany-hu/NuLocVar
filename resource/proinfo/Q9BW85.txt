Accession	Q9BW85;O75270;Q9H862;Q9NW16
EntryName	YJU2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Splicing factor YJU2 (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 94)
GeneName	YJU2 CCDC94
Length	323
Function	Part of the spliceosome which catalyzes two sequential transesterification reactions, first the excision of the non-coding intron from pre-mRNA and then the ligation of the coding exons to form the mature mRNA (PubMed:29301961). Plays a role in stabilizing the structure of the spliceosome catalytic core and docking of the branch helix into the active site, producing 5'-exon and lariat intron-3'-intermediates (By similarity). May protect cells from TP53-dependent apoptosis upon dsDNA break damage through association with PRP19-CD5L complex (PubMed:22952453).
