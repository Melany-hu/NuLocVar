EntryName	TERF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TTAGGG repeat-binding factor 2) (Telomeric DNA-binding protein)
GeneName	TERF2 TRBF2 TRF2
Length	542
Function	Binds the telomeric double-stranded 5'-TTAGGG-3' repeat and plays a central role in telomere maintenance and protection against end-to-end fusion of chromosomes (PubMed:15608617, PubMed:16166375, PubMed:20655466, PubMed:28216226, PubMed:9326950, PubMed:9326951, PubMed:9476899). In addition to its telomeric DNA-binding role, required to recruit a number of factors and enzymes required for telomere protection, including the shelterin complex, TERF2IP/RAP1 and DCLRE1B/Apollo (PubMed:16166375, PubMed:20655466). Component of the shelterin complex (telosome) that is involved in the regulation of telomere length and protection (PubMed:16166375). Shelterin associates with arrays of double-stranded 5'-TTAGGG-3' repeats added by telomerase and protects chromosome ends; without its protective activity, telomeres are no longer hidden from the DNA damage surveillance and chromosome ends are inappropriately processed by DNA repair pathways (PubMed:16166375). Together with DCLRE1B/Apollo, plays a key role in telomeric loop (T loop) formation by generating 3' single-stranded overhang at the leading end telomeres: T loops have been proposed to protect chromosome ends from degradation and repair (PubMed:20655466). Required both to recruit DCLRE1B/Apollo to telomeres and activate the exonuclease activity of DCLRE1B/Apollo (PubMed:20655466, PubMed:28216226). Preferentially binds to positive supercoiled DNA (PubMed:15608617, PubMed:20655466). Together with DCLRE1B/Apollo, required to control the amount of DNA topoisomerase (TOP1, TOP2A and TOP2B) needed for telomere replication during fork passage and prevent aberrant telomere topology (PubMed:20655466). Recruits TERF2IP/RAP1 to telomeres, thereby participating in to repressing homology-directed repair (HDR), which can affect telomere length (By similarity).
