UniprotID	P07360
Accession	P07360;Q14CT8;Q14CU0;Q5SQ07
EntryName	CO8G_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complement component C8 gamma chain
GeneName	C8G
Length	202
Function	C8 is a constituent of the membrane attack complex. C8 binds to the C5B-7 complex, forming the C5B-8 complex. C5-B8 binds C9 and acts as a catalyst in the polymerization of C9. The gamma subunit seems to be able to bind retinol.
