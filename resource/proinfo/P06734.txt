UniprotID	P06734
Accession	P06734
EntryName	FCER2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Low affinity immunoglobulin epsilon Fc receptor (BLAST-2) (C-type lectin domain family 4 member J) (Fc-epsilon-RII) (Immunoglobulin E-binding factor) (Lymphocyte IgE receptor) (CD antigen CD23) [Cleaved into: Low affinity immunoglobulin epsilon Fc receptor membrane-bound form; Low affinity immunoglobulin epsilon Fc receptor soluble form]
GeneName	FCER2 CD23A CLEC4J FCE2 IGEBF
Length	321
Function	Low-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) and CR2/CD21. Has essential roles in the regulation of IgE production and in the differentiation of B cells. On B cells, initiates IgE-dependent antigen uptake and presentation to T cells (PubMed:2167225). On macrophages, upon IgE binding and antigen cross-linking induces intracellular killing of parasites through activation of L-Arginine-nitric oxide pathway (PubMed:7544003).
