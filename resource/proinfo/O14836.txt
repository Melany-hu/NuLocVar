UniprotID	O14836
Accession	O14836;B2R8B0;B7Z6V8;Q32LX4;Q7Z6F5
EntryName	TR13B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13B (Transmembrane activator and CAML interactor) (CD antigen CD267)
GeneName	TNFRSF13B TACI
Length	293
Function	Receptor for TNFSF13/APRIL and TNFSF13B/TALL1/BAFF/BLYS that binds both ligands with similar high affinity. Mediates calcineurin-dependent activation of NF-AT, as well as activation of NF-kappa-B and AP-1. Involved in the stimulation of B- and T-cell function and the regulation of humoral immunity.
