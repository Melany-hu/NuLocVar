UniprotID	Q9UL16
Accession	Q9UL16;C9JH28;Q05BA3;Q5VU18
EntryName	CFA45_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 45 (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 19) (Nasopharyngeal epithelium-specific protein 1)
GeneName	CFAP45 CCDC19 NESG1
Length	551
Function	Microtubule inner protein (MIP) part of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in cilia axoneme, which is required for motile cilia beating (PubMed:36191189). It is an AMP-binding protein that may facilitate dynein ATPase-dependent ciliary and flagellar beating via adenine nucleotide homeostasis. May function as a donor of AMP to AK8 and hence promote ADP production (PubMed:33139725).
