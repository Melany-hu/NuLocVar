UniprotID	P27824
Accession	P27824;B2R5V8;B4DGP8;B4E2T8;D3DWQ3;D6R9K3
EntryName	CALX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calnexin (IP90) (Major histocompatibility complex class I antigen-binding protein p88) (p90)
GeneName	CANX
Length	592
Function	Calcium-binding protein that interacts with newly synthesized monoglucosylated glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. It may act in assisting protein assembly and/or in the retention within the ER of unassembled protein subunits. It seems to play a major role in the quality control apparatus of the ER by the retention of incorrectly folded proteins. Associated with partial T-cell antigen receptor complexes that escape the ER of immature thymocytes, it may function as a signaling complex regulating thymocyte maturation. Additionally it may play a role in receptor-mediated endocytosis at the synapse.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Mitochondrion membrane; Melanosome membrane
