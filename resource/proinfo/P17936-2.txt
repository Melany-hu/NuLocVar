UniprotID	P17936-2
Accession	P17936;A4D2F5;D3DVM0;Q2V509;Q6P1M6;Q9UCL4
EntryName	IBP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IBP-3) (IGF-binding protein 3) (IGFBP-3)
GeneName	IGFBP3 IBP3
Length	297
Function	Multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in regulating the availability of IGFs such as IGF1 and IGF2 to their receptors and thereby regulates IGF-mediated cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in a cell-type specific manner (PubMed:10874028, PubMed:19556345). Also exhibits IGF-independent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects mediated by its receptor TMEM219/IGFBP-3R (PubMed:20353938). Inhibits the positive effect of humanin on insulin sensitivity (PubMed:19623253). Promotes testicular germ cell apoptosis (PubMed:19952275). Acts via LRP-1/alpha2M receptor, also known as TGF-beta type V receptor, to mediate cell growth inhibition independent of IGF1 (PubMed:9252371). Mechanistically, induces serine-specific dephosphorylation of IRS1 or IRS2 upon ligation to its receptor, leading to the inhibitory cascade (PubMed:15371331). In the nucleus, interacts with transcription factors such as retinoid X receptor-alpha/RXRA to regulate transcriptional signaling and apoptosis (PubMed:10874028).
