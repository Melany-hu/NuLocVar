UniprotID	Q8WVZ1
Accession	Q8WVZ1;A0A0B4J1W2;A8MSY6;B3KVI1
EntryName	ZDH19_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC19 (EC 2.3.1.225) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 19) (DHHC-19)
GeneName	ZDHHC19
Length	309
Function	Palmitoyltransferase that mediates palmitoylation oproteins, such as RRAS and SQSTM1 (PubMed:20074548, PubMed:37802024). Catalyzes palmitoylation of RRAS, leading to increased cell viability (PubMed:20074548). Acts as a positive regulator of autophagy by mediating palmitoylation of SQSTM1, promoting affinity between SQSTM1 and ATG8 proteins and recruitment of ubiquitinated cargo proteins to autophagosomes (PubMed:37802024).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region
