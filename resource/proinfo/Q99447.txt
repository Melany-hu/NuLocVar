EntryName	PCY2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.14) (CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase) (Phosphorylethanolamine transferase)
GeneName	PCYT2
Length	389
Function	Ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase that catalyzes the second step in the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) from ethanolamine via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway (PubMed:31637422, PubMed:9083101). Phosphatidylethanolamine is a dominant inner-leaflet phospholipid in cell membranes, where it plays a role in membrane function by structurally stabilizing membrane-anchored proteins, and participates in important cellular processes such as cell division, cell fusion, blood coagulation, and apoptosis (PubMed:9083101).
