UniprotID	Q96LB8
Accession	Q96LB8;A8K838;Q3B822;Q3B823;Q5SY63;Q5SY64;Q9HD75
EntryName	PGRP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidoglycan recognition protein 4 (Peptidoglycan recognition protein I-beta) (PGLYRPIbeta) (PGRP-I-beta) (Peptidoglycan recognition protein intermediate beta)
GeneName	PGLYRP4 PGRPIB SBBI67
Length	373
Function	Pattern receptor that binds to murein peptidoglycans (PGN) of Gram-positive bacteria. Has bactericidal activity towards Gram-positive bacteria. May kill Gram-positive bacteria by interfering with peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Also binds to Gram-negative bacteria, and has bacteriostatic activity towards Gram-negative bacteria. Plays a role in innate immunity.
