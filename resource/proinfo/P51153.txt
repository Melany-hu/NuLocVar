UniprotID	P51153
Accession	P51153;A8K6B5;D3DV67;Q5U0A6;Q6GPG6;Q96GU4
EntryName	RAB13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-13 (EC 3.6.5.2) (Cell growth-inhibiting gene 4 protein)
GeneName	RAB13 GIG4
Length	203
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion. That Rab is involved in endocytic recycling and regulates the transport to the plasma membrane of transmembrane proteins like the tight junction protein OCLN/occludin. Thereby, it regulates the assembly and the activity of tight junctions. Moreover, it may also regulate tight junction assembly by activating the PKA signaling pathway and by reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton through the activation of the downstream effectors PRKACA and MICALL2 respectively. Through its role in tight junction assembly, may play a role in the establishment of Sertoli cell barrier. Plays also a role in angiogenesis through regulation of endothelial cells chemotaxis. Also involved in neurite outgrowth. Has also been proposed to play a role in post-Golgi membrane trafficking from the TGN to the recycling endosome. Finally, it has been involved in insulin-induced transport to the plasma membrane of the glucose transporter GLUT4 and therefore may play a role in glucose homeostasis.
