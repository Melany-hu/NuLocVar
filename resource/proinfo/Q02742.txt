EntryName	GCNT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-1,3-galactosyl-O-glycosyl-glycoprotein beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.102) (Core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase) (C2GlcNAcT) (Core 2-branching enzyme) (Core2-GlcNAc-transferase) (C2GNT) (Core 2 GNT) (Leukocyte type core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase) (C2GnT-L)
GeneName	GCNT1 NACGT2
Length	428
Function	Glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety in beta1-6 linkage from UDP-GlcNAc onto mucin-type core 1 O-glycan to form the branched mucin-type core 2 O-glycan (PubMed:1329093, PubMed:23027862). The catalysis is metal ion-independent and occurs with inversion of the anomeric configuration of sugar donor (By similarity). Selectively involved in synthesis of mucin-type core 2 O-glycans that serve as scaffolds for the display of selectin ligand sialyl Lewis X epitope by myeloid cells, with an impact on homeostasis and recruitment to inflammatory sites (By similarity). Can also act on glycolipid substrates. Transfers GlcNAc moiety to GalGb4Cer globosides in a reaction step to the synthesis of stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA-1) determinant (By similarity). Can use Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha1- and Galbeta1-3GalNAcbeta1- oligosaccharide derivatives as acceptor substrates (By similarity).
