UniprotID	A8MWX3
Accession	A8MWX3
EntryName	WASH4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Putative WAS protein family homolog 4 (Protein FAM39CP)
GeneName	WASH4P FAM39CP
Length	477
Function	May act as a nucleation-promoting factor at the surface of endosomes, where it recruits and activates the Arp2/3 complex to induce actin polymerization, playing a key role in the fission of tubules that serve as transport intermediates during endosome sorting.
