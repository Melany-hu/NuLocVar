EntryName	RS6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein eS6 (40S ribosomal protein S6) (Phosphoprotein NP33)
GeneName	RPS6 OK/SW-cl.2
Length	249
Function	Component of the 40S small ribosomal subunit (PubMed:23636399, PubMed:8706699). Plays an important role in controlling cell growth and proliferation through the selective translation of particular classes of mRNA (PubMed:17220279). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
