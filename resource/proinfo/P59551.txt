UniprotID	P59551
Accession	P59551;A4D2G8;Q645W8;Q7RTR7
EntryName	T2R60_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 60 (T2R60) (Taste receptor type 2 member 56) (T2R56)
GeneName	TAS2R60
Length	318
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5 (By similarity).
