UniprotID	Q9BWH2
Accession	Q9BWH2;B2R7W5;D3DWY5;Q8NHX8;Q9H2I6
EntryName	FUND2_HUMAN
ProteinName	FUN14 domain-containing protein 2 (Cervical cancer proto-oncogene 3 protein) (HCC-3) (Hepatitis C virus core-binding protein 6)
GeneName	FUNDC2 HCBP6 DC44 HCC3 PD03104
Length	189
Function	Binds directly and specifically 1,2-Diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-myo-inositol-3',4',5'-bisphosphate) (PIP3) leading to the recruitment of PIP3 to mitochondria and may play a role in the regulation of the platelet activation via AKT/GSK3B/cGMP signaling pathways (PubMed:29786068). May act as transcription factor that regulates SREBP1 (isoform SREBP-1C) expression in order to modulate triglyceride (TG) homeostasis in hepatocytes (PubMed:25855506, PubMed:29187281).
