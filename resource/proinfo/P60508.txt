UniprotID	P60508
Accession	P60508
EntryName	SYCY2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Syncytin-2 (Endogenous retrovirus group FRD member 1) (Envelope polyprotein) (HERV-FRD) (HERV-FRD_6p24.1 provirus ancestral Env polyprotein) [Cleaved into: Surface protein (SU); Transmembrane protein (TM)]
GeneName	ERVFRD-1 ERVFRDE1 UNQ6191/PRO20218
Length	538
Function	This endogenous retroviral envelope protein has retained its original fusogenic properties and participates in trophoblast fusion and the formation of a syncytium during placenta morphogenesis. The interaction with MFSD2A is apparently important for this process (PubMed:18988732).
