EntryName	GNA11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-11 (G alpha-11) (G-protein subunit alpha-11) (EC 3.6.5.-) (Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(y) subunit alpha)
GeneName	GNA11 GA11
Length	359
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in numerous signaling cascades (PubMed:31073061). The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (PubMed:31073061). Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding (PubMed:31073061). The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal (PubMed:31073061). Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numerous regulatory proteins (PubMed:31073061). Signaling is mediated via phospholipase C-beta-dependent inositol lipid hydrolysis for signal propagation: activates phospholipase C-beta: following GPCR activation, GNA11 activates PLC-beta (PLCB1, PLCB2, PLCB3 or PLCB4), leading to production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (PubMed:31073061). Transduces FFAR4 signaling in response to long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) (PubMed:27852822). Together with GNAQ, required for heart development (By similarity). In the respiratory epithelium, transmits OXGR1-dependent signals that lead to downstream intracellular Ca(2+) release and mucocilliary clearance of airborne pathogens.
