Function	Component of the deuterosome, a structure that promotes de novo centriole amplification in multiciliated cells that can generate more than 100 centrioles. Deuterosome-mediated centriole amplification occurs in terminally differentiated multiciliated cells (G1/0) and not in S phase. Essential for centriole amplification and is required for CEP152 localization to the deuterosome.
