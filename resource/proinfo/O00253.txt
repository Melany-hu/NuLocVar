UniprotID	O00253
Accession	O00253;O15459;Q2TBD9
EntryName	AGRP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Agouti-related protein
GeneName	AGRP AGRT ART
Length	132
Function	Plays a role in weight homeostasis. Involved in the control of feeding behavior through the central melanocortin system. Acts as alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone antagonist by inhibiting cAMP production mediated by stimulation of melanocortin receptors within the hypothalamus and adrenal gland. Has very low activity with MC5R (By similarity). Is an inverse agonist for MC3R and MC4R being able to suppress their constitutive activity. It promotes MC3R and MC4R endocytosis in an arrestin-dependent manner.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Golgi apparatus lumen
