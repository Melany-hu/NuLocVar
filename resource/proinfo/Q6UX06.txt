UniprotID	Q6UX06
Accession	Q6UX06;O95362;Q5VWG0;Q86T22
EntryName	OLFM4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Olfactomedin-4 (OLM4) (Antiapoptotic protein GW112) (G-CSF-stimulated clone 1 protein) (hGC-1) (hOLfD)
GeneName	OLFM4 GW112 UNQ362/PRO698
Length	510
Function	May promote proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells by favoring the transition from the S to G2/M phase. In myeloid leukemic cell lines, inhibits cell growth and induces cell differentiation and apoptosis. May play a role in the inhibition of EIF4EBP1 phosphorylation/deactivation. Facilitates cell adhesion, most probably through interaction with cell surface lectins and cadherin.
