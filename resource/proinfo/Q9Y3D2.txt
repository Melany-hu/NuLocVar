UniprotID	Q9Y3D2
Accession	Q9Y3D2;Q17R44;Q4G1C7;Q9Y5W6
EntryName	MSRB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase B2, mitochondrial (MsrB2) (EC 1.8.4.12) (EC 1.8.4.14)
GeneName	MSRB2 CBS-1 MSRB CGI-131
Length	182
Function	Methionine-sulfoxide reductase that specifically reduces methionine (R)-sulfoxide back to methionine. While in many cases, methionine oxidation is the result of random oxidation following oxidative stress, methionine oxidation is also a post-translational modification that takes place on specific residue. Upon oxidative stress, may play a role in the preservation of mitochondrial integrity by decreasing the intracellular reactive oxygen species build-up through its scavenging role, hence contributing to cell survival and protein maintenance.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
