UniprotID	Q9UJ96
Accession	Q9UJ96
EntryName	KCNG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Voltage-gated potassium channel regulatory subunit KCNG2 (Cardiac potassium channel subunit) (Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily G member 2) (Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv6.2)
GeneName	KCNG2 KCNF2
Length	466
Function	Regulatory alpha-subunit of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel which, when coassembled with KCNB1, can modulate the kinetics and conductance-voltage relationship (PubMed:10551266). Modulates channel activity by shifting the threshold and the half-maximal activation to more negative values (Probable). Potassium channel subunit that does not form functional channels by itself (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
