UniprotID	Q92837
Accession	Q92837;Q5JTI1;Q8NE74;Q8TDW9
EntryName	FRAT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proto-oncogene FRAT1 (Frequently rearranged in advanced T-cell lymphomas 1) (FRAT-1)
GeneName	FRAT1
Length	279
Function	Positively regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by stabilizing beta-catenin through the association with GSK-3. May play a role in tumor progression and collaborate with PIM1 and MYC in lymphomagenesis.
