ProteinName	SHC-transforming protein 1 (SHC-transforming protein 3) (SHC-transforming protein A) (Src homology 2 domain-containing-transforming protein C1) (SH2 domain protein C1)

Length	473
Function	Signaling adapter that couples activated growth factor receptors to signaling pathways. Participates in a signaling cascade initiated by activated KIT and KITLG/SCF. Isoform p46Shc and isoform p52Shc, once phosphorylated, couple activated receptor tyrosine kinases to Ras via the recruitment of the GRB2/SOS complex and are implicated in the cytoplasmic propagation of mitogenic signals. Isoform p46Shc and isoform p52Shc may thus function as initiators of the Ras signaling cascade in various non-neuronal systems. Isoform p66Shc does not mediate Ras activation, but is involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate the cellular response to oxidative stress and life span. Isoform p66Shc acts as a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53 and is indispensable for the ability of stress-activated p53 to induce elevation of intracellular oxidants, cytochrome c release and apoptosis. The expression of isoform p66Shc has been correlated with life span (By similarity). Participates in signaling downstream of the angiopoietin receptor TEK/TIE2, and plays a role in the regulation of endothelial cell migration and sprouting angiogenesis.
