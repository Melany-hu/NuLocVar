Accession	P62244;P39027;P39031;Q3MHD9;Q8C023;Q9BV24
EntryName	RS15A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein uS8 (40S ribosomal protein S15a)
GeneName	RPS15A OK/SW-cl.82
Length	130
Function	Component of the small ribosomal subunit (PubMed:23636399). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797). Required for proper erythropoiesis (PubMed:27909223).
