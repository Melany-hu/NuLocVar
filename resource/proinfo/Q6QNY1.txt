EntryName	BL1S2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 subunit 2 (BLOC-1 subunit 2) (Centrosome-associated protein)
GeneName	BLOC1S2 BLOS2 CEAP
Length	142
Function	Component of the BLOC-1 complex, a complex that is required for normal biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LRO), such as platelet dense granules and melanosomes (PubMed:15102850, PubMed:17182842). In concert with the AP-3 complex, the BLOC-1 complex is required to target membrane protein cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals. The BLOC-1 complex, in association with SNARE proteins, is also proposed to be involved in neurite extension (By similarity). As part of the BORC complex may play a role in lysosomes movement and localization at the cell periphery. Associated with the cytosolic face of lysosomes, the BORC complex may recruit ARL8B and couple lysosomes to microtubule plus-end-directed kinesin motor (PubMed:25898167). May play a role in cell proliferation (PubMed:15381421).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome; Lysosome membrane
