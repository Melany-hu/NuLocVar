UniprotID	Q9H3Q3
Accession	Q9H3Q3;Q17RK0;Q57Z52
EntryName	G3ST2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase 2 (Gal3ST-2) (EC 2.8.2.-) (Beta-galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase 2) (Gal-beta-1, 3-GalNAc 3'-sulfotransferase 2) (Glycoprotein beta-Gal 3'-sulfotransferase 2)
GeneName	GAL3ST2 GP3ST
Length	398
Function	Transfers a sulfate group to the hydroxyl group at C3 of non-reducing beta-galactosyl residues. Acts both on type 1 (Gal-beta-1,3-GlcNAc) and type 2 (Gal-beta-1,4-GlcNAc) chains with similar efficiency.
