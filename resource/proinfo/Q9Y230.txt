EntryName	RUVB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	RuvB-like 2 (EC 3.6.4.12) (48 kDa TATA box-binding protein-interacting protein) (48 kDa TBP-interacting protein) (51 kDa erythrocyte cytosolic protein) (ECP-51) (INO80 complex subunit J) (Repressing pontin 52) (Reptin 52) (TIP49b) (TIP60-associated protein 54-beta) (TAP54-beta)
GeneName	RUVBL2 INO80J TIP48 TIP49B CGI-46
Length	463
Function	Possesses single-stranded DNA-stimulated ATPase and ATP-dependent DNA helicase (5' to 3') activity; hexamerization is thought to be critical for ATP hydrolysis and adjacent subunits in the ring-like structure contribute to the ATPase activity (PubMed:10428817, PubMed:17157868, PubMed:33205750). Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex which is involved in transcriptional activation of select genes principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histones H4 and H2A (PubMed:14966270). This modification may both alter nucleosome -DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription (PubMed:14966270). This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence, apoptosis, and DNA repair (PubMed:14966270). The NuA4 complex ATPase and helicase activities seem to be, at least in part, contributed by the association of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 with EP400 (PubMed:14966270). NuA4 may also play a direct role in DNA repair when recruited to sites of DNA damage (PubMed:14966270). Component of a SWR1-like complex that specifically mediates the removal of histone H2A.Z/H2AZ1 from the nucleosome (PubMed:24463511). Proposed core component of the chromatin remodeling INO80 complex which exhibits DNA- and nucleosome-activated ATPase activity and catalyzes ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding (PubMed:16230350, PubMed:21303910). Plays an essential role in oncogenic transformation by MYC and also modulates transcriptional activation by the LEF1/TCF1-CTNNB1 complex (PubMed:10882073, PubMed:16014379). May also inhibit the transcriptional activity of ATF2 (PubMed:11713276). Involved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway where it negatively regulates expression of ER stress response genes (PubMed:25652260). May play a role in regulating the composition of the U5 snRNP complex (PubMed:28561026).
