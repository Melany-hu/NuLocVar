EntryName	DDX56_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX56 (EC 3.6.4.13) (ATP-dependent 61 kDa nucleolar RNA helicase) (DEAD box protein 21) (DEAD box protein 56)
GeneName	DDX56 DDX21 NOH61
Length	547
Function	Nucleolar RNA helicase that plays a role in various biological processes including innate immunity, ribosome biogenesis or nucleolus organization (PubMed:31340999, PubMed:33789112). Plays an essential role in maintaining nucleolar integrity in planarian stem cells (PubMed:33789112). Maintains embryonic stem cells proliferation by conventional regulation of ribosome assembly and interaction with OCT4 and POU5F1 complex (By similarity). Regulates antiviral innate immunity by inhibiting the virus-triggered signaling nuclear translocation of IRF3 (PubMed:31340999). Mechanistically, acts by disrupting the interaction between IRF3 and importin IPO5 (PubMed:31340999). May play a role in later stages of the processing of the pre-ribosomal particles leading to mature 60S ribosomal subunits. Has intrinsic ATPase activity.
