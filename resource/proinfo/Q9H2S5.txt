EntryName	RNF39_HUMAN
ProteinName	RING finger protein 39 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Protein HZFw)
GeneName	RNF39 HZFW
Length	420
Function	Plays an inhibitory role in anti-RNA viral innate immunity by targeting the adapter DDX3X and promoting its 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:33674311). Alternatively, enhances the cGAS-STING pathway activation by promoting 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of STING1, facilitating the STING1-TBK1 complex formation and STING1 activation (PubMed:39255680).
