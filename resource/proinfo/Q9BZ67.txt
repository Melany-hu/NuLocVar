EntryName	FRMD8_HUMAN
ProteinName	FERM domain-containing protein 8 (Band4.1 inhibitor LRP interactor) (Bili) (iRhom tail-associated protein) (iTAP)
GeneName	FRMD8 FKSG44
Length	464
Function	Promotes the cell surface stability of iRhom1/RHBDF1 and iRhom2/RHBDF2 and prevents their degradation via the endolysosomal pathway. By acting on iRhoms, involved in ADAM17-mediated shedding of TNF, amphiregulin/AREG, HBEGF and TGFA from the cell surface (PubMed:29897333, PubMed:29897336). Negatively regulates Wnt signaling, possibly by antagonizing the recruitment of AXIN1 to LRP6 (PubMed:19572019).
