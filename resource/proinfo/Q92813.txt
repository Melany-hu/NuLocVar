EntryName	IOD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Type II iodothyronine deiodinase (EC 1.21.99.4) (5DII) (DIOII) (Type 2 DI) (Type-II 5'-deiodinase)
GeneName	DIO2 ITDI2 TXDI2
Length	273
Function	Plays a crucial role in the metabolism of thyroid hormones (TH) and has specific roles in TH activation and inactivation by deiodination. Catalyzes the conversion of T4 (L-thyroxine/3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine) to T3 (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) via outer-ring deiodination (ORD) (PubMed:12586771, PubMed:11108274, PubMed:10403186). Catalyzes the conversion of rT3 (3,3',5'-triiodothyronine) to T2 (3,3'-diiodothyronine) via ORD (PubMed:11108274). Catalyzes the conversion 3',5'-T2 (3,5-diiodothyronine) to 3-T1 (3-monoiodothyronine) via ORD (PubMed:18821722).
