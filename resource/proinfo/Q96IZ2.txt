UniprotID	Q96IZ2
Accession	Q96IZ2;B2R7T9;B4DV39;Q5THW1
EntryName	ADTRP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Androgen-dependent TFPI-regulating protein (Fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids hydrolase ADTRP) (FAHFA hydrolase ADTRP) (EC 3.1.-.-)
GeneName	ADTRP C6orf105
Length	230
Function	Hydrolyzes bioactive fatty-acid esters of hydroxy-fatty acids (FAHFAs), but not other major classes of lipids (PubMed:27018888). Show a preference for FAHFAs with branching distal from the carboxylate head group of the lipids (PubMed:27018888). Regulates the expression and the cell-associated anticoagulant activity of the inhibitor TFPI in endothelial cells (in vitro) (PubMed:21868574).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
