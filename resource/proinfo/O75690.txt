UniprotID	O75690
Accession	O75690;Q6L8G7;Q6UTX6
EntryName	KRA58_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 5-8 (Keratin, ultra high-sulfur matrix protein B) (Keratin-associated protein 5.8) (UHS keratin B) (UHS KerB) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 5.8)
GeneName	KRTAP5-8 KAP5.8 KRTAP5.8 UHSKB
Length	187
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated protein (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
