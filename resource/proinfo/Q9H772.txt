UniprotID	Q9H772
Accession	Q9H772;Q86UD9
EntryName	GREM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gremlin-2 (Cysteine knot superfamily 1, BMP antagonist 2) (DAN domain family member 3) (Protein related to DAN and cerberus)
GeneName	GREM2 CKTSF1B2 DAND3 PRDC
Length	168
Function	Cytokine that inhibits the activity of BMP2 and BMP4 in a dose-dependent manner, and thereby modulates signaling by BMP family members. Contributes to the regulation of embryonic morphogenesis via BMP family members. Antagonizes BMP4-induced suppression of progesterone production in granulosa cells.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
