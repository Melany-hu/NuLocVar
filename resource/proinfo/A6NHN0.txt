UniprotID	A6NHN0
Accession	A6NHN0
EntryName	OTOL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Otolin-1
GeneName	OTOL1
Length	477
Function	Collagen-like protein specifically expressed in the inner ear, which provides an organic scaffold for otoconia, a calcium carbonate structure in the saccule and utricle of the ear. Acts as a scaffold for biomineralization: sequesters calcium and forms interconnecting fibrils between otoconia that are incorporated into the calcium crystal structure. Together with OC90, modulates calcite crystal morphology and growth kinetics.
