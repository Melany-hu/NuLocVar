EntryName	RAB10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-10 (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB10
Length	200
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes (PubMed:21248164). Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different set of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (PubMed:21248164). That Rab is mainly involved in the biosynthetic transport of proteins from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (PubMed:21248164). Regulates, for instance, SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter-enriched vesicles delivery to the plasma membrane (By similarity). In parallel, it regulates the transport of TLR4, a toll-like receptor to the plasma membrane and therefore may be important for innate immune response (By similarity). Also plays a specific role in asymmetric protein transport to the plasma membrane (PubMed:16641372). In neurons, it is involved in axonogenesis through regulation of vesicular membrane trafficking toward the axonal plasma membrane (By similarity). In epithelial cells, it regulates transport from the Golgi to the basolateral membrane (PubMed:16641372). May play a role in the basolateral recycling pathway and in phagosome maturation (By similarity). May play a role in endoplasmic reticulum dynamics and morphology controlling tubulation along microtubules and tubules fusion (PubMed:23263280). Together with LRRK2, RAB8A, and RILPL1, it regulates ciliogenesis (PubMed:30398148). When phosphorylated by LRRK2 on Thr-73, binds RILPL1 and inhibits ciliogenesis (PubMed:30398148). Participates in the export of a subset of neosynthesized proteins through a Rab8-Rab10-Rab11-dependent endososomal export route (PubMed:32344433). Targeted to and stabilized on stressed lysosomes through LRRK2 phosphorylation where it promotes the extracellular release of lysosomal content through EHBP1 and EHNP1L1 effector proteins (PubMed:30209220).
