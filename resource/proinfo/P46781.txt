UniprotID	P46781
Accession	P46781;A9C4C1;Q4QRK7;Q9BVZ0
EntryName	RS9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein uS4 (40S ribosomal protein S9)
GeneName	RPS9
Length	194
Function	Component of the small ribosomal subunit (PubMed:23636399). The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:23636399). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
