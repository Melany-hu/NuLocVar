UniprotID	Q9NWX5
Accession	Q9NWX5;Q5SZB7;Q9BV15
EntryName	ASB6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 6 (ASB-6)
GeneName	ASB6
Length	421
Function	Probable substrate-recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin-Cullin-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. May play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and autophagy by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of SQSTM1 (PubMed:34164402).
