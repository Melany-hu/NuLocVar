UniprotID	Q8TED4
Accession	Q8TED4;A8K2P9;Q6P599;Q7Z7P8;Q8TEM2
EntryName	G6PT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucose-6-phosphate exchanger SLC37A2 (Solute carrier family 37 member 2)
GeneName	SLC37A2
Length	501
Function	Inorganic phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate antiporter. May transport cytoplasmic glucose-6-phosphate into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and translocate inorganic phosphate into the opposite direction. Independent of a lumenal glucose-6-phosphatase. May not play a role in homeostatic regulation of blood glucose levels.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
