UniprotID	Q8WWF5
Accession	Q8WWF5;A8K886;O75866
EntryName	ZNRF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ZNRF4 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Nixin) (RING finger protein 204) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase ZNRF4) (Zinc/RING finger protein 4)
GeneName	ZNRF4 RNF204
Length	429
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that acts as a negative regulator of NOD2 signaling by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of RIPK2 (PubMed:28656966). Also catalyzes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CANX within the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:21205830). Could have a role in spermatogenesis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
