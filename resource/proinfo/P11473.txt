ProteinName	Vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor) (Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 1)
GeneName	VDR NR1I1
Length	427
Function	Nuclear receptor for calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3 which mediates the action of this vitamin on cells (PubMed:10678179, PubMed:15728261, PubMed:16913708, PubMed:28698609, PubMed:37478846). Enters the nucleus upon vitamin D3 binding where it forms heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor/RXR (PubMed:28698609). The VDR-RXR heterodimers bind to specific response elements on DNA and activate the transcription of vitamin D3-responsive target genes (PubMed:28698609). Plays a central role in calcium homeostasis (By similarity). Also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid (LCA) and its metabolites (PubMed:12016314, PubMed:32354638).
