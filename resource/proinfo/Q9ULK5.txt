UniprotID	Q9ULK5
Accession	Q9ULK5;D3DVE9;Q5T212
EntryName	VANG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vang-like protein 2 (Loop-tail protein 1 homolog) (Strabismus 1) (Van Gogh-like protein 2)
GeneName	VANGL2 KIAA1215 STB1
Length	521
Function	Involved in the control of early morphogenesis and patterning of both axial midline structures and the development of neural plate. Plays a role in the regulation of planar cell polarity, particularly in the orientation of stereociliary bundles in the cochlea. Required for polarization and movement of myocardializing cells in the outflow tract and seems to act via RHOA signaling to regulate this process. Required for cell surface localization of FZD3 and FZD6 in the inner ear (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
