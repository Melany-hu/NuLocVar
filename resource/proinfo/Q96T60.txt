UniprotID	Q96T60
Accession	Q96T60;Q9BUL2;Q9P1V2;Q9UKU8;Q9UNF8;Q9UNI0
EntryName	PNKP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bifunctional polynucleotide phosphatase/kinase (DNA 5'-kinase/3'-phosphatase) (Polynucleotide kinase-3'-phosphatase) [Includes: Polynucleotide 3'-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.32) (2'(3')-polynucleotidase); Polynucleotide 5'-hydroxyl-kinase (EC 2.7.1.78)]
GeneName	PNKP
Length	521
Function	Plays a key role in the repair of DNA damage, functioning as part of both the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and base excision repair (BER) pathways (PubMed:10446192, PubMed:10446193, PubMed:15385968, PubMed:20852255, PubMed:28453785). Through its two catalytic activities, PNK ensures that DNA termini are compatible with extension and ligation by either removing 3'-phosphates from, or by phosphorylating 5'-hydroxyl groups on, the ribose sugar of the DNA backbone (PubMed:10446192, PubMed:10446193).
