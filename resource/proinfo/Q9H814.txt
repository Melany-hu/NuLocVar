EntryName	PHAX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphorylated adapter RNA export protein (RNA U small nuclear RNA export adapter protein)
GeneName	PHAX RNUXA
Length	394
Function	A phosphoprotein adapter involved in the XPO1-mediated U snRNA export from the nucleus (PubMed:39011894). Bridge components required for U snRNA export, the cap binding complex (CBC)-bound snRNA on the one hand and the GTPase Ran in its active GTP-bound form together with the export receptor XPO1 on the other. Its phosphorylation in the nucleus is required for U snRNA export complex assembly and export, while its dephosphorylation in the cytoplasm causes export complex disassembly. It is recycled back to the nucleus via the importin alpha/beta heterodimeric import receptor. The directionality of nuclear export is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Its compartmentalized phosphorylation cycle may also contribute to the directionality of export. Binds strongly to m7G-capped U1 and U5 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in a sequence-unspecific manner and phosphorylation-independent manner (By similarity). Also plays a role in the biogenesis of U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). Involved in the U3 snoRNA transport from nucleoplasm to Cajal bodies. Binds strongly to m7G-capped U3, U8 and U13 precursor snoRNAs and weakly to trimethylated (TMG)-capped U3, U8 and U13 snoRNAs. Also binds to telomerase RNA.
