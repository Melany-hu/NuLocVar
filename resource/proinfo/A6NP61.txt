UniprotID	A6NP61
Accession	A6NP61;B2RV03;B7ZBU2
EntryName	ZAR1L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein ZAR1-like (Zygote arrest protein 1-like)
GeneName	ZAR1L
Length	321
Function	mRNA-binding protein required for maternal mRNA storage, translation and degradation during oocyte maturation (By similarity). Probably promotes formation of some phase-separated membraneless compartment that stores maternal mRNAs in oocytes: acts by undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation upon binding to maternal mRNAs (By similarity). Binds to the 3'-UTR of maternal mRNAs, inhibiting their translation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granule
