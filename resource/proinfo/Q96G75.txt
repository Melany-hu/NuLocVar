Accession	Q96G75;Q1HE27;Q6UVY7;Q9H6F6
EntryName	RMD5B_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein transferase RMND5B (EC 2.3.2.27) (Protein RMD5 homolog B)
GeneName	RMND5B UNQ2508/PRO5996
Length	393
Function	Core component of the CTLH E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex that selectively accepts ubiquitin from UBE2H and mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the transcription factor HBP1. MAEA and RMND5A are both required for catalytic activity of the CTLH E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (PubMed:29911972). Catalytic activity of the complex is required for normal cell proliferation (PubMed:29911972). The CTLH E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex is not required for the degradation of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, such as FBP1 (PubMed:29911972).
