UniprotID	Q6QHK4
Accession	Q6QHK4
EntryName	FIGLA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Factor in the germline alpha (FIGalpha) (Class C basic helix-loop-helix protein 8) (bHLHc8) (Folliculogenesis-specific basic helix-loop-helix protein) (Transcription factor FIGa)
GeneName	FIGLA BHLHC8
Length	219
Function	Germline specific transcription factor implicated in postnatal oocyte-specific gene expression. Plays a key regulatory role in the expression of multiple oocyte-specific genes, including those that initiate folliculogenesis and those that encode the zona pellucida (ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3) required for fertilization and early embryonic survival. Essential for oocytes to survive and form primordial follicles. The persistence of FIGLA in adult females suggests that it may regulate additional pathways that are essential for normal ovarian development. Binds to the E-box (5'-CANNTG-3') of the ZPs (ZP1, ZP2, ZP3) promoters.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
