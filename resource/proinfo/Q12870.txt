UniprotID	Q12870
Accession	Q12870;Q9NQQ1
EntryName	TCF15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor 15 (TCF-15) (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 40) (bHLHa40) (Paraxis) (Protein bHLH-EC2)
GeneName	TCF15 BHLHA40 BHLHEC2
Length	199
Function	Early transcription factor that plays a key role in somitogenesis, paraxial mesoderm development and regulation of stem cell pluripotency. Essential for the mesenchymal to epithelial transition associated with somite formation. Required for somite morphogenesis, thereby regulating patterning of the axial skeleton and skeletal muscles. Required for proper localization of somite epithelium markers during the mesenchymal to epithelial transition. Also plays a key role in regulation of stem cell pluripotency. Promotes pluripotency exit of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by priming ESCs for differentiation. Acts as a key regulator of self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by mediating HSCs quiescence and long-term self-renewal. Together with MEOX2, regulates transcription in heart endothelial cells to regulate fatty acid transport across heart endothelial cells. Acts by forming a heterodimer with another helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, such as TCF3/E12, that binds DNA on E-box motifs (5'-CANNTG-3') and activates transcription of target genes.
