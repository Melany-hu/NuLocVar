EntryName	K1C17_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 17 (39.1) (Cytokeratin-17) (CK-17) (Keratin-17) (K17)
GeneName	KRT17
Length	432
Function	Type I keratin involved in the formation and maintenance of various skin appendages, specifically in determining shape and orientation of hair (By similarity). Required for the correct growth of hair follicles, in particular for the persistence of the anagen (growth) state (By similarity). Modulates the function of TNF-alpha in the specific context of hair cycling. Regulates protein synthesis and epithelial cell growth through binding to the adapter protein SFN and by stimulating Akt/mTOR pathway (By similarity). Involved in tissue repair. May be a marker of basal cell differentiation in complex epithelia and therefore indicative of a certain type of epithelial 'stem cells'. Acts as a promoter of epithelial proliferation by acting a regulator of immune response in skin: promotes Th1/Th17-dominated immune environment contributing to the development of basaloid skin tumors (By similarity). May act as an autoantigen in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis, with certain peptide regions being a major target for autoreactive T-cells and hence causing their proliferation.
