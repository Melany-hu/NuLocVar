UniprotID	Q9NQ31
Accession	Q9NQ31;Q8NBS2;Q8TAC6;Q8TAD3;Q8TAE0
EntryName	AKIP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	A-kinase-interacting protein 1 (Breast cancer-associated gene 3 protein) (PKA-interacting protein) (Proline-rich protein BCA3)
GeneName	AKIP1 BCA3 C11orf17
Length	210
Function	Enhances NF-kappa-B transcriptional activity by regulating the nuclear localization of the NF-kappa-B subunit RELA and promoting the phosphorylation of RELA by PRKACA. Regulates the effect of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase signaling pathway on the NF-kappa-B activation cascade.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
