UniprotID	Q92904
Accession	Q92904;O15396;Q5HYB4;Q92909
EntryName	DAZL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZ homolog) (DAZ-like autosomal) (Deleted in azoospermia-like 1) (SPGY-like-autosomal)
GeneName	DAZL DAZH DAZL1 DAZLA SPGYLA
Length	295
Function	RNA-binding protein, which is essential for gametogenesis in both males and females. Plays a central role during spermatogenesis. Acts by binding to the 3'-UTR of mRNA, specifically recognizing GUU triplets, and thereby regulating the translation of key transcripts (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus
