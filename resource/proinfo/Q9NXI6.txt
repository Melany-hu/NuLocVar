EntryName	RN186_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF186 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 186)
GeneName	RNF186
Length	227
Function	E3 ubiquitin protein ligase that is part of an apoptotic signaling pathway activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress (PubMed:23896122). Stimulates the expression of proteins specific of the unfolded protein response (UPR), ubiquitinates BNIP1 and regulates its localization to the mitochondrion and induces calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum that ultimately leads to cell apoptosis (PubMed:23896122). Plays a role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and clearance of enteric pathogens. Upon NOD2 stimulation, ubiquitinates the ER stress sensor activating transcription factor 6/ATF6 and promotes the unfolded protein response UPR (PubMed:34623328). Participates in basal level of autophagy maintenance by regulating the ubiquitination of EPHB2 and EPHB3. Upon stimulation by ligand EFNB1, ubiquitinates EPHB2 and further recruits MAP1LC3B for autophagy induction (PubMed:33280498). Controls nutrient sensing by ubiquitinating Sestrin-2/SESN2, which is an intracellular sensor of cytosolic leucine and inhibitor of mTORC1 activity (PubMed:31586034).
