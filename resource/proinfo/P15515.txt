UniprotID	P15515
Accession	P15515
EntryName	HIS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histatin-1 (Hst1) (Histidine-rich protein 1) (Post-PB protein) (PPB) [Cleaved into: His1-(31-57)-peptide (His1 31/57) (His1-(12-38)-peptide) (His1 12/38) (Histatin 2) (Hst2) (Histatin-2)]
GeneName	HTN1 HIS1
Length	57
Function	Histatins (Hsts) are cationic and histidine-rich secreted peptides mainly synthesized by saliva glands of humans and higher primates (PubMed:3286634, PubMed:3944083). Hsts are considered to be major precursors of the protective proteinaceous structure on tooth surfaces (enamel pellicle). Hsts can be divided into two major groups according to their biological functions: antimicrobial Hsts (e.g. Hst 5/HTN3) and cell-activating Hsts (e.g. Hst 1/HTN1 and Hst 2/HTN1) (PubMed:32225006). Hst 1/HTN1 and Hst 2/HTN1 act in different cell types (epithelium, fibroblasts and endothelium) in oral and non-oral mucosa (PubMed:25903106, PubMed:28542418, PubMed:28751526, PubMed:32225006).
