UniprotID	Q99972
Accession	Q99972;B2RD84;O00620;Q7Z6Q9
EntryName	MYOC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myocilin (Myocilin 55 kDa subunit) (Trabecular meshwork-induced glucocorticoid response protein) [Cleaved into: Myocilin, N-terminal fragment (Myocilin 20 kDa N-terminal fragment); Myocilin, C-terminal fragment (Myocilin 35 kDa N-terminal fragment)]
GeneName	MYOC GLC1A TIGR
Length	504
Function	Secreted glycoprotein regulating the activation of different signaling pathways in adjacent cells to control different processes including cell adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion, cytoskeleton organization and cell migration. Promotes substrate adhesion, spreading and formation of focal contacts. Negatively regulates cell-matrix adhesion and stress fiber assembly through Rho protein signal transduction. Modulates the organization of actin cytoskeleton by stimulating the formation of stress fibers through interactions with components of Wnt signaling pathways. Promotes cell migration through activation of PTK2 and the downstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling. Plays a role in bone formation and promotes osteoblast differentiation in a dose-dependent manner through mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Mediates myelination in the peripheral nervous system through ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling. Plays a role as a regulator of muscle hypertrophy through the components of dystrophin-associated protein complex. Involved in positive regulation of mitochondrial depolarization. Plays a role in neurite outgrowth. May participate in the obstruction of fluid outflow in the trabecular meshwork.
