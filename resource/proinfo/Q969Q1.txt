UniprotID	Q969Q1
Accession	Q969Q1;B4DN95;Q5T2I1;Q96BD3;Q96KD9;Q9BYV4
EntryName	TRI63_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM63 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Iris RING finger protein) (Muscle-specific RING finger protein 1) (MuRF-1) (MuRF1) (RING finger protein 28) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase TRIM63) (Striated muscle RING zinc finger protein) (Tripartite motif-containing protein 63)
GeneName	TRIM63 IRF MURF1 RNF28 SMRZ
Length	353
Function	E3 ubiquitin ligase. Mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of CKM, GMEB1 and HIBADH. Regulates the proteasomal degradation of muscle proteins under amino acid starvation, where muscle protein is catabolized to provide other organs with amino acids. Inhibits de novo skeletal muscle protein synthesis under amino acid starvation. Regulates proteasomal degradation of cardiac troponin I/TNNI3 and probably of other sarcomeric-associated proteins. May play a role in striated muscle atrophy and hypertrophy by regulating an anti-hypertrophic PKC-mediated signaling pathway. May regulate the organization of myofibrils through TTN in muscle cells.
