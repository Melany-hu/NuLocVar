EntryName	TEDC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tubulin epsilon and delta complex protein 1
GeneName	TEDC1 C14orf80
Length	495
Function	Acts as a positive regulator of ciliary hedgehog signaling. Required for centriole stability (By similarity). May play a role in counteracting perturbation of actin filaments, such as after treatment with the actin depolymerizing microbial metabolite Chivosazole F (PubMed:28796488).
