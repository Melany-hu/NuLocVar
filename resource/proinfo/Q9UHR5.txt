UniprotID	Q9UHR5
Accession	Q9UHR5;B3KML7;Q8N1R5;Q8TDR8;Q96D27
EntryName	S30BP_HUMAN
ProteinName	SAP30-binding protein (Transcriptional regulator protein HCNGP)
GeneName	SAP30BP HCNGP HTRG HTRP
Length	308
Function	Plays a role in transcriptional repression by promoting histone deacetylase activity, leading to deacetylation of histone H3 (PubMed:21221920). May be involved in the regulation of beta-2-microglobulin genes (By similarity).
