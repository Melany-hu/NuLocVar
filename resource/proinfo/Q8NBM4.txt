UniprotID	Q8NBM4
Accession	Q8NBM4;B3KNV7;Q0VAB5;Q5W0W6;Q5W0W9;Q6GQR2;Q6P4B0;Q8N2E8;Q96NW2
EntryName	UBAC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-associated domain-containing protein 2 (UBA domain-containing protein 2) (Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase-like protein 1)
GeneName	UBAC2 PHGDHL1 PSEC0110
Length	344
Function	Restricts trafficking of FAF2 from the endoplasmic reticulum to lipid droplets (PubMed:23297223). In association with LMBR1L and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase AMFR, negatively regulates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the lymphocytes by promoting the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of CTNNB1 and Wnt receptors FZD6 and LRP6 (PubMed:31073040).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
