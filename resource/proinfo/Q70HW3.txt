UniprotID	Q70HW3
Accession	Q70HW3;A8K758;B3KRZ7;F8WAB8;Q7Z786;Q96E68
EntryName	SAMC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial S-adenosylmethionine carrier protein (SAM carrier) (Solute carrier family 25 member 26)
GeneName	SLC25A26 SAMC
Length	274
Function	Mitochondrial S-adenosyl-L-methionine/S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine antiporter. Mediates the exchange of cytosolic S-adenosyl-L-methionine, the predominant methyl-group donor for macromolecule methylation processes, for mitochondrial S-adenosylhomocysteine(SAH), a by-product of methylation reactions.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
