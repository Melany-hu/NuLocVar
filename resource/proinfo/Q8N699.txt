UniprotID	Q8N699
Accession	Q8N699;Q8N396;Q8TBE8;Q9H763
EntryName	MYCT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myc target protein 1 (Myc target in myeloid cells protein 1)
GeneName	MYCT1 MTLC MTMC1
Length	235
Function	May regulate certain MYC target genes, MYC seems to be a direct upstream transcriptional activator. Does not seem to significantly affect growth cell capacity. Overexpression seems to mediate many of the known phenotypic features associated with MYC, including promotion of apoptosis, alteration of morphology, enhancement of anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenic conversion, promotion of genomic instability, and inhibition of hematopoietic differentiation (By similarity).
