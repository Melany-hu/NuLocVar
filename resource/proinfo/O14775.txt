UniprotID	O14775
Accession	O14775;B2RBR5;Q9HAU9;Q9UFT3
EntryName	GNB5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-5 (Gbeta5) (Transducin beta chain 5)
GeneName	GNB5
Length	395
Function	Enhances GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity of regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins, such as RGS7 and RGS9, hence involved in the termination of the signaling initiated by the G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) by accelerating the GTP hydrolysis on the G-alpha subunits, thereby promoting their inactivation (PubMed:27677260). Increases RGS7 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, thereby regulating mood and cognition (By similarity). Increases RGS9 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, hence contributes to the deactivation of G protein signaling initiated by D(2) dopamine receptors (PubMed:27677260). May play an important role in neuronal signaling, including in the parasympathetic, but not sympathetic, control of heart rate (By similarity).
