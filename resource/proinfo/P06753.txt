EntryName	TPM3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tropomyosin alpha-3 chain (Gamma-tropomyosin) (Tropomyosin-3) (Tropomyosin-5) (hTM5)
GeneName	TPM3
Length	285
Function	Binds to actin filaments in muscle and non-muscle cells. Plays a central role, in association with the troponin complex, in the calcium dependent regulation of vertebrate striated muscle contraction. Smooth muscle contraction is regulated by interaction with caldesmon. In non-muscle cells is implicated in stabilizing cytoskeleton actin filaments.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
