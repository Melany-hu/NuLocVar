UniprotID	Q9NZK5
Accession	Q9NZK5;A8K9H4;Q6ICF1;Q86UB6;Q8NCJ2;Q96K41
EntryName	ADA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenosine deaminase 2 (EC 3.5.4.4) (Cat eye syndrome critical region protein 1)
GeneName	ADA2 ADGF CECR1 IDGFL
Length	511
Function	Adenosine deaminase that may contribute to the degradation of extracellular adenosine, a signaling molecule that controls a variety of cellular responses. Requires elevated adenosine levels for optimal enzyme activity. Binds to cell surfaces via proteoglycans and may play a role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, independently of its enzyme activity.
