UniprotID	Q96LB9
Accession	Q96LB9;A1A4U8;Q5SY65
EntryName	PGRP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidoglycan recognition protein 3 (Peptidoglycan recognition protein I-alpha) (PGLYRPIalpha) (PGRP-I-alpha) (Peptidoglycan recognition protein intermediate alpha)
GeneName	PGLYRP3 PGRPIA
Length	341
Function	Pattern receptor that binds to murein peptidoglycans (PGN) of Gram-positive bacteria. Has bactericidal activity towards Gram-positive bacteria. May kill Gram-positive bacteria by interfering with peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Also binds to Gram-negative bacteria, and has bacteriostatic activity towards Gram-negative bacteria. Plays a role in innate immunity.
