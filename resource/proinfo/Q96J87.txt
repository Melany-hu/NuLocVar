UniprotID	Q96J87
Accession	Q96J87;B4DG28;B4DJB6;Q6PII4;Q6ZNJ7;Q8N607
EntryName	CELF6_HUMAN
ProteinName	CUGBP Elav-like family member 6 (CELF-6) (Bruno-like protein 6) (CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factor 6) (RNA-binding protein BRUNOL-6)
GeneName	CELF6 BRUNOL6
Length	481
Function	RNA-binding protein implicated in the regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. Mediates exon inclusion and/or exclusion in pre-mRNA that are subject to tissue-specific and developmentally regulated alternative splicing. Specifically activates exon 5 inclusion of TNNT2 in a muscle-specific splicing enhancer (MSE)-dependent manner. Promotes also exon exclusion of INSR pre-mRNA.
