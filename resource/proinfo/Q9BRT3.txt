UniprotID	Q9BRT3
Accession	Q9BRT3
EntryName	MIEN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Migration and invasion enhancer 1 (HBV X-transactivated gene 4 protein) (HBV XAg-transactivated protein 4) (Protein C35)
GeneName	MIEN1 C17orf37 RDX12 XTP4
Length	115
Function	Increases cell migration by inducing filopodia formation at the leading edge of migrating cells. Plays a role in regulation of apoptosis, possibly through control of CASP3. May be involved in a redox-related process.
