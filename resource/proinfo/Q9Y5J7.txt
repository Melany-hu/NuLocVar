UniprotID	Q9Y5J7
Accession	Q9Y5J7;B2R584
EntryName	TIM9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim9
GeneName	TIMM9 TIM9 TIM9A TIMM9A
Length	89
Function	Mitochondrial intermembrane chaperone that participates in the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. May also be required for the transfer of beta-barrel precursors from the TOM complex to the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) of the outer membrane. Acts as a chaperone-like protein that protects the hydrophobic precursors from aggregation and guide them through the mitochondrial intermembrane space.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
