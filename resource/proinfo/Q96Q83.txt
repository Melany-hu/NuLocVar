UniprotID	Q96Q83
Accession	Q96Q83;A6NDJ1;Q3SYI0;Q6NX57;Q96BU8
EntryName	ALKB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase alkB homolog 3 (EC 1.14.11.33) (EC 1.14.11.54) (Alkylated DNA repair protein alkB homolog 3) (hABH3) (DEPC-1) (Prostate cancer antigen 1)
GeneName	ALKBH3 ABH3 DEPC1
Length	286
Function	Dioxygenase that mediates demethylation of DNA and RNA containing 1-methyladenosine (m1A) (PubMed:12486230, PubMed:12594517, PubMed:16174769, PubMed:26863196, PubMed:26863410). Repairs alkylated DNA containing 1-methyladenosine (m1A) and 3-methylcytosine (m3C) by oxidative demethylation (PubMed:12486230, PubMed:12594517, PubMed:16174769, PubMed:25944111). Has a strong preference for single-stranded DNA (PubMed:12486230, PubMed:12594517, PubMed:16174769, PubMed:20714506). Able to process alkylated m3C within double-stranded regions via its interaction with ASCC3, which promotes DNA unwinding to generate single-stranded substrate needed for ALKBH3 (PubMed:22055184). Can repair exocyclic 3,N4-ethenocytosine adducs in single-stranded DNA (PubMed:25797601). Also acts on RNA (PubMed:12594517, PubMed:16174769, PubMed:16858410, PubMed:26863196, PubMed:26863410). Demethylates N(1)-methyladenosine (m1A) RNA, an epigenetic internal modification of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) highly enriched within 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) and in the vicinity of start codons (PubMed:26863196, PubMed:26863410). Requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate and iron (PubMed:16858410, PubMed:22055184).
