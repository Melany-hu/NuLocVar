UniprotID	Q9Y336
Accession	Q9Y336;Q6GTU4;Q9BYI9
EntryName	SIGL9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 9 (Siglec-9) (CDw329) (Protein FOAP-9) (CD antigen CD329)
GeneName	SIGLEC9 UNQ668/PRO1302
Length	463
Function	Putative adhesion molecule that mediates sialic-acid dependent binding to cells. Preferentially binds to alpha-2,3- or alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid. The sialic acid recognition site may be masked by cis interactions with sialic acids on the same cell surface.
