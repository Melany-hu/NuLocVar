UniprotID	Q12972-3
Accession	Q12972;Q5TEJ2;Q5TEJ4;Q5TIF2;Q6PKF6;Q9UBH1;Q9UBZ0
EntryName	PP1R8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (NIPP-1) (Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 8) [Includes: Activator of RNA decay (EC 3.1.4.-) (ARD-1)]
GeneName	PPP1R8 ARD1 NIPP1
Length	127
Function	Inhibitor subunit of the major nuclear protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1). It has RNA-binding activity but does not cleave RNA and may target PP-1 to RNA-associated substrates. May also be involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Binds DNA and might act as a transcriptional repressor. Seems to be required for cell proliferation.
