UniprotID	Q86WA9
Accession	Q86WA9;B2RCI7;Q86VX1;Q86YX7;Q8IV11;Q8N2I1;Q8NG03
EntryName	S2611_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium-independent sulfate anion transporter (Solute carrier family 26 member 11)
GeneName	SLC26A11
Length	606
Function	Sodium-independent anion exchanger mediating bicarbonate, chloride, sulfate and oxalate transport (By similarity). Exhibits sodium-independent sulfate anion transporter activity that may cooperate with SLC26A2 to mediate DIDS-sensitive sulfate uptake into high endothelial venules endothelial cells (HEVEC) (PubMed:12626430). In the kidney, mediates chloride-bicarbonate exchange, facilitating V-ATPase-mediated acid secretion (By similarity). May function as a chloride channel, playing an important role in moderating chloride homeostasis and neuronal activity in the cerebellum (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Lysosome membrane; Apical cell membrane; Basolateral cell membrane
