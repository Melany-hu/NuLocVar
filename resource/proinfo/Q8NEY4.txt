UniprotID	Q8NEY4
Accession	Q8NEY4;Q96EL8
EntryName	VATC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit C 2 (V-ATPase subunit C 2) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit C 2)
GeneName	ATP6V1C2
Length	427
Function	Subunit of the V1 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons (By similarity). V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment (By similarity). Subunit C is necessary for the assembly of the catalytic sector of the enzyme and is likely to have a specific function in its catalytic activity (By similarity).
