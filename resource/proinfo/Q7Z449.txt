ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 2U1 (Long-chain fatty acid omega-monooxygenase) (EC 1.14.14.80)
GeneName	CYP2U1
Length	544
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid and its conjugates (PubMed:14660610, PubMed:24563460). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR; NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:14660610, PubMed:24563460). Acts as an omega and omega-1 hydroxylase for arachidonic acid and possibly for other long chain fatty acids. May modulate the arachidonic acid signaling pathway and play a role in other fatty acid signaling processes (PubMed:14660610, PubMed:24563460). May down-regulate the biological activities of N-arachidonoyl-serotonin, an endocannabinoid that has anti-nociceptive effects through inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase FAAH, TRPV1 receptor and T-type calcium channels. Catalyzes C-2 oxidation of the indole ring of N-arachidonoyl-serotonin forming a less active product 2-oxo-N-arachidonoyl-serotonin (PubMed:24563460).
