UniprotID	P16949
Accession	P16949;A2A2D1;B2R4E7;B7Z8N4;D3DPJ5
EntryName	STMN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Stathmin (Leukemia-associated phosphoprotein p18) (Metablastin) (Oncoprotein 18) (Op18) (Phosphoprotein p19) (pp19) (Prosolin) (Protein Pr22) (pp17)
GeneName	STMN1 C1orf215 LAP18 OP18
Length	149
Function	Involved in the regulation of the microtubule (MT) filament system by destabilizing microtubules. Prevents assembly and promotes disassembly of microtubules. Phosphorylation at Ser-16 may be required for axon formation during neurogenesis. Involved in the control of the learned and innate fear (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
