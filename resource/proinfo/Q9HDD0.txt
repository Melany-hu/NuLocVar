UniprotID	Q9HDD0
Accession	Q9HDD0;D2KX19;Q6X7C0;Q86WS9;X6R3D1
EntryName	PLAT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholipase A and acyltransferase 1 (EC 2.3.1.-) (EC 3.1.1.32) (EC 3.1.1.4) (HRAS-like suppressor 1) (HRSL1) (Phospholipid-metabolizing enzyme A-C1)
GeneName	PLAAT1 HRASLS
Length	168
Function	Exhibits both phospholipase A1/2 and acyltransferase activities (PubMed:21880860, PubMed:26503625). Shows phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and A2 (PLA2) activity, catalyzing the calcium-independent release of fatty acids from the sn-1 or sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids (PubMed:21880860, PubMed:22825852, PubMed:27623847). Shows O-acyltransferase activity, catalyzing the transfer of a fatty acyl group from glycerophospholipid to the hydroxyl group of lysophospholipid (PubMed:21880860). Shows N-acyltransferase activity, catalyzing the calcium-independent transfer of a fatty acyl group at the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and other glycerophospholipids to the primary amine of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), forming N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) which serves as precursor for N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) (PubMed:21880860, PubMed:22825852, PubMed:27623847).
