UniprotID	Q8NHC4
Accession	Q8NHC4;B9EH35;Q6IFH2
EntryName	O10J5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Olfactory receptor 10J5 (Olfactory receptor OR1-28)
GeneName	OR10J5
Length	309
Function	Olfactory receptor. Activated by the synthetic floral odorant, lyral, and by alpha-cedrene, a sesquiterpene constituent of cedarwood oil. Its activation increases intracellular Ca(2+) (PubMed:25791473, PubMed:28842679). Acts as a key regulator of myogenesis through its actions on cell migration and adhesion by activating the Ca(2+)-dependent AKT signal transduction pathway (By similarity). Also acts as a regulator of angiogenesis (PubMed:25791473). Moreover, plays a role in the regulation of lipid accumulation in hepatocytes via the cAMP-PKA pathway (PubMed:28842679). May be involved in sperm chemotaxis and motility (By similarity).
