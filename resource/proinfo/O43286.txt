UniprotID	O43286
Accession	O43286;E1P625;Q2M394;Q9UJQ8;U6C5D7
EntryName	B4GT5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 5 (Beta-1,4-GalTase 5) (Beta4Gal-T5) (b4Gal-T5) (EC 2.4.1.-) (Beta-1,4-GalT II) (Glucosylceramide beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase) (EC 2.4.1.274) (Lactosylceramide synthase) (LacCer synthase) (UDP-Gal:beta-GlcNAc beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 5) (UDP-galactose:beta-N-acetylglucosamine beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 5)
GeneName	B4GALT5
Length	388
Function	Catalyzes the synthesis of lactosylceramide (LacCer) via the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to glucosylceramide (GlcCer) (PubMed:24498430). LacCer is the starting point in the biosynthesis of all gangliosides (membrane-bound glycosphingolipids) which play pivotal roles in the CNS including neuronal maturation and axonal and myelin formation (By similarity). Plays a role in the glycosylation of BMPR1A and regulation of its protein stability (By similarity). Essential for extraembryonic development during early embryogenesis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack membrane; Golgi apparatus
