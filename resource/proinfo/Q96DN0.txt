UniprotID	Q96DN0
Accession	Q96DN0
EntryName	ERP27_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 27 (ER protein 27) (ERp27) (Inactive protein disulfide-isomerase 27)
GeneName	ERP27 C12orf46 UNQ781/PRO1575
Length	273
Function	Specifically binds unfolded proteins and may recruit protein disulfide isomerase PDIA3 to unfolded substrates (PubMed:16940051, PubMed:23192347). Binds protein substrates via a hydrophobic pocket in the C-terminal domain (PubMed:16940051, PubMed:23192347). May play a role in the unfolded stress response (PubMed:23192347).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum lumen
