UniprotID	Q92819
Accession	Q92819;Q32MM3
EntryName	HYAS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hyaluronan synthase 2 (EC 2.4.1.212) (Hyaluronate synthase 2) (Hyaluronic acid synthase 2) (HA synthase 2)
GeneName	HAS2
Length	552
Function	Catalyzes the addition of GlcNAc or GlcUA monosaccharides to the nascent hyaluronan polymer (Probable) (PubMed:20507985, PubMed:21228273, PubMed:23303191, PubMed:32993960). Therefore, it is essential to hyaluronan synthesis a major component of most extracellular matrices that has a structural role in tissues architectures and regulates cell adhesion, migration and differentiation (PubMed:20507985, PubMed:21228273, PubMed:8798477). This is one of three isoenzymes responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis and it is particularly responsible for the synthesis of high molecular mass hyaluronan (By similarity).
