Accession	O43709;A8K501;C9K060;Q96P12;Q9BQ58;Q9HBP9
EntryName	BUD23_HUMAN
ProteinName	18S rRNA (guanine-N(7))-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.-) (Bud site selection protein 23 homolog) (Metastasis-related methyltransferase 1) (Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosomal region 22 protein) (rRNA methyltransferase and ribosome maturation factor)
GeneName	BUD23 MERM1 WBSCR22 HUSSY-03 PP3381
Length	281
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase that specifically methylates the N(7) position of a guanine in 18S rRNA (PubMed:25851604). Requires the methyltransferase adapter protein TRM112 for full rRNA methyltransferase activity (PubMed:25851604). Involved in the pre-rRNA processing steps leading to small-subunit rRNA production independently of its RNA-modifying catalytic activity (PubMed:25851604). Important for biogenesis end export of the 40S ribosomal subunit independent on its methyltransferase activity (PubMed:24086612). Locus-specific steroid receptor coactivator. Potentiates transactivation by glucocorticoid (NR3C1), mineralocorticoid (NR3C2), androgen (AR) and progesterone (PGR) receptors (PubMed:24488492). Required for the maintenance of open chromatin at the TSC22D3/GILZ locus to facilitate NR3C1 loading on the response elements (PubMed:24488492). Required for maintenance of dimethylation on histone H3 'Lys-79' (H3K79me2), although direct histone methyltransferase activity is not observed in vitro (PubMed:24488492).
