UniprotID	Q8N5D6
Accession	Q8N5D6;A8K633;B2RA95;B7Z8S5;Q45F07;Q5T7U9;Q5T7V1;Q8N2K4;Q9UKI5
EntryName	GBGT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Globoside alpha-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (EC 2.4.1.-) (Forssman glycolipid synthase-like protein)
GeneName	GBGT1 UNQ2513/PRO6002
Length	347
Function	Has lost the ability to synthesize Forssman glycolipid antigen (FORS1/FG) (PubMed:10506200). Might have acquired an alternative function in glycosphingolipid metabolism, but it remains to be established. It appears to have drifted more slowly than confirmed pseudogenes in the glycosyltransferase 6 family, suggesting that it has remained under evolutionary pressure.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
