UniprotID	P59538
Accession	P59538;P59547;Q17R84;Q645X5
EntryName	T2R31_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 31 (T2R31) (Taste receptor type 2 member 44) (T2R44) (Taste receptor type 2 member 53) (T2R53)
GeneName	TAS2R31 TAS2R44
Length	309
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5 (By similarity). Activated by the sulfonyl amide sweeteners saccharin and acesulfame K.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
