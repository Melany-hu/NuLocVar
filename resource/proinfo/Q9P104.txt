UniprotID	Q9P104
Accession	Q9P104;Q5T7Y0;Q5TE53;Q8TEW7;Q96H13;Q9BZ24;Q9NQF4;Q9Y411
EntryName	DOK5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Docking protein 5 (Downstream of tyrosine kinase 5) (Insulin receptor substrate 6) (IRS-6) (IRS6)
GeneName	DOK5 C20orf180
Length	306
Function	DOK proteins are enzymatically inert adaptor or scaffolding proteins. They provide a docking platform for the assembly of multimolecular signaling complexes. DOK5 functions in RET-mediated neurite outgrowth and plays a positive role in activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Putative link with downstream effectors of RET in neuronal differentiation.
