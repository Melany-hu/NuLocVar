UniprotID	Q14953
Accession	Q14953;A0A0C4ZMZ1
EntryName	KI2S5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 2DS5 (CD158 antigen-like family member G) (Natural killer-associated transcript 9) (NKAT-9) (CD antigen CD158g)
GeneName	KIR2DS5 CD158G NKAT9
Length	304
Function	Activating natural killer (NK) receptor that recognizes C2 epitopes of HLA-C alleles. Bridging the innate and adaptive immune systems, NK cells express a number of cell surface receptors which either inhibit or stimulate their cytotoxicity (PubMed:18624290, PubMed:18682925, PubMed:28685972). Able to activate NK cells citotoxicity and cytokine production such as IFNG (PubMed:18624290, PubMed:24269691). Receptor functions are attenuated even lost in some alleles, such as KIR2DS5*002 represented in this entry (PubMed:28685972).
