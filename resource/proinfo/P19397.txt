EntryName	CD53_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leukocyte surface antigen CD53 (Cell surface glycoprotein CD53) (Tetraspanin-25) (Tspan-25) (CD antigen CD53)
GeneName	CD53 MOX44 TSPAN25
Length	219
Function	Structural component of specialized membrane microdomains known as tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TERMs), which act as platforms for receptor clustering and signaling (PubMed:28487417). Participates thereby in diverse biological functions such as cell signal transduction, adhesion, migration and protein trafficking (PubMed:32974937, PubMed:35767951). Plays a role in the activation of monocytes and B-cells (PubMed:8335905). Acts as an essential regulator of B-cell development by promoting interleukin-7 receptor/IL7R signaling (By similarity). Also promotes, in B-cells, the BCR signaling by recruiting PKC to the plasma membrane in order to phosphorylate its substrates (PubMed:28487417). Plays an essential role in B- and T-cells homing to lymph nodes by stabilizing L-selectin/SELL cell surface expression (By similarity). Also mediates metabolic and inflammatory functions in hepatocytes and adipose tissue by promoting TNF-alpha and LPS signaling independent of the immune compartment (By similarity).
