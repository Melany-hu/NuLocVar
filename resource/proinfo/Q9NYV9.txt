UniprotID	Q9NYV9
Accession	Q9NYV9;Q4G0I5;Q502V8;Q645X2
EntryName	T2R13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 13 (T2R13) (Taste receptor family B member 3) (TRB3)
GeneName	TAS2R13
Length	303
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
