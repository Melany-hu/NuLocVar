UniprotID	O60669
Accession	O60669;Q8NEM3;Q9UPB3
EntryName	MOT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT 2) (Solute carrier family 16 member 7)
GeneName	SLC16A7 MCT2
Length	478
Function	Proton-coupled monocarboxylate symporter. Catalyzes the rapid transport across the plasma membrane of monocarboxylates such as L-lactate, pyruvate and ketone bodies, acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetate (PubMed:32415067, PubMed:9786900). Dimerization is functionally required and both subunits work cooperatively in transporting substrate (PubMed:32415067).
