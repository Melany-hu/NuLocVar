UniprotID	P26367
Accession	P26367;Q6N006;Q99413
EntryName	PAX6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Paired box protein Pax-6 (Aniridia type II protein) (Oculorhombin)
GeneName	PAX6 AN2
Length	422
Function	Transcription factor with important functions in the development of the eye, nose, central nervous system and pancreas. Required for the differentiation of pancreatic islet alpha cells (By similarity). Competes with PAX4 in binding to a common element in the glucagon, insulin and somatostatin promoters. Regulates specification of the ventral neuron subtypes by establishing the correct progenitor domains (By similarity). Acts as a transcriptional repressor of NFATC1-mediated gene expression (By similarity).
