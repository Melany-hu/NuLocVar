UniprotID	Q8N488
Accession	Q8N488;Q9P2W5;Q9UMW4
EntryName	RYBP_HUMAN
ProteinName	RING1 and YY1-binding protein (Apoptin-associating protein 1) (APAP-1) (Death effector domain-associated factor) (DED-associated factor) (YY1 and E4TF1-associated factor 1)
GeneName	RYBP DEDAF YEAF1
Length	228
Function	Component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1-like complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones; it mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119', rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility (PubMed:25519132). Component of a PRC1-like complex that mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119' on the X chromosome and is required for normal silencing of one copy of the X chromosome in XX females. May stimulate ubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119' by recruiting the complex to target sites (By similarity). Inhibits ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of TP53, and thereby plays a role in regulating transcription of TP53 target genes (PubMed:19098711). May also regulate the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of other proteins like FANK1 to regulate apoptosis (PubMed:14765135, PubMed:27060496). May be implicated in the regulation of the transcription as a repressor of the transcriptional activity of E4TF1 (PubMed:11953439). May bind to DNA (By similarity). May play a role in the repression of tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer by down-regulating SRRM3 (PubMed:27748911).
