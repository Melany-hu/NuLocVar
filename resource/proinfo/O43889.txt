EntryName	CREB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3 (CREB-3) (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 3) (Leucine zipper protein) (Luman) (Transcription factor LZIP-alpha) [Cleaved into: Processed cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3 (N-terminal Luman) (Transcriptionally active form)]
GeneName	CREB3 LZIP
Length	371
Function	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound sequence-specific transcription factor that directly binds DNA and activates transcription (PubMed:10984507, PubMed:15845366, PubMed:16940180, PubMed:19779205, PubMed:9271389). Plays a role in the unfolded protein response (UPR), promoting cell survival versus ER stress-induced apoptotic cell death (PubMed:15845366, PubMed:16940180). Also involved in cell proliferation, migration and differentiation, tumor suppression and inflammatory gene expression. Acts as a positive regulator of LKN-1/CCL15-induced chemotaxis signaling of leukocyte cell migration (PubMed:15001559, PubMed:17296613, PubMed:19779205). Associates with chromatin to the HERPUD1 promoter (PubMed:16940180). Also induces transcriptional activation of chemokine receptors (PubMed:17296613, PubMed:18587271).
