UniprotID	O60383
Accession	O60383;Q4VAW5
EntryName	GDF9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Growth/differentiation factor 9 (GDF-9)
GeneName	GDF9
Length	454
Function	Required for ovarian folliculogenesis. Promotes primordial follicle development. Stimulates granulosa cell proliferation. Promotes cell transition from G0/G1 to S and G2/M phases, through an increase of CCND1 and CCNE1 expression, and RB1 phosphorylation. It regulates STAR expression and cAMP-dependent progesterone release in granulosa and thecal cells. Attenuates the suppressive effects of activin A on STAR expression and progesterone production by increasing the expression of inhibin B. It suppresses FST and FSTL3 production in granulosa-lutein cells.
