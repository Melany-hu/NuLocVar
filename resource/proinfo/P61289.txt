UniprotID	P61289
Accession	P61289;A8K9A3;O35563;P97373;Q12920;Q13172;Q9BQD9
EntryName	PSME3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteasome activator complex subunit 3 (11S regulator complex subunit gamma) (REG-gamma) (Activator of multicatalytic protease subunit 3) (Ki nuclear autoantigen) (Proteasome activator 28 subunit gamma) (PA28g) (PA28gamma)
GeneName	PSME3
Length	254
Function	Subunit of the 11S REG-gamma (also called PA28-gamma) proteasome regulator, a doughnut-shaped homoheptamer which associates with the proteasome. 11S REG-gamma activates the trypsin-like catalytic subunit of the proteasome but inhibits the chymotrypsin-like and postglutamyl-preferring (PGPH) subunits. Facilitates the MDM2-p53/TP53 interaction which promotes ubiquitination- and MDM2-dependent proteasomal degradation of p53/TP53, limiting its accumulation and resulting in inhibited apoptosis after DNA damage. May also be involved in cell cycle regulation. Mediates CCAR2 and CHEK2-dependent SIRT1 inhibition (PubMed:25361978).
