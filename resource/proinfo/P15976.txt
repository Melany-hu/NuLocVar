UniprotID	P15976
Accession	P15976;Q96GB8
EntryName	GATA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Erythroid transcription factor (Eryf1) (GATA-binding factor 1) (GATA-1) (GF-1) (NF-E1 DNA-binding protein)
GeneName	GATA1 ERYF1 GF1
Length	413
Function	Transcriptional activator or repressor which serves as a general switch factor for erythroid development (PubMed:35030251). It binds to DNA sites with the consensus sequence 5'-GATA-3' within regulatory regions of globin genes and of other genes expressed in erythroid cells. Activates the transcription of genes involved in erythroid differentiation of K562 erythroleukemia cells, including HBB, HBG1/2, ALAS2 and HMBS (PubMed:24245781).
