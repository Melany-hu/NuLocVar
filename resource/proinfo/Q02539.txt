UniprotID	Q02539
Accession	Q02539;Q3MJ34
EntryName	H11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H1.1 (Histone H1a)
GeneName	H1-1 H1F1 HIST1H1A
Length	215
Function	Histone H1 protein binds to linker DNA between nucleosomes forming the macromolecular structure known as the chromatin fiber. Histones H1 are necessary for the condensation of nucleosome chains into higher-order structured fibers. Also acts as a regulator of individual gene transcription through chromatin remodeling, nucleosome spacing and DNA methylation (By similarity).
