UniprotID	P51817
Accession	P51817
EntryName	PRKX_HUMAN
ProteinName	cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit PRKX (PrKX) (Protein kinase X) (Protein kinase X-linked) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase PRKX) (EC 2.7.11.1) (Protein kinase PKX1)
GeneName	PRKX PKX1
Length	358
Function	Serine/threonine protein kinase regulated by and mediating cAMP signaling in cells. Acts through phosphorylation of downstream targets that may include CREB, SMAD6 and PKD1 and has multiple functions in cellular differentiation and epithelial morphogenesis. Regulates myeloid cell differentiation through SMAD6 phosphorylation. Involved in nephrogenesis by stimulating renal epithelial cell migration and tubulogenesis. Also involved in angiogenesis through stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation, migration and vascular-like structure formation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus
