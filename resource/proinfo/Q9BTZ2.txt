EntryName	DHRS4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 4 (EC 1.1.1.184) (NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase) (CR) (NADPH-dependent retinol dehydrogenase/reductase) (NRDR) (humNRDR) (Peroxisomal short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase) (PSCD) (SCAD-SRL) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 25C member 2) (Protein SDR25C2) (Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family member 4)
GeneName	DHRS4 SDR25C2 UNQ851/PRO1800
Length	278
Function	NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase which catalyzes the reduction of a variety of compounds bearing carbonyl groups including ketosteroids, alpha-dicarbonyl compounds, aldehydes, aromatic ketones and quinones (PubMed:18571493, PubMed:19056333). Reduces 3-ketosteroids and benzil into 3beta-hydroxysteroids and R-benzoin, respectively, in contrast to the stereoselectivity of non-primate DHRS4s which produce 3alpha-hydroxysteroids and S-benzoin (PubMed:19056333). Diplays low activity toward all-trans-retinal and no activity toward 9-cis-retinal as compared to non-primate mammals (PubMed:18571493, PubMed:19056333). In the reverse reaction, catalyze the NAD-dependent oxidation of 3beta-hydroxysteroids and alcohol, but with much lower efficiency (PubMed:18571493, PubMed:19056333). Involved in the metabolism of 3beta-hydroxysteroids, isatin and xenobiotic carbonyl compounds (PubMed:18571493, PubMed:19056333).
