ProteinName	Myeloid cell surface antigen CD33 (Sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 3) (Siglec-3) (gp67) (CD antigen CD33)
GeneName	CD33 SIGLEC3
Length	364
Function	Sialic-acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) that plays a role in mediating cell-cell interactions and in maintaining immune cells in a resting state (PubMed:10611343, PubMed:11320212, PubMed:15597323). Preferentially recognizes and binds alpha-2,3- and more avidly alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid-bearing glycans (PubMed:7718872). Upon engagement of ligands such as C1q or syalylated glycoproteins, two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) located in CD33 cytoplasmic tail are phosphorylated by Src-like kinases such as LCK (PubMed:10887109, PubMed:28325905). These phosphorylations provide docking sites for the recruitment and activation of protein-tyrosine phosphatases PTPN6/SHP-1 and PTPN11/SHP-2 (PubMed:10206955, PubMed:10556798, PubMed:10887109). In turn, these phosphatases regulate downstream pathways through dephosphorylation of signaling molecules (PubMed:10206955, PubMed:10887109). One of the repressive effect of CD33 on monocyte activation requires phosphoinositide 3-kinase/PI3K (PubMed:15597323).
