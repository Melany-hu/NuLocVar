UniprotID	Q4LDG9
Accession	Q4LDG9;B2RD38;Q5JPB7;Q9BS43
EntryName	DNAL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynein axonemal light chain 1 (LC1)
GeneName	DNAL1 C14orf168
Length	190
Function	Part of the multisubunit axonemal ATPase complexes that generate the force for cilia motility and govern beat frequency (By similarity). Component of the outer arm dynein (ODA). May be involved in a mechanosensory feedback mechanism controlling ODA activity based on external conformational cues by tethering the outer arm dynein heavy chain (DNAH5) to the microtubule within the axoneme (By similarity). Important for ciliary function in the airways and for the function of the cilia that produce the nodal flow essential for the determination of the left-right asymmetry (PubMed:21496787).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium axoneme
