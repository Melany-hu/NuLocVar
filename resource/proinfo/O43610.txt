UniprotID	O43610
Accession	O43610;A8K0H8
EntryName	SPY3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein sprouty homolog 3 (Spry-3) (Sprouty RTK signaling antagonist 3) (Sprouty3)
GeneName	SPRY3
Length	288
Function	Inhibits neurite branching, arbor length and neurite complexity (By similarity). Inhibits EGF-mediated p42/44 ERK signaling (By similarity). Negatively regulates the MAPK cascade, resulting in a reduction of extracellular matrix protein accumulation (PubMed:30878395). May function as an antagonist of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathways and may negatively modulate respiratory organogenesis (PubMed:9458049).
