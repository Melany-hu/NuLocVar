UniprotID	P63151
Accession	P63151;B2RBU8;B4E1T7;P50409;Q00007
EntryName	2ABA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A 55 kDa regulatory subunit B alpha isoform (PP2A subunit B isoform B55-alpha) (B55) (PP2A subunit B isoform PR55-alpha) (PP2A subunit B isoform R2-alpha) (PP2A subunit B isoform alpha)
GeneName	PPP2R2A
Length	447
Function	Substrate-recognition subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that plays a key role in cell cycle by controlling mitosis entry and exit (PubMed:1849734, PubMed:33108758). Involved in chromosome clustering during late mitosis by mediating dephosphorylation of MKI67 (By similarity). Essential for serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation of WEE1, preventing its ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, increasing WEE1 protein levels, and promoting the G2/M checkpoint (PubMed:33108758).
