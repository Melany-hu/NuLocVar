UniprotID	Q969I6
Accession	Q969I6;A8K553
EntryName	S38A4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 4 (Amino acid transporter A3) (Na(+)-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 4) (Solute carrier family 38 member 4) (System A amino acid transporter 3) (System N amino acid transporter 3)
GeneName	SLC38A4 ATA3 NAT3 SNAT4
Length	547
Function	Symporter that cotransports neutral amino acids and sodium ions from the extraccellular to the intracellular side of the cell membrane (PubMed:11342143, PubMed:19015196, PubMed:33928121). The transport is electrogenic, pH dependent and partially tolerates substitution of Na(+) by Li(+) (PubMed:11414754). Preferentially transports smaller amino acids, such as glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, L-asparagine and L-threonine, followed by L-cysteine, L-histidine, L-proline and L-glutamine and L-methionine (PubMed:11414754, PubMed:33928121).
