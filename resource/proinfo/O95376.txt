UniprotID	O95376
Accession	O95376;Q9HBZ6;Q9UEM9
EntryName	ARI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ARIH2 (ARI-2) (Protein ariadne-2 homolog) (EC 2.3.2.31) (Triad1 protein)
GeneName	ARIH2 ARI2 TRIAD1 HT005
Length	493
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which catalyzes ubiquitination of target proteins together with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 UBE2L3 (PubMed:16118314, PubMed:17646546, PubMed:19340006, PubMed:24076655, PubMed:33268465, PubMed:34518685, PubMed:38418882). Acts as an atypical E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase by working together with cullin-5-RING ubiquitin ligase complex (ECS complex, also named CRL5 complex) and initiating ubiquitination of ECS substrates: associates with ECS complex and specifically mediates addition of the first ubiquitin on ECS targets (PubMed:33268465, PubMed:34518685, PubMed:38418882). The initial ubiquitin is then elongated (PubMed:33268465). E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity is activated upon binding to neddylated form of the cullin-5 (CUL5) component of the ECS complex (PubMed:24076655). Together with the ECS(ASB9) complex, catalyzes ubiquitination of CKB (PubMed:33268465). Promotes ubiquitination of DCUN1D1 (PubMed:30587576). Mediates 'Lys-6', 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:16118314, PubMed:17646546, PubMed:19340006). May play a role in myelopoiesis (PubMed:19340006).
