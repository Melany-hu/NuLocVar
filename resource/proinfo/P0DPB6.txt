UniprotID	P0DPB6
Accession	P0DPB6;Q5TBX2;Q96BR3;Q9Y2S0
EntryName	RPAC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerases I and III subunit RPAC2 (RNA polymerases I and III subunit AC2) (AC19) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit D) (RNA polymerase I 16 kDa subunit) (RPA16) (RPC16) (hRPA19)
GeneName	POLR1D
Length	133
Function	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Common component of RNA polymerases I and III which synthesize ribosomal RNA precursors and short non-coding RNAs including 5S rRNA, snRNAs, tRNAs and miRNAs, respectively.
