EntryName	TEAD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcriptional enhancer factor TEF-5 (DTEF-1) (TEA domain family member 3) (TEAD-3)
GeneName	TEAD3 TEAD5 TEF5
Length	435
Function	Transcription factor which plays a key role in the Hippo signaling pathway, a pathway involved in organ size control and tumor suppression by restricting proliferation and promoting apoptosis. The core of this pathway is composed of a kinase cascade wherein MST1/MST2, in complex with its regulatory protein SAV1, phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2 in complex with its regulatory protein MOB1, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates YAP1 oncoprotein and WWTR1/TAZ. Acts by mediating gene expression of YAP1 and WWTR1/TAZ, thereby regulating cell proliferation, migration and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction. Binds to multiple functional elements of the human chorionic somatomammotropin-B gene enhancer.
