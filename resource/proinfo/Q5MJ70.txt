EntryName	SPDYA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Speedy protein A (Rapid inducer of G2/M progression in oocytes A) (RINGO A) (hSpy/Ringo A) (Speedy-1) (Spy1)
GeneName	SPDYA SPDY1 SPY1
Length	313
Function	Regulates the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle by binding and activating CDK1 and CDK2 (PubMed:12972555). Contributes to CDK2 activation without promoting CDK2 phosphorylation, by inducing a conformation change of the CDK2 T-loop that obstructs the substrate-binding cleft prior to kinase activation (PubMed:28666995). Mediates cell survival during the DNA damage process through activation of CDK2 (PubMed:12839962).
