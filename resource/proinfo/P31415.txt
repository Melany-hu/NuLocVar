ProteinName	Calsequestrin-1 (Calmitine) (Calsequestrin, skeletal muscle isoform)
GeneName	CASQ1 CASQ
Length	396
Function	Calsequestrin is a high-capacity, moderate affinity, calcium-binding protein and thus acts as an internal calcium store in muscle (PubMed:28895244). Calcium ions are bound by clusters of acidic residues at the protein surface, often at the interface between subunits. Can bind around 80 Ca(2+) ions (PubMed:28895244). Regulates the release of lumenal Ca(2+) via the calcium release channel RYR1; this plays an important role in triggering muscle contraction. Negatively regulates store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) activity (PubMed:27185316).
