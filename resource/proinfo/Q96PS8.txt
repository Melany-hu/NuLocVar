EntryName	AQP10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aquaporin-10 (AQP-10) (Aquaglyceroporin-10) (Small intestine aquaporin)
GeneName	AQP10
Length	301
Function	Aquaglyceroporins form homotetrameric transmembrane channels, with each monomer independently mediating glycerol and water transport across the plasma membrane along their osmotic gradient (PubMed:11573934, PubMed:12084581, PubMed:21733844, PubMed:23382902, PubMed:30420639). Could also be permeable to urea (PubMed:12084581). Among aquaglyceroporins, it exhibits a unique pH-gated glycerol transport activity, being more active at acidic pH. It most likely plays a central role in the efflux of glycerol formed during triglyceride hydrolysis in adipocytes and in glycerol uptake by enterocytes, as both processes occur and are stimulated at acidic pH (PubMed:11573934, PubMed:23382902, PubMed:30420639).
