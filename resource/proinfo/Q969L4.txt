UniprotID	Q969L4
Accession	Q969L4
EntryName	LSM10_HUMAN
ProteinName	U7 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein LSm10
GeneName	LSM10
Length	123
Function	Appears to function in the U7 snRNP complex that is involved in histone 3'-end processing. Increases U7 snRNA levels but not histone 3'-end pre-mRNA processing activity, when overexpressed. Required for cell cycle progression from G1 to S phases. Binds specifically to U7 snRNA. Binds to the downstream cleavage product (DCP) of histone pre-mRNA in a U7 snRNP dependent manner.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
