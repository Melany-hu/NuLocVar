UniprotID	Q9NTU4
Accession	Q9NTU4
EntryName	CTSRZ_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cation channel sperm-associated auxiliary subunit zeta (CatSper-zeta) (CatSperzeta) (Testis-expressed protein 40)
GeneName	CATSPERZ C11orf20 TEX40
Length	200
Function	Auxiliary component of the CatSper complex, a complex involved in sperm cell hyperactivation. Sperm cell hyperactivation is needed for sperm motility which is essential late in the preparation of sperm for fertilization. Required for a distribution of the CatSper complex in linear quadrilateral nanodomains along the flagellum, maximizing fertilization inside the mammalian female reproductive tract. Together with EFCAB9, associates with the CatSper channel pore and is required for the two-row structure of each single CatSper channel.
Subcellular Location	Cell projection; Cilium; Flagellum membrane
