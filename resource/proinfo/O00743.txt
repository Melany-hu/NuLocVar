EntryName	PPP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 6 catalytic subunit (PP6C) (EC 3.1.3.16) [Cleaved into: Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 6 catalytic subunit, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	PPP6C PPP6
Length	305
Function	Catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) (PubMed:17079228, PubMed:29053956, PubMed:32474700). PP6 is a component of a signaling pathway regulating cell cycle progression in response to IL2 receptor stimulation (PubMed:10227379). N-terminal domain restricts G1 to S phase progression in cancer cells, in part through control of cyclin D1 (PubMed:17568194). During mitosis, regulates spindle positioning (PubMed:27335426). Down-regulates MAP3K7 kinase activation of the IL1 signaling pathway by dephosphorylation of MAP3K7 (PubMed:17079228). Also participates in the innate immune defense against viruses by desphosphorylating RIGI, an essential step that triggers RIGI-mediated signaling activation (PubMed:29053956). Also regulates innate immunity by acting as a negative regulator of the cGAS-STING pathway: mediates dephosphorylation and inactivation of CGAS and STING1 (PubMed:32474700, PubMed:32753499). CGAS dephosphorylation at 'Ser-435' impairs its ability to bind GTP, thereby inactivating it (PubMed:32474700).
