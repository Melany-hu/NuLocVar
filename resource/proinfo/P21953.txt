UniprotID	P21953
Accession	P21953;Q5T2J3;Q9BQL0
EntryName	ODBB_HUMAN
ProteinName	2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase subunit beta, mitochondrial (EC 1.2.4.4) (Branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase E1 component beta chain) (BCKDE1B) (BCKDH E1-beta)
GeneName	BCKDHB
Length	392
Function	Together with BCKDHA forms the heterotetrameric E1 subunit of the mitochondrial branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex. The BCKD complex catalyzes the multi-step oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoacids derived from the branched-chain amino-acids valine, leucine and isoleucine producing CO2 and acyl-CoA which is subsequently utilized to produce energy. The E1 subunit catalyzes the first step with the decarboxylation of the alpha-ketoacid forming an enzyme-product intermediate. A reductive acylation mediated by the lipoylamide cofactor of E2 extracts the acyl group from the E1 active site for the next step of the reaction.
