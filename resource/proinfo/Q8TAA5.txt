UniprotID	Q8TAA5
Accession	Q8TAA5;B4DFA6;Q49AJ6
EntryName	GRPE2_HUMAN
ProteinName	GrpE protein homolog 2, mitochondrial (Mt-GrpE#2)
GeneName	GRPEL2
Length	225
Function	Essential component of the PAM complex, a complex required for the translocation of transit peptide-containing proteins from the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix in an ATP-dependent manner. Seems to control the nucleotide-dependent binding of mitochondrial HSP70 to substrate proteins. Stimulates ATPase activity of mt-HSP70. May also serve to modulate the interconversion of oligomeric (inactive) and monomeric (active) forms of mt-HSP70 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
