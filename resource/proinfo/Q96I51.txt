EntryName	RCC1L_HUMAN
ProteinName	RCC1-like G exchanging factor-like protein (RCC1-like protein) (Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosomal region 16 protein)
GeneName	RCC1L WBSCR16
Length	464
Function	Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for mitochondrial dynamin-related GTPase OPA1. Activates OPA1, by exchanging bound GDP for free GTP, and drives OPA1 and MFN1-dependent mitochondrial fusion (PubMed:28746876). Plays an essential role in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis. As a component of a functional protein-RNA module, consisting of RCC1L, NGRN, RPUSD3, RPUSD4, TRUB2, FASTKD2 and 16S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (16S mt-rRNA), controls 16S mt-rRNA abundance and is required for intra-mitochondrial translation of core subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system (PubMed:27667664).
