UniprotID	Q15327
Accession	Q15327;Q96LE7
EntryName	ANKR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 1 (Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein) (Cytokine-inducible gene C-193 protein) (Cytokine-inducible nuclear protein)
GeneName	ANKRD1 C193 CARP HA1A2
Length	319
Function	May play an important role in endothelial cell activation. May act as a nuclear transcription factor that negatively regulates the expression of cardiac genes. Induction seems to be correlated with apoptotic cell death in hepatoma cells.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
