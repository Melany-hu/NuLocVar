UniprotID	O75751
Accession	O75751;Q5SYN6;Q9UP02
EntryName	S22A3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 22 member 3 (Extraneuronal monoamine transporter) (EMT) (Organic cation transporter 3) (OCT3)
GeneName	SLC22A3 EMTH OCT3
Length	556
Function	Electrogenic voltage-dependent transporter that mediates the transport of a variety of organic cations such as endogenous bioactive amines, cationic drugs and xenobiotics (PubMed:10196521, PubMed:10966924, PubMed:12538837, PubMed:17460754, PubMed:20858707). Cation cellular uptake or release is driven by the electrochemical potential, i.e. membrane potential and concentration gradient (PubMed:10966924). Functions as a Na(+)- and Cl(-)-independent, bidirectional uniporter (PubMed:12538837). Implicated in monoamine neurotransmitters uptake such as dopamine, adrenaline/epinephrine, noradrenaline/norepinephrine, histamine, serotonin and tyramine, thereby supporting a role in homeostatic regulation of aminergic neurotransmission in the brain (PubMed:10196521, PubMed:16581093, PubMed:20858707). Transports dopaminergic neuromodulators cyclo(his-pro) and salsolinol with low efficiency (PubMed:17460754). May be involved in the uptake and disposition of cationic compounds by renal clearance from the blood flow (PubMed:10966924). May contribute to regulate the transport of cationic compounds in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable). Mediates the transport of polyamine spermidine and putrescine (By similarity). Mediates the bidirectional transport of polyamine agmatine (PubMed:12538837). Also transports guanidine (PubMed:10966924). May also mediate intracellular transport of organic cations, thereby playing a role in amine metabolism and intracellular signaling (By similarity).
