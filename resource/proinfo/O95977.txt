UniprotID	O95977
Accession	O95977;D6W612
EntryName	S1PR4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 4 (S1P receptor 4) (S1P4) (Endothelial differentiation G-protein coupled receptor 6) (Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor Edg-6) (S1P receptor Edg-6)
GeneName	S1PR4 EDG6
Length	384
Function	Receptor for the lysosphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is a bioactive lysophospholipid that elicits diverse physiological effect on most types of cells and tissues. May be involved in cell migration processes that are specific for lymphocytes.
