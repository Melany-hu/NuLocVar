UniprotID	P18085
Accession	P18085;B2R7J7;P21371
EntryName	ARF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor 4
GeneName	ARF4 ARF2
Length	180
Function	GTP-binding protein that functions as an allosteric activator of the cholera toxin catalytic subunit, an ADP-ribosyltransferase. Involved in protein trafficking; may modulate vesicle budding and uncoating within the Golgi apparatus. Part of the ciliary targeting complex containing Rab11, ASAP1, Rabin8/RAB3IP, RAB11FIP3 and ARF4, which direct preciliary vesicle trafficking to mother centriole and ciliogenesis initiation (PubMed:25673879).
