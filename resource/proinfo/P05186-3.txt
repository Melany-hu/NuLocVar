ProteinName	Alkaline phosphatase, tissue-nonspecific isozyme (AP-TNAP) (TNS-ALP) (TNSALP) (EC 3.1.3.1) (Alkaline phosphatase liver/bone/kidney isozyme) (Phosphoamidase) (Phosphocreatine phosphatase) (EC 3.9.1.1)
GeneName	ALPL
Length	469
Function	Alkaline phosphatase that metabolizes various phosphate compounds and plays a key role in skeletal mineralization and adaptive thermogenesis (PubMed:12162492, PubMed:23688511, PubMed:25982064). Has broad substrate specificity and can hydrolyze a considerable variety of compounds: however, only a few substrates, such as diphosphate (inorganic pyrophosphate; PPi), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and N-phosphocreatine are natural substrates (PubMed:12162492, PubMed:2220817). Plays an essential role in skeletal and dental mineralization via its ability to hydrolyze extracellular diphosphate, a potent mineralization inhibitor, to phosphate: it thereby promotes hydroxyapatite crystal formation and increases inorganic phosphate concentration (PubMed:23688511, PubMed:25982064). Acts in a non-redundant manner with PHOSPHO1 in skeletal mineralization: while PHOSPHO1 mediates the initiation of hydroxyapatite crystallization in the matrix vesicles (MVs), ALPL/TNAP catalyzes the spread of hydroxyapatite crystallization in the extracellular matrix (By similarity). Also promotes dephosphorylation of osteopontin (SSP1), an inhibitor of hydroxyapatite crystallization in its phosphorylated state; it is however unclear whether ALPL/TNAP mediates SSP1 dephosphorylation via a direct or indirect manner (By similarity). Catalyzes dephosphorylation of PLP to pyridoxal (PL), the transportable form of vitamin B6, in order to provide a sufficient amount of PLP in the brain, an essential cofactor for enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of diverse neurotransmitters (PubMed:20049532, PubMed:2220817). Additionally, also able to mediate ATP degradation in a stepwise manner to adenosine, thereby regulating the availability of ligands for purinergic receptors (By similarity). Also capable of dephosphorylating microbial products, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as well as other phosphorylated small-molecules, such as poly-inosine:cytosine (poly I:C) (PubMed:28448526). Acts as a key regulator of adaptive thermogenesis as part of the futile creatine cycle: localizes to the mitochondria of thermogenic fat cells and acts by mediating hydrolysis of N-phosphocreatine to initiate a futile cycle of creatine dephosphorylation and phosphorylation (By similarity). During the futile creatine cycle, creatine and N-phosphocreatine are in a futile cycle, which dissipates the high energy charge of N-phosphocreatine as heat without performing any mechanical or chemical work (By similarity).
