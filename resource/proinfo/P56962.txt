Function	SNAREs, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptors, are essential proteins for fusion of cellular membranes. SNAREs localized on opposing membranes assemble to form a trans-SNARE complex, an extended, parallel four alpha-helical bundle that drives membrane fusion (PubMed:23217709, PubMed:25686604, PubMed:28306502). STX17 is a SNARE of the autophagosome involved in autophagy through the direct control of autophagosome membrane fusion with the lysosome membrane (PubMed:23217709, PubMed:25686604, PubMed:28306502, PubMed:28504273). May also play a role in the early secretory pathway where it may maintain the architecture of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment/ERGIC and Golgi and/or regulate transport between the endoplasmic reticulum, the ERGIC and the Golgi (PubMed:21545355).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; COPII-coated vesicle membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Mitochondrion membrane
