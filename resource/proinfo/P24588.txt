EntryName	AKAP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	A-kinase anchor protein 5 (AKAP-5) (A-kinase anchor protein 79 kDa) (AKAP 79) (H21) (cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit II high affinity-binding protein)
GeneName	AKAP5 AKAP79
Length	427
Function	Multivalent scaffold protein that anchors the cAMP-dependent protein kinase/PKA to cytoskeletal and/or organelle-associated proteins, targeting the signal carried by cAMP to specific intracellular effectors (PubMed:1512224). Association with the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) not only regulates beta2-AR signaling pathway, but also the activation by PKA by switching off the beta2-AR signaling cascade. Plays a role in long term synaptic potentiation by regulating protein trafficking from the dendritic recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane and controlling both structural and functional plasticity at excitatory synapses (PubMed:25589740). In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, recruits KCNK2/TREK-1 channel at postsynaptic dense bodies microdomains and converts it to a leak channel no longer sensitive to stimulation by arachidonic acid, acidic pH or mechanical stress, nor inhibited by Gq-coupled receptors but still under the negative control of Gs-coupled receptors (By similarity). Associates with ORAI1 pore-forming subunit of CRAC channels in Ca(2+) signaling microdomains where it recruits NFATC2/NFAT1 and couples store-operated Ca(2+) influx to calmodulin and calcineurin signaling and activation of NFAT-dependent transcriptional responses (PubMed:33941685).
