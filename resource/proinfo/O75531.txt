EntryName	BAF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Barrier-to-autointegration factor (Breakpoint cluster region protein 1) [Cleaved into: Barrier-to-autointegration factor, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	BANF1 BAF BCRG1
Length	89
Function	Non-specific DNA-binding protein that plays key roles in mitotic nuclear reassembly, chromatin organization, DNA damage response, gene expression and intrinsic immunity against foreign DNA (PubMed:10908652, PubMed:11792822, PubMed:12163470, PubMed:18005698, PubMed:25991860, PubMed:28841419, PubMed:31796734, PubMed:32792394). Contains two non-specific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-binding sites which promote DNA cross-bridging (PubMed:9465049). Plays a key role in nuclear membrane reformation at the end of mitosis by driving formation of a single nucleus in a spindle-independent manner (PubMed:28841419). Transiently cross-bridges anaphase chromosomes via its ability to bridge distant DNA sites, leading to the formation of a dense chromatin network at the chromosome ensemble surface that limits membranes to the surface (PubMed:28841419). Also acts as a negative regulator of innate immune activation by restricting CGAS activity toward self-DNA upon acute loss of nuclear membrane integrity (PubMed:32792394). Outcompetes CGAS for DNA-binding, thereby preventing CGAS activation and subsequent damaging autoinflammatory responses (PubMed:32792394). Also involved in DNA damage response: interacts with PARP1 in response to oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of PARP1 (PubMed:31796734). Involved in the recognition of exogenous dsDNA in the cytosol: associates with exogenous dsDNA immediately after its appearance in the cytosol at endosome breakdown and is required to avoid autophagy (PubMed:25991860). In case of poxvirus infection, has an antiviral activity by blocking viral DNA replication (PubMed:18005698).
