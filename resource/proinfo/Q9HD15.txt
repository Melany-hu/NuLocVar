UniprotID	Q9HD15
Accession	Q9HD15;Q6NVU9;Q8IXM1;Q9HD13;Q9HD14
EntryName	SRA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Steroid receptor RNA activator 1 (Steroid receptor RNA activator protein) (SRAP)
GeneName	SRA1 PP7684
Length	224
Function	Functional RNA which acts as a transcriptional coactivator that selectively enhances steroid receptor-mediated transactivation ligand-independently through a mechanism involving the modulating N-terminal domain (AF-1) of steroid receptors. Also mediates transcriptional coactivation of steroid receptors ligand-dependently through the steroid-binding domain (AF-2). Enhances cellular proliferation and differentiation and promotes apoptosis in vivo. May play a role in tumorigenesis.
