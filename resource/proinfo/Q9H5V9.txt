UniprotID	Q9H5V9
Accession	Q9H5V9;A8MPX7;B4DQN2;D3DWH9;F5GWL7;O43351
EntryName	STEEP_HUMAN
ProteinName	STING ER exit protein (STEEP)
GeneName	STEEP1 CXorf56
Length	222
Function	Molecular adapter that stimulates membrane curvature formation and subsequent endoplasmic reticulum exit site (ERES) establishment by recruiting PI3K complex I, leading to COPII vesicle-mediated transport (PubMed:32690950). Promotes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit of cGAMP-activated STING1 oligomers (PubMed:32690950, PubMed:37832545).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Nucleus
