EntryName	KMCP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kidney mitochondrial carrier protein 1 (Solute carrier family 25 member 30) (Uncoupling protein 6)
GeneName	SLC25A30 KMCP1 UCP6
Length	291
Function	Antiporter that transports inorganic anions (sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate and phosphate) and, to a lesser extent, a variety of dicarboxylates (e.g. malonate, malate and citramalate) and, even more so, aspartate (PubMed:31356773). The sulfate/sulfate exchange is much higher than the phosphate/phosphate and malate/malate exchanges (PubMed:31356773). The transport affinities is higher for sulfate and thiosulfate than for any other substrate (PubMed:31356773). May catalyze the export of sulfite and thiosulfate (the hydrogen sulfide degradation products) from the mitochondria, thereby modulating the level of the hydrogen sulfide (Probable). Also may mediate a very low unidirectional transport of sulfate, phosphate and (S)-malate (PubMed:31356773).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
