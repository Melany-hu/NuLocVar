UniprotID	P56748
Accession	P56748;D3DSE3;Q53EX7
EntryName	CLD8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Claudin-8
GeneName	CLDN8 UNQ779/PRO1573
Length	225
Function	Can associate with other claudins to regulate tight junction structural and functional strand dynamics (By similarity). May coassemble with CLDN4 into tight junction strands containing anion-selective channels that convey paracellular chloride permeability in renal collecting ducts (By similarity) (PubMed:36008380). Cannot form tight junction strands on its own (PubMed:36008380).
Subcellular Location	Cell junction; Tight junction; Cell membrane
