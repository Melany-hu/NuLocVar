UniprotID	O43347
Accession	O43347;Q96PU0;Q96PU1;Q96PU2;Q96PU3
EntryName	MSI1H_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA-binding protein Musashi homolog 1 (Musashi-1)
GeneName	MSI1
Length	362
Function	RNA binding protein that regulates the expression of target mRNAs at the translation level. Regulates expression of the NOTCH1 antagonist NUMB. Binds RNA containing the sequence 5'-GUUAGUUAGUUAGUU-3' and other sequences containing the pattern 5'-U(1-3)AGU-3'. May play a role in the proliferation and maintenance of stem cells in the central nervous system (By similarity).
