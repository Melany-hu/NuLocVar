ProteinName	Gap junction gamma-2 protein (Connexin-46.6) (Cx46.6) (Connexin-47) (Cx47) (Gap junction alpha-12 protein)
GeneName	GJC2 GJA12
Length	439
Function	One gap junction consists of a cluster of closely packed pairs of transmembrane channels, the connexons, through which materials of low MW diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell. May play a role in myelination in central and peripheral nervous systems.
