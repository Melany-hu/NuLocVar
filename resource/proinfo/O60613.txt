UniprotID	O60613
Accession	O60613;A0A0B4J1S4;Q4GZG7;Q8WU00;Q9BS64;Q9GZW0;Q9NR01
EntryName	SEP15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Selenoprotein F (15 kDa selenoprotein)
GeneName	SELENOF SEP15
Length	165
Function	May be involved in redox reactions associated with the formation of disulfide bonds (By similarity). May contribute to the quality control of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:24415556). May regulate protein folding by enhancing the catalytic activity of UGGT1/UGCGL1 and UGGT2/UGCGL2 (PubMed:24415556).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum lumen
