EntryName	RHAG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ammonium transporter Rh type A (Erythrocyte membrane glycoprotein Rh50) (Erythrocyte plasma membrane 50 kDa glycoprotein) (Rh50A) (Rhesus blood group family type A glycoprotein) (Rh family type A glycoprotein) (Rh type A glycoprotein) (Rhesus blood group-associated ammonia channel) (Rhesus blood group-associated glycoprotein) (CD antigen CD241)
GeneName	RHAG RH50
Length	409
Function	Component of the ankyrin-1 complex, a multiprotein complex involved in the stability and shape of the erythrocyte membrane (PubMed:35835865). Heterotrimer with RHCE (RHAG)2(RHCE), that transports ammonium and its related derivative methylammonium, in both neutral and ionic forms, across the erythrocyte membrane (PubMed:11062476, PubMed:11861637, PubMed:15572441, PubMed:15856280, PubMed:19273840, PubMed:21849667, PubMed:22012326, PubMed:24077989, PubMed:26354748). The transport of NH4(+) is electrogenic and masks the NH3 transport (PubMed:26354748). Also, may act as a CO2 channel (PubMed:17712059, PubMed:19273840, PubMed:24077989). In vitro, leaks monovalent cations (PubMed:18931342, PubMed:21849667). Moreover in erythrocyte, regulates RHD membrane expression (PubMed:12130520) and is associated with rhesus blood group antigen expression (PubMed:12130520, PubMed:19744193).
