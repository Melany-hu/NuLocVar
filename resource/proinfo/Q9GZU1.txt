Function	Nonselective cation channel probably playing a role in the regulation of membrane trafficking events and of metal homeostasis (PubMed:11013137, PubMed:12459486, PubMed:14749347, PubMed:15336987, PubMed:18794901, PubMed:25720963, PubMed:27623384, PubMed:29019983). Acts as a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel with inwardly rectifying activity (PubMed:25720963, PubMed:29019983). Proposed to play a major role in Ca(2+) release from late endosome and lysosome vesicles to the cytoplasm, which is important for many lysosome-dependent cellular events, including the fusion and trafficking of these organelles, exocytosis and autophagy (PubMed:11013137, PubMed:12459486, PubMed:14749347, PubMed:15336987, PubMed:25720963, PubMed:27623384, PubMed:29019983). Required for efficient uptake of large particles in macrophages in which Ca(2+) release from the lysosomes triggers lysosomal exocytosis. May also play a role in phagosome-lysosome fusion (By similarity). Involved in lactosylceramide trafficking indicative for a role in the regulation of late endocytic membrane fusion/fission events (PubMed:16978393). By mediating lysosomal Ca(2+) release is involved in regulation of mTORC1 signaling and in mTOR/TFEB-dependent lysosomal adaptation to environmental cues such as nutrient levels (PubMed:25720963, PubMed:25733853, PubMed:27787197). Seems to act as lysosomal active oxygen species (ROS) sensor involved in ROS-induced TFEB activation and autophagy (PubMed:27357649). Also functions as a Fe(2+) permeable channel in late endosomes and lysosomes (PubMed:18794901). Also permeable to Mg(2+), Na(+). K(+) and Cs(+) (By similarity). Proposed to play a role in zinc homeostasis probably implicating its association with TMEM163 (PubMed:25130899) In adaptive immunity, TRPML2 and TRPML1 may play redundant roles in the function of the specialized lysosomes of B cells (By similarity).
