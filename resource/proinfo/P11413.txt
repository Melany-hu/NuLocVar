UniprotID	P11413
Accession	P11413;D3DWX9;Q16000;Q16765;Q8IU70;Q8IU88;Q8IUA6;Q96PQ2
EntryName	G6PD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (G6PD) (EC 1.1.1.49)
GeneName	G6PD
Length	515
Function	Catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway, which represents a route for the dissimilation of carbohydrates besides glycolysis. The main function of this enzyme is to provide reducing power (NADPH) and pentose phosphates for fatty acid and nucleic acid synthesis.
