UniprotID	Q12904
Accession	Q12904;B3KTR2;B4E1S7;Q6FG28;Q96CQ9
EntryName	AIMP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aminoacyl tRNA synthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1 (Multisynthase complex auxiliary component p43) [Cleaved into: Endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide 2 (EMAP-2) (Endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide II) (EMAP-II) (Small inducible cytokine subfamily E member 1)]
GeneName	AIMP1 EMAP2 SCYE1
Length	312
Function	Non-catalytic component of the multisynthase complex. Stimulates the catalytic activity of cytoplasmic arginyl-tRNA synthase (PubMed:10358004). Binds tRNA. Possesses inflammatory cytokine activity (PubMed:11306575). Negatively regulates TGF-beta signaling through stabilization of SMURF2 by binding to SMURF2 and inhibiting its SMAD7-mediated degradation (By similarity). Involved in glucose homeostasis through induction of glucagon secretion at low glucose levels (By similarity). Promotes dermal fibroblast proliferation and wound repair (PubMed:16472771). Regulates KDELR1-mediated retention of HSP90B1/gp96 in the endoplasmic reticulum (By similarity). Plays a role in angiogenesis by inducing endothelial cell migration at low concentrations and endothelian cell apoptosis at high concentrations (PubMed:12237313). Induces maturation of dendritic cells and monocyte cell adhesion (PubMed:11818442). Modulates endothelial cell responses by degrading HIF-1A through interaction with PSMA7 (PubMed:19362550).
