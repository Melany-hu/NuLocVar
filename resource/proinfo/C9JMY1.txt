UniprotID	C9JMY1
Accession	C9JMY1
EntryName	C9JMY1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2
GeneName	IGFBP2
Length	181
Function	Multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in regulating the availability of IGFs such as IGF1 and IGF2 to their receptors and thereby regulates IGF-mediated cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in a cell-type specific manner. Functions coordinately with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/PTPRB and the IGF1 receptor to regulate IGF1-mediated signaling by stimulating the phosphorylation of PTEN leading to its inactivation and AKT1 activation. Plays a positive role in cell migration via interaction with integrin alpha5/ITGA5 through an RGD motif. Additionally, interaction with ITGA5/ITGB1 enhances the adhesion of endothelial progenitor cells to endothelial cells. Upon mitochondrial damage, facilitates apoptosis with ITGA5 of podocytes, and then activates the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-mediated mitochondrial injury.
