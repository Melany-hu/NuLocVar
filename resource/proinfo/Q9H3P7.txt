UniprotID	Q9H3P7
Accession	Q9H3P7;B2RB29;Q5VTJ0;Q6P9F1;Q8IZC5;Q8N4D6;Q9H6U3
EntryName	GCP60_HUMAN
ProteinName	Golgi resident protein GCP60 (Acyl-CoA-binding domain-containing protein 3) (Golgi complex-associated protein 1) (GOCAP1) (Golgi phosphoprotein 1) (GOLPH1) (PBR- and PKA-associated protein 7) (Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein PAP7) [Cleaved into: Golgi resident protein GCP60, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	ACBD3 GCP60 GOCAP1 GOLPH1
Length	528
Function	Involved in the maintenance of Golgi structure by interacting with giantin, affecting protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (PubMed:11590181). Involved in hormone-induced steroid biosynthesis in testicular Leydig cells (By similarity). Recruits PI4KB to the Golgi apparatus membrane; enhances the enzyme activity of PI4KB activity via its membrane recruitment thereby increasing the local concentration of the substrate in the vicinity of the kinase (PubMed:27009356).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Mitochondrion
