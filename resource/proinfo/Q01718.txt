UniprotID	Q01718
Accession	Q01718;A8K016;Q3MI45;Q504X6
EntryName	ACTHR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor (ACTH receptor) (ACTH-R) (Adrenocorticotropin receptor) (Melanocortin receptor 2) (MC2-R)
GeneName	MC2R ACTHR
Length	297
Function	Hormone receptor primarily expressed in adrenal cortex that plays a key role in regulating adrenocortical function (PubMed:36588120). Upon corticotropin (ACTH) binding, facilitates the release of adrenal glucocorticoids, including cortisol and corticosterone. In addition, MC2R is required for fetal and neonatal adrenal gland development (By similarity). Mechanistically, activates adenylate cyclase (cAMP), the MAPK cascade as well as the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway leading to steroidogenic factor 1/NR5A1-mediated transcriptional activation (By similarity).
