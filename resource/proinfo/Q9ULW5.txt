UniprotID	Q9ULW5
Accession	Q9ULW5;B2RAA6;Q3L6K5;Q6NXS7
EntryName	RAB26_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-26 (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB26
Length	256
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different set of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (By similarity). RAB26 mediates transport of ADRA2A and ADRA2B from the Golgi to the cell membrane (PubMed:23105096). Plays a role in the maturation of zymogenic granules and in pepsinogen secretion in the stomach (PubMed:20038531). Plays a role in the secretion of amylase from acinar granules in the parotid gland (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle membrane
