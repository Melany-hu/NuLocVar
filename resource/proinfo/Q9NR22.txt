UniprotID	Q9NR22
Accession	Q9NR22;B2RDP0;Q8TBJ8
EntryName	ANM8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein arginine N-methyltransferase 8 (EC 2.1.1.319) (Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein methyltransferase-like protein 4)
GeneName	PRMT8 HRMT1L3 HRMT1L4
Length	394
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent and membrane-associated arginine methyltransferase that can both catalyze the formation of omega-N monomethylarginine (MMA) and asymmetrical dimethylarginine (aDMA) in proteins such as NIFK, myelin basic protein, histone H4, H2A and H2A/H2B dimer (PubMed:16051612, PubMed:17925405, PubMed:26529540, PubMed:26876602). Able to mono- and dimethylate EWS protein; however its precise role toward EWS remains unclear as it still interacts with fully methylated EWS (PubMed:18320585).
