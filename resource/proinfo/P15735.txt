UniprotID	P15735
Accession	P15735;A8K0C7;B4DEB7;E9PEU3;P11800
EntryName	PHKG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphorylase b kinase gamma catalytic chain, liver/testis isoform (PHK-gamma-LT) (PHK-gamma-T) (EC 2.7.11.19) (PSK-C3) (Phosphorylase kinase subunit gamma-2)
GeneName	PHKG2
Length	406
Function	Catalytic subunit of the phosphorylase b kinase (PHK), which mediates the neural and hormonal regulation of glycogen breakdown (glycogenolysis) by phosphorylating and thereby activating glycogen phosphorylase. May regulate glycogeneolysis in the testis. In vitro, phosphorylates PYGM (PubMed:35549678).
