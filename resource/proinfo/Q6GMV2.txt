ProteinName	Protein-lysine N-trimethyltransferase SMYD5 (EC 2.1.1.-) (Protein NN8-4AG) (Retinoic acid-induced protein 15) (SET and MYND domain-containing protein 5) ([histone H3]-lysine20 N-trimethyltransferase SMYD5) (EC 2.1.1.372) ([histone H4]-lysine36 N-trimethyltransferase SMYD5) (EC 2.1.1.359)
GeneName	SMYD5 RAI15
Length	418
Function	Protein-lysine N-trimethyltransferase that specifically catalyzes trimethylation of 'Lys-22' of the RPL40/eL40 subunit of the 60S ribosome, thereby promoting translation elongation and protein synthesis (PubMed:39048817, PubMed:39103523). May also act as a histone methyltransferase in the context of histone octamers, but not on nucleosome substrates: trimethylates 'Lys-36' of histone H3 and 'Lys-20' of histone H4 to form H3K36me3 and H4K20me3, respectively (By similarity). The histone methyltransferase activity, which is independent of its SET domain, is however unsure in vivo (PubMed:39048817, PubMed:39103523). In association with the NCoR corepressor complex, involved in the repression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-target inflammatory genes in macrophages, possibly by catalyzing the formation of H4K20me3 at the gene promoters (By similarity). Plays an important role in embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal and differentiation (By similarity). Maintains genome stability of ES cells during differentiation through regulation of heterochromatin formation and repression of endogenous repetitive DNA elements by promoting H4K20me3 marks (PubMed:28951459). Acts as a regulator of the hypothermia response: its degradation in response to mild hypothermia relieves the formation of H3K36me3 at gene promoters, allowing expression of the neuroprotective gene SP1 (By similarity).
