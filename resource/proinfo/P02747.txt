UniprotID	P02747
Accession	P02747;Q7Z502;Q96DL2;Q96H05
EntryName	C1QC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complement C1q subcomponent subunit C
GeneName	C1QC C1QG
Length	245
Function	C1q associates with the proenzymes C1r and C1s to yield C1, the first component of the serum complement system. The collagen-like regions of C1q interact with the Ca(2+)-dependent C1r(2)C1s(2) proenzyme complex, and efficient activation of C1 takes place on interaction of the globular heads of C1q with the Fc regions of IgG or IgM antibody present in immune complexes.
