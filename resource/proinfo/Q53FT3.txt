UniprotID	Q53FT3
Accession	Q53FT3;Q8WVE8;Q9NVQ2;Q9NZZ1;Q9P022;Q9P0N1
EntryName	HIKES_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Hikeshi
GeneName	HIKESHI C11orf73 HSPC138 HSPC179 HSPC248
Length	197
Function	Acts as a specific nuclear import carrier for HSP70 proteins following heat-shock stress: acts by mediating the nucleoporin-dependent translocation of ATP-bound HSP70 proteins into the nucleus. HSP70 proteins import is required to protect cells from heat shock damages. Does not translocate ADP-bound HSP70 proteins into the nucleus.
