UniprotID	Q6P4I2
Accession	Q6P4I2;Q96JZ1;Q9P0B7
EntryName	WDR73_HUMAN
ProteinName	Integrator complex assembly factor WDR73 (WD repeat-containing protein 73)
GeneName	WDR73 HSPC264
Length	378
Function	Component of a multiprotein complex required for the assembly of the RNA endonuclease module of the integrator complex (PubMed:39032489). Associates with INTS9 and INTS11 in the cytoplasm, stabilizing the INTS9-INTS11 heterodimer and blocking the active site of INTS11 (PubMed:39032489). BRAT1 then joins the complex and plugs the active site of INTS11, leading to WDR73 release and nuclear import of INTS9 and INTS11 (PubMed:39032489).
