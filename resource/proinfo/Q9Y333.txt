UniprotID	Q9Y333
Accession	Q9Y333;Q6FGG1
EntryName	LSM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	U6 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein LSm2 (Protein G7b) (Small nuclear ribonuclear protein D homolog) (snRNP core Sm-like protein Sm-x5)
GeneName	LSM2 C6orf28 G7B
Length	95
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing as component of the U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP complex that is involved in spliceosome assembly, and as component of the precatalytic spliceosome (spliceosome B complex) (PubMed:28781166). The heptameric LSM2-8 complex binds specifically to the 3'-terminal U-tract of U6 snRNA (PubMed:10523320).
