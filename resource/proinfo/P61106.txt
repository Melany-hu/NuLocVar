Accession	P61106;B3KR31;P35287;Q5JVD4;Q6Q7K5;Q969L0;Q9UI11
EntryName	RAB14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-14 (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB14
Length	215
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different set of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (PubMed:22595670). Involved in membrane trafficking between the Golgi complex and endosomes during early embryonic development (By similarity). Regulates the Golgi to endosome transport of FGFR-containing vesicles during early development, a key process for developing basement membrane and epiblast and primitive endoderm lineages during early postimplantation development. May act by modulating the kinesin KIF16B-cargo association to endosomes (By similarity). Regulates, together with its guanine nucleotide exchange factor DENND6A, the specific endocytic transport of ADAM10, N-cadherin/CDH2 shedding and cell-cell adhesion (PubMed:22595670). Mediates endosomal tethering and fusion through the interaction with RUFY1 and RAB4B (PubMed:20534812). Interaction with RAB11FIP1 may function in the process of neurite formation (PubMed:26032412).
