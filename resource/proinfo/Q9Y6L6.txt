UniprotID	Q9Y6L6
Accession	Q9Y6L6;B2R7G2;Q29R64;Q9NQ37;Q9UBF3;Q9UH89
EntryName	SO1B1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) (Liver-specific organic anion transporter 1) (LST-1) (OATP-C) (Organic anion transporter SLC21A6) (Sodium-independent organic anion-transporting polypeptide 2) (OATP-2) (Solute carrier family 21 member 6)
GeneName	SLCO1B1 LST1 OATP1B1 OATP2 OATPC SLC21A6
Length	691
Function	Mediates the Na(+)-independent uptake of organic anions (PubMed:10358072, PubMed:15159445, PubMed:17412826). Shows broad substrate specificity, can transport both organic anions such as bile acid taurocholate (cholyltaurine) and conjugated steroids (dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate, 17-beta-glucuronosyl estradiol, and estrone 3-sulfate), as well as eicosanoids (prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2, leukotriene C4, and leukotriene E4), and thyroid hormones (T4/L-thyroxine, and T3/3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine) (PubMed:10358072, PubMed:10601278, PubMed:10873595, PubMed:11159893, PubMed:12196548, PubMed:12568656, PubMed:15159445, PubMed:15970799, PubMed:16627748, PubMed:17412826, PubMed:19129463, PubMed:26979622). Can take up bilirubin glucuronides from plasma into the liver, contributing to the detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttling loop (PubMed:22232210). Involved in the clearance of endogenous and exogenous substrates from the liver (PubMed:10358072, PubMed:10601278). Transports coproporphyrin I and III, by-products of heme synthesis, and may be involved in their hepatic disposition (PubMed:26383540). May contribute to regulate the transport of organic compounds in testes across the blood-testis-barrier (Probable). Can transport HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (also known as statins), such as pravastatin and pitavastatin, a clinically important class of hypolipidemic drugs (PubMed:10601278, PubMed:15159445, PubMed:15970799). May play an important role in plasma and tissue distribution of the structurally diverse chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate (PubMed:23243220). May also transport antihypertension agents, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prodrug enalapril, and the highly selective angiotensin II AT1-receptor antagonist valsartan, in the liver (PubMed:16624871, PubMed:16627748). Shows a pH-sensitive substrate specificity towards prostaglandin E2 and T4 which may be ascribed to the protonation state of the binding site and leads to a stimulation of substrate transport in an acidic microenvironment (PubMed:19129463). Hydrogencarbonate/HCO3(-) acts as the probable counteranion that exchanges for organic anions (PubMed:19129463).
