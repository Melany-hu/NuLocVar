UniprotID	Q15573
Accession	Q15573;B2RDZ8;D3DTB7;Q9NWA1
EntryName	TAF1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	TATA box-binding protein-associated factor RNA polymerase I subunit A (RNA polymerase I-specific TBP-associated factor 48 kDa) (TAFI48) (TATA box-binding protein-associated factor 1A) (TBP-associated factor 1A) (Transcription factor SL1) (Transcription initiation factor SL1/TIF-IB subunit A)
GeneName	TAF1A
Length	450
Function	Component of the transcription factor SL1/TIF-IB complex, which is involved in the assembly of the PIC (pre-initiation complex) during RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription. The rate of PIC formation probably is primarily dependent on the rate of association of SL1/TIF-IB with the rDNA promoter. SL1/TIF-IB is involved in stabilization of nucleolar transcription factor 1/UBTF on rDNA. Formation of SL1/TIF-IB excludes the association of TBP with TFIID subunits.
