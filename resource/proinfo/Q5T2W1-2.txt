UniprotID	Q5T2W1-2
Accession	Q5T2W1;B4DPB9;E7EU02;O60450;Q5T5P6;Q9BQ41
EntryName	NHRF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Na(+)/H(+) exchange regulatory cofactor NHE-RF3 (NHERF-3) (CFTR-associated protein of 70 kDa) (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor 3) (Na/Pi cotransporter C-terminal-associated protein 1) (NaPi-Cap1) (PDZ domain-containing protein 1) (Sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor 3)
GeneName	PDZK1 CAP70 NHERF3 PDZD1
Length	408
Function	A scaffold protein that connects plasma membrane proteins and regulatory components, regulating their surface expression in epithelial cells apical domains. May be involved in the coordination of a diverse range of regulatory processes for ion transport and second messenger cascades. In complex with NHERF1, may cluster proteins that are functionally dependent in a mutual fashion and modulate the trafficking and the activity of the associated membrane proteins. May play a role in the cellular mechanisms associated with multidrug resistance through its interaction with ABCC2 and PDZK1IP1. May potentiate the CFTR chloride channel activity. Required for normal cell-surface expression of SCARB1. Plays a role in maintaining normal plasma cholesterol levels via its effects on SCARB1. Plays a role in the normal localization and function of the chloride-anion exchanger SLC26A6 to the plasma membrane in the brush border of the proximal tubule of the kidney. May be involved in the regulation of proximal tubular Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransport therefore playing an important role in tubule function (By similarity).
