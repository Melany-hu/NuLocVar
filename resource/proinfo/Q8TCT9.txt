EntryName	HM13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Minor histocompatibility antigen H13 (EC 3.4.23.-) (Intramembrane protease 1) (IMP-1) (IMPAS-1) (hIMP1) (Presenilin-like protein 3) (Signal peptide peptidase)
GeneName	HM13 H13 IMP1 PSL3 SPP MSTP086
Length	377
Function	Catalyzes intramembrane proteolysis of some signal peptides after they have been cleaved from a preprotein, resulting in the release of the fragment from the ER membrane into the cytoplasm. Required to generate lymphocyte cell surface (HLA-E) epitopes derived from MHC class I signal peptides (PubMed:11714810). May be necessary for the removal of the signal peptide that remains attached to the hepatitis C virus core protein after the initial proteolytic processing of the polyprotein (PubMed:12145199). Involved in the intramembrane cleavage of the integral membrane protein PSEN1 (PubMed:11714810, PubMed:12077416, PubMed:14741365). Cleaves the integral membrane protein XBP1 isoform 1 in a DERL1/RNF139-dependent manner (PubMed:25239945). May play a role in graft rejection (By similarity).
