UniprotID	Q92886
Accession	Q92886;Q5U0Q9;Q96HE1
EntryName	NGN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neurogenin-1 (NGN-1) (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 6) (bHLHa6) (Neurogenic basic-helix-loop-helix protein) (Neurogenic differentiation factor 3) (NeuroD3)
GeneName	NEUROG1 BHLHA6 NEUROD3 NGN NGN1
Length	237
Function	Acts as a transcriptional regulator. Involved in the initiation of neuronal differentiation. Activates transcription by binding to the E box (5'-CANNTG-3'). Associates with chromatin to enhancer regulatory elements in genes encoding key transcriptional regulators of neurogenesis (By similarity).
