UniprotID	O43677
Accession	O43677;A8K532;Q3MIJ9
EntryName	NDUC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 subunit C1, mitochondrial (Complex I-KFYI) (CI-KFYI) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase KFYI subunit)
GeneName	NDUFC1
Length	76
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
