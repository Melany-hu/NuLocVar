EntryName	ABD12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysophosphatidylserine lipase ABHD12 (EC 3.1.-.-) (2-arachidonoylglycerol hydrolase ABHD12) (Abhydrolase domain-containing protein 12) (hABHD12) (Monoacylglycerol lipase ABHD12) (EC 3.1.1.23) (Oxidized phosphatidylserine lipase ABHD12) (EC 3.1.-.-)
GeneName	ABHD12 C20orf22
Length	398
Function	Lysophosphatidylserine (LPS) lipase that mediates the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylserine, a class of signaling lipids that regulates immunological and neurological processes (PubMed:25290914, PubMed:30237167, PubMed:30420694, PubMed:30643283, PubMed:30720278). Represents a major lysophosphatidylserine lipase in the brain, thereby playing a key role in the central nervous system (By similarity). Also able to hydrolyze oxidized phosphatidylserine; oxidized phosphatidylserine is produced in response to severe inflammatory stress and constitutes a proapoptotic 'eat me' signal (PubMed:30643283). Also has monoacylglycerol (MAG) lipase activity: hydrolyzes 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), thereby acting as a regulator of endocannabinoid signaling pathways (PubMed:22969151, PubMed:24027063). Has a strong preference for very-long-chain lipid substrates; substrate specificity is likely due to improved catalysis and not improved substrate binding (PubMed:30237167).
