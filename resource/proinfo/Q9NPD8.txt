UniprotID	Q9NPD8
Accession	Q9NPD8;Q2TU36
EntryName	UBE2T_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 T (EC 2.3.2.23) (Cell proliferation-inducing gene 50 protein) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme T) (Ubiquitin carrier protein T) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase T)
GeneName	UBE2T HSPC150 PIG50
Length	197
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. Catalyzes monoubiquitination. Involved in mitomycin-C (MMC)-induced DNA repair. Acts as a specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme for the Fanconi anemia complex by associating with E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase FANCL and catalyzing monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key step in the DNA damage pathway (PubMed:16916645, PubMed:17938197, PubMed:19111657, PubMed:19589784, PubMed:28437106). Also mediates monoubiquitination of FANCL and FANCI (PubMed:16916645, PubMed:17938197, PubMed:19111657, PubMed:19589784). May contribute to ubiquitination and degradation of BRCA1 (PubMed:19887602). In vitro able to promote polyubiquitination using all 7 ubiquitin Lys residues, but may prefer 'Lys-11'-, 'Lys-27'-, 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:20061386).
