UniprotID	Q6ZPD8
Accession	Q6ZPD8;Q6IEE2
EntryName	DG2L6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2-like protein 6 (EC 2.3.1.-) (Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase candidate 3) (hDC3)
GeneName	DGAT2L6 DC3
Length	337
Function	Diglyceride acyltransferase that uses fatty acyl-CoA as substrate (PubMed:15671038). Particularly active with oleate as a substrate (PubMed:15671038). Has no wax synthase activity to produce wax esters (PubMed:15671038). Able to use 1-monoalkylglycerol (1-MAkG) as an acyl acceptor for the synthesis of monoalkyl-monoacylglycerol (MAMAG) (PubMed:28420705).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
