UniprotID	Q04771
Accession	Q04771
EntryName	ACVR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Activin receptor type-1 (EC 2.7.11.30) (Activin receptor type I) (ACTR-I) (Activin receptor-like kinase 2) (ALK-2) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase receptor R1) (SKR1) (TGF-B superfamily receptor type I) (TSR-I)
GeneName	ACVR1 ACVRLK2
Length	509
Function	Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor that is involved in a wide variety of biological processes, including bone, heart, cartilage, nervous, and reproductive system development and regulation (PubMed:20628059, PubMed:22977237). As a type I receptor, forms heterotetrameric receptor complexes with the type II receptors AMHR2, ACVR2A or ACVR2B (PubMed:17911401). Upon binding of ligands such as BMP7 or GDF2/BMP9 to the heteromeric complexes, type II receptors transphosphorylate ACVR1 intracellular domain (PubMed:25354296). In turn, ACVR1 kinase domain is activated and subsequently phosphorylates SMAD1/5/8 proteins that transduce the signal (PubMed:9748228). In addition to its role in mediating BMP pathway-specific signaling, suppresses TGFbeta/activin pathway signaling by interfering with the binding of activin to its type II receptor (PubMed:17911401). Besides canonical SMAD signaling, can activate non-canonical pathways such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases/MAPKs (By similarity). May promote the expression of HAMP, potentially via its interaction with BMP6 (By similarity).
