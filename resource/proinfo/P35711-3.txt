EntryName	SOX5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor SOX-5
GeneName	SOX5
Length	377
Function	Transcription factor involved in chondrocytes differentiation and cartilage formation. Specifically binds the 5'-AACAAT-3' DNA motif present in enhancers and super-enhancers and promotes expression of genes important for chondrogenesis, including cartilage matrix protein-coding genes, such as COL2A1 and AGC1. Required for overt chondrogenesis when condensed prechondrocytes differentiate into early stage chondrocytes: SOX5 and SOX6 cooperatively bind with SOX9 on active enhancers and super-enhancers associated with cartilage-specific genes, and thereby potentiate SOX9's ability to transactivate. Not involved in precartilaginous condensation, the first step in chondrogenesis, during which skeletal progenitors differentiate into prechondrocytes. Together with SOX6, required to form and maintain a pool of highly proliferating chondroblasts between epiphyses and metaphyses, to form columnar chondroblasts, delay chondrocyte prehypertrophy but promote hypertrophy, and to delay terminal differentiation of chondrocytes on contact with ossification fronts. Binds to the proximal promoter region of the myelin protein MPZ gene.
