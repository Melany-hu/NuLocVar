UniprotID	O75208
Accession	O75208;A8K3L2;Q7L5V7;Q7Z5T6;Q8NBL4;Q9NTJ2;Q9P056
EntryName	COQ9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquinone biosynthesis protein COQ9, mitochondrial
GeneName	COQ9 C16orf49 HSPC326 PSEC0129
Length	318
Function	Membrane-associated protein that warps the membrane surface to access and bind aromatic isoprenes with high specificity, including ubiquinone (CoQ) isoprene intermediates and presents them directly to COQ7, therefore facilitating the COQ7-mediated hydroxylase step (PubMed:25339443, PubMed:30661980, PubMed:38425362). Participates in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q, also named ubiquinone, an essential lipid-soluble electron transporter for aerobic cellular respiration (PubMed:25339443, PubMed:30661980).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
