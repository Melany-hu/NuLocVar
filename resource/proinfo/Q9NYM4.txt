EntryName	GPR83_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 83 (G-protein coupled receptor 72)
GeneName	GPR83 GPR72 JP05 KIAA1540
Length	423
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for PEN, a neuropeptide produced from the precursor protein, proSAAS (encoded by PCSK1N). Acts through a G(i)- and G(q)-alpha-alpha-mediated pathway in response to PEN (PubMed:27117253). Plays a role in food intake and body weight regulation. May contribute to the regulation of anxiety-related behaviors (By similarity).
