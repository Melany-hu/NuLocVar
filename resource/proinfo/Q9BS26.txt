UniprotID	Q9BS26
Accession	Q9BS26;O60319;Q4VXC1;Q5VWZ7;Q6UW14;Q8WX67
EntryName	ERP44_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 44 (ER protein 44) (ERp44) (Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 4)
GeneName	ERP44 KIAA0573 TXNDC4 UNQ532/PRO1075
Length	406
Function	Mediates thiol-dependent retention in the early secretory pathway, forming mixed disulfides with substrate proteins through its conserved CRFS motif (PubMed:11847130, PubMed:14517240). Inhibits the calcium channel activity of ITPR1 (PubMed:15652484). May have a role in the control of oxidative protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:11847130, PubMed:14517240, PubMed:29858230). Required to retain ERO1A and ERO1B in the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:11847130, PubMed:29858230).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum lumen
