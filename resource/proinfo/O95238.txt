UniprotID	O95238
Accession	O95238;B4DWH8;F5H778
EntryName	SPDEF_HUMAN
ProteinName	SAM pointed domain-containing Ets transcription factor (Prostate epithelium-specific Ets transcription factor) (Prostate-specific Ets) (Prostate-derived Ets factor)
GeneName	SPDEF PDEF PSE
Length	335
Function	May function as an androgen-independent transactivator of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter. Binds to 5'-GGAT-3' DNA sequences. May play a role in the regulation of the prostate gland and/or prostate cancer development. Acts as a transcriptional activator for SERPINB5 promoter.
