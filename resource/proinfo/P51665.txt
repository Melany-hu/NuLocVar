UniprotID	P51665
Accession	P51665;D3DWS9;Q6PKI2;Q96E97
EntryName	PSMD7_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 7 (26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN8) (26S proteasome regulatory subunit S12) (Mov34 protein homolog) (Proteasome subunit p40)
GeneName	PSMD7 MOV34L
Length	324
Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair.
