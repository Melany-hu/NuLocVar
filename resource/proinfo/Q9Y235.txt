UniprotID	Q9Y235
Accession	Q9Y235;B2R899;Q53F28;Q5TGU5;Q5TGU6
EntryName	ABEC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	C->U-editing enzyme APOBEC-2 (EC 3.5.4.36) (mRNA(cytosine(6666)) deaminase 2)
GeneName	APOBEC2
Length	224
Function	Probable C to U editing enzyme whose physiological substrate is not yet known. Does not display detectable apoB mRNA editing. Has a low intrinsic cytidine deaminase activity. May play a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through the process of active DNA demethylation.
