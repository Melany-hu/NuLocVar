UniprotID	Q15796-2
Accession	Q15796
EntryName	SMAD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (MAD homolog 2) (Mothers against DPP homolog 2) (JV18-1) (Mad-related protein 2) (hMAD-2) (SMAD family member 2) (SMAD 2) (Smad2) (hSMAD2)
GeneName	SMAD2 MADH2 MADR2
Length	437
Function	Receptor-regulated SMAD (R-SMAD) that is an intracellular signal transducer and transcriptional modulator activated by TGF-beta (transforming growth factor) and activin type 1 receptor kinases. Binds the TRE element in the promoter region of many genes that are regulated by TGF-beta and, on formation of the SMAD2/SMAD4 complex, activates transcription. Promotes TGFB1-mediated transcription of odontoblastic differentiation genes in dental papilla cells (By similarity). Positively regulates PDPK1 kinase activity by stimulating its dissociation from the 14-3-3 protein YWHAQ which acts as a negative regulator. May act as a tumor suppressor in colorectal carcinoma (PubMed:8752209).
