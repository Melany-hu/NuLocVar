UniprotID	Q9NV79
Accession	Q9NV79;E1P5H3;Q8IW60;Q9H4K2
EntryName	PCMD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein-L-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase domain-containing protein 2
GeneName	PCMTD2 C20orf36
Length	361
Function	May act as a substrate recognition component of an ECS (Elongin BC-CUL5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. May bind to the methyltransferase cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) via the N-terminal AdoMet binding motif, but probably does not display methyltransferase activity.
