UniprotID	O43447
Accession	O43447;A6NNE7
EntryName	PPIH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase H (PPIase H) (EC 5.2.1.8) (Rotamase H) (Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle-specific cyclophilin H) (CypH) (U-snRNP-associated cyclophilin SnuCyp-20) (USA-CYP)
GeneName	PPIH CYP20 CYPH
Length	177
Function	PPIase that catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and may therefore assist protein folding (PubMed:20676357). Participates in pre-mRNA splicing. May play a role in the assembly of the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP complex, one of the building blocks of the spliceosome. May act as a chaperone.
