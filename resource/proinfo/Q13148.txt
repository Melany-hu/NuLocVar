EntryName	TADBP_HUMAN
ProteinName	TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)
GeneName	TARDBP TDP43
Length	414
Function	RNA-binding protein that is involved in various steps of RNA biogenesis and processing (PubMed:23519609). Preferentially binds, via its two RNA recognition motifs RRM1 and RRM2, to GU-repeats on RNA molecules predominantly localized within long introns and in the 3'UTR of mRNAs (PubMed:23519609, PubMed:24240615, PubMed:24464995). In turn, regulates the splicing of many non-coding and protein-coding RNAs including proteins involved in neuronal survival, as well as mRNAs that encode proteins relevant for neurodegenerative diseases (PubMed:21358640, PubMed:29438978). Plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis by regulating the processing of mitochondrial transcripts (PubMed:28794432). Also regulates mRNA stability by recruiting CNOT7/CAF1 deadenylase on mRNA 3'UTR leading to poly(A) tail deadenylation and thus shortening (PubMed:30520513). In response to oxidative insult, associates with stalled ribosomes localized to stress granules (SGs) and contributes to cell survival (PubMed:19765185, PubMed:23398327). Also participates in the normal skeletal muscle formation and regeneration, forming cytoplasmic myo-granules and binding mRNAs that encode sarcomeric proteins (PubMed:30464263). Plays a role in the maintenance of the circadian clock periodicity via stabilization of the CRY1 and CRY2 proteins in a FBXL3-dependent manner (PubMed:27123980). Negatively regulates the expression of CDK6 (PubMed:19760257). Regulates the expression of HDAC6, ATG7 and VCP in a PPIA/CYPA-dependent manner (PubMed:25678563).
