EntryName	KCJ10_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 10 (ATP-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1) (Inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir1.2) (Potassium channel, inwardly rectifying subfamily J member 10)
GeneName	KCNJ10
Length	379
Function	May be responsible for potassium buffering action of glial cells in the brain (By similarity). Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it (PubMed:8995301). Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages (PubMed:8995301). The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium. Can be blocked by extracellular barium and cesium (PubMed:8995301). In the kidney, together with KCNJ16, mediates basolateral K(+) recycling in distal tubules; this process is critical for Na(+) reabsorption at the tubules (PubMed:24561201).
