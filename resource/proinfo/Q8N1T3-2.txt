UniprotID	Q8N1T3-2
Accession	Q8N1T3;F5H3C6
EntryName	MYO1H_HUMAN
ProteinName	Unconventional myosin-Ih (Myosin-1H)
GeneName	MYO1H
Length	127
Function	Myosins are actin-based motor molecules with ATPase activity. Unconventional myosins serve in intracellular movements. Their highly divergent tails are presumed to bind to membranous compartments, which would be moved relative to actin filaments (By similarity).
