UniprotID	A0PJY2
Accession	A0PJY2;A0PJY3;A4D0W3;B4DUP9;B7ZM98
EntryName	FEZF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fez family zinc finger protein 1 (Zinc finger protein 312B)
GeneName	FEZF1 FEZ ZNF312B
Length	475
Function	Transcription repressor. Involved in the axonal projection and proper termination of olfactory sensory neurons (OSN). Plays a role in rostro-caudal patterning of the diencephalon and in prethalamic formation. Expression is required in OSN to cell-autonomously regulate OSN axon projections. Regulates non-cell-autonomously the layer formation of the olfactory bulb development and the interneurons. May be required for correct rostral migration of the interneuron progenitors (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
