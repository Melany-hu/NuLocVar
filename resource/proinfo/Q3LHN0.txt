UniprotID	Q3LHN0
Accession	Q3LHN0
EntryName	KR251_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 25-1
GeneName	KRTAP25-1 KAP25.1
Length	102
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins (By similarity).
