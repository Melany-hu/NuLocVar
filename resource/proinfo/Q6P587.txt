EntryName	FAHD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Oxaloacetate tautomerase FAHD1, mitochondrial (EC 5.3.2.2) (Acylpyruvase FAHD1) (EC 3.7.1.5) (Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase domain-containing protein 1) (FAH domain-containing protein 1) (Oxaloacetate decarboxylase) (OAA decarboxylase) (ODx) (EC 4.1.1.112) (YisK-like protein)
GeneName	FAHD1 C16orf36 YISKL
Length	221
Function	Tautomerase that converts enol-oxaloacetate, a strong inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, to the physiological keto form of oxaloacetate (PubMed:38287013). It is thereby required to maximize aerobic respiration efficiency by preventing succinate dehydrogenase inhibition (PubMed:38287013). Also acts as a weak oxaloacetate decarboxylase (ODx), catalyzing the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate (OAA) to pyruvate and CO(2), and as such is likely a regulatory enzyme in the TCA cycle (PubMed:25575590, PubMed:30348641). Also displays acylpyruvase activity, being able to hydrolyze acetylpyruvate and fumarylpyruvate in vitro (PubMed:21878618, PubMed:30348641). Exhibits only a weak hydrolase activity on methylacetopyruvate and acetylacetone, and no activity toward acetoacetyl-CoA (PubMed:21878618).
