EntryName	CGB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Choriogonadotropin subunit beta 3 (Choriogonadotropin subunit beta) (CG-beta) (Chorionic gonadotropin chain beta)
GeneName	CGB3 CGB; CGB5; CGB8
Length	165
Function	Beta subunit of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG is a complex glycoprotein composed of two glycosylated subunits alpha and beta which are non-covalently associated. The alpha subunit is identical to those in the pituitary gonadotropin hormones (LH, FSH and TSH). The beta subunits are distinct in each of the hormones and confer receptor and biological specificity. Has an essential role in pregnancy and maternal adaptation. Stimulates the ovaries to synthesize the steroids that are essential for the maintenance of pregnancy.
