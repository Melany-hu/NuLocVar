UniprotID	P09913
Accession	P09913;Q5T767
EntryName	IFIT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT-2) (ISG-54 K) (Interferon-induced 54 kDa protein) (IFI-54K) (P54)
GeneName	IFIT2 CIG-42 G10P2 IFI54 ISG54
Length	472
Function	IFN-induced antiviral protein which inhibits expression of viral messenger RNAs lacking 2'-O-methylation of the 5' cap. The ribose 2'-O-methylation would provide a molecular signature to distinguish between self and non-self mRNAs by the host during viral infection. Viruses evolved several ways to evade this restriction system such as encoding their own 2'-O-methylase for their mRNAs or by stealing host cap containing the 2'-O-methylation (cap snatching mechanism). Binds AU-rich viral RNAs, with or without 5' triphosphorylation, RNA-binding is required for antiviral activity. Can promote apoptosis.
