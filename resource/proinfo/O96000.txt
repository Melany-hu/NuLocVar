UniprotID	O96000
Accession	O96000;Q96II6
EntryName	NDUBA_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 10 (Complex I-PDSW) (CI-PDSW) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase PDSW subunit)
GeneName	NDUFB10
Length	172
Function	Accessory subunit that is involved in the functional assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. Complex I has an NADH dehydrogenase activity with ubiquinone as an immediate electron acceptor and mediates the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain.
