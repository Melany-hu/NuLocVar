UniprotID	P38484
Accession	P38484;Q9BTL5
EntryName	INGR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon gamma receptor 2 (IFN-gamma receptor 2) (IFN-gamma-R2) (Interferon gamma receptor accessory factor 1) (AF-1) (Interferon gamma receptor beta-chain) (IFN-gamma-R-beta) (Interferon gamma transducer 1)
GeneName	IFNGR2 IFNGT1
Length	337
Function	Associates with IFNGR1 to form a receptor for the cytokine interferon gamma (IFNG) (PubMed:7615558, PubMed:7673114, PubMed:8124716). Ligand binding stimulates activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (PubMed:15356148, PubMed:7673114, PubMed:8124716). Required for signal transduction in contrast to other receptor subunit responsible for ligand binding (PubMed:7673114).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Cytoplasm
