UniprotID	O60248
Accession	O60248;B4DWU7;D3DTQ0;P35717;Q9Y6W7
EntryName	SOX15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor SOX-15 (Protein SOX-12) (Protein SOX-20) (SRY-box transcription factor 15)
GeneName	SOX15 SOX12 SOX20 SOX26 SOX27
Length	233
Function	Transcription factor that binds to DNA at the 5'-AACAATG-3' consensus sequence (By similarity). Acts as a transcriptional activator and repressor (By similarity). Binds synergistically with POU5F1 (OCT3/4) to gene promoters (By similarity). Binds to the FOXK1 promoter and recruits FHL3, resulting in transcriptional activation of FOXK1 which leads to myoblast proliferation (By similarity). Acts as an inhibitor of myoblast differentiation via transcriptional repression which leads to down-regulation of the muscle-specific genes MYOD and MYOG (By similarity). Involved in trophoblast giant cell differentiation via enhancement of HAND1 transcriptional activity (By similarity). Regulates transcription of HRC via binding to it proximal enhancer region (By similarity). Involved in skeletal muscle regeneration (By similarity). Also plays a role in the development of myogenic precursor cells (By similarity).
