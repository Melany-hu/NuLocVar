UniprotID	P51911
Accession	P51911;B2R868;B4DUX6;O00638;Q15416;Q8IY93;Q99438
EntryName	CNN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calponin-1 (Basic calponin) (Calponin H1, smooth muscle)
GeneName	CNN1
Length	297
Function	Thin filament-associated protein that is implicated in the regulation and modulation of smooth muscle contraction. It is capable of binding to actin, calmodulin and tropomyosin. The interaction of calponin with actin inhibits the actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity (By similarity).
