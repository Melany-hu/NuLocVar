UniprotID	Q9H1A7
Accession	Q9H1A7;A6NKA1
EntryName	RPB1C_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB11-b2 (RNA polymerase II subunit B11-b2) (RPB11b2) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit J3)
GeneName	POLR2J3
Length	115
Function	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB11 is part of the core element with the central large cleft (By similarity).
