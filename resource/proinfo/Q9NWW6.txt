UniprotID	Q9NWW6
Accession	Q9NWW6;Q5W124;Q8N430
EntryName	NRK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 (NRK 1) (NmR-K 1) (EC 2.7.1.22) (Nicotinic acid riboside kinase 1) (EC 2.7.1.173) (Ribosylnicotinamide kinase 1) (RNK 1) (Ribosylnicotinic acid kinase 1)
GeneName	NMRK1 C9orf95 NRK1
Length	199
Function	Catalyzes the phosphorylation of nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinic acid riboside (NaR) to form nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN). The enzyme also phosphorylates the antitumor drugs tiazofurin and 3-deazaguanosine.
