EntryName	CALM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calmodulin-2
GeneName	CALM2 CAM2 CAMB
Length	149
Function	Calmodulin acts as part of a calcium signal transduction pathway by mediating the control of a large number of enzymes, ion channels, aquaporins and other proteins through calcium-binding (PubMed:16760425, PubMed:26969752, PubMed:27165696). Calcium-binding is required for the activation of calmodulin (PubMed:16760425, PubMed:26969752, PubMed:27165696, PubMed:35568036). Among the enzymes to be stimulated by the calmodulin-calcium complex are a number of protein kinases, such as myosin light-chain kinases and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMK2), and phosphatases (PubMed:16760425, PubMed:26969752, PubMed:27165696, PubMed:35568036). Together with CCP110 and centrin, is involved in a genetic pathway that regulates the centrosome cycle and progression through cytokinesis (PubMed:16760425). Mediates calcium-dependent inactivation of CACNA1C (PubMed:26969752). Positively regulates calcium-activated potassium channel activity of KCNN2 (PubMed:27165696).
