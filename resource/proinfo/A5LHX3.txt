UniprotID	A5LHX3
Accession	A5LHX3
EntryName	PSB11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteasome subunit beta type-11 (EC 3.4.25.1) (Proteasome subunit beta-5t)
GeneName	PSMB11
Length	300
Function	The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex which is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or slightly basic pH. The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity. Incorporated instead of PSMB5 or PSMB8, this unit reduces the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome (By similarity). Plays a pivotal role in development of CD8-positive T cells (By similarity).
