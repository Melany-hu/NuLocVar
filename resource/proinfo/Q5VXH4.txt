UniprotID	Q5VXH4
Accession	Q5VXH4;A0AUJ9
EntryName	PRAM6_HUMAN
ProteinName	PRAME family member 6
GeneName	PRAMEF6
Length	476
Function	Substrate-recognition component of a Cul2-RING (CRL2) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, which mediates ubiquitination of target proteins, leading to their degradation (PubMed:26138980). The CRL2(PRAMEF6) complex mediates ubiquitination and degradation of truncated MSRB1/SEPX1 selenoproteins produced by failed UGA/Sec decoding (PubMed:26138980).
