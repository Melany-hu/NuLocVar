UniprotID	O43602
Accession	O43602;A6NFY6;A9Z1V8;D3DUY8;D3DUY9;D3DUZ0;O43911;Q5JYZ5
EntryName	DCX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuronal migration protein doublecortin (Doublin) (Lissencephalin-X) (Lis-X)
GeneName	DCX DBCN LISX
Length	365
Function	Microtubule-associated protein required for initial steps of neuronal dispersion and cortex lamination during cerebral cortex development. May act by competing with the putative neuronal protein kinase DCLK1 in binding to a target protein. May in that way participate in a signaling pathway that is crucial for neuronal interaction before and during migration, possibly as part of a calcium ion-dependent signal transduction pathway. May be part with PAFAH1B1/LIS-1 of overlapping, but distinct, signaling pathways that promote neuronal migration.
