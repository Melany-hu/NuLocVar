UniprotID	Q86X76
Accession	Q86X76;B1AQP3;D3DVF4;O76091
EntryName	NIT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deaminated glutathione amidase (dGSH amidase) (EC 3.5.1.128) (Nitrilase homolog 1)
GeneName	NIT1
Length	327
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolysis of the amide bond in N-(4-oxoglutarate)-L-cysteinylglycine (deaminated glutathione), a metabolite repair reaction to dispose of the harmful deaminated glutathione. Plays a role in cell growth and apoptosis: loss of expression promotes cell growth, resistance to DNA damage stress and increased incidence to NMBA-induced tumors. Has tumor suppressor properties that enhances the apoptotic responsiveness in cancer cells; this effect is additive to the tumor suppressor activity of FHIT. It is also a negative regulator of primary T-cells.
