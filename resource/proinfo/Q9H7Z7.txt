UniprotID	Q9H7Z7
Accession	Q9H7Z7;Q53EW9;Q5SYV6;Q96GI0;Q96GL2
EntryName	PGES2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostaglandin E synthase 2 (EC 5.3.99.3) (Membrane-associated prostaglandin E synthase-2) (mPGE synthase-2) (Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 2) (mPGES-2) (Prostaglandin-H(2) E-isomerase) [Cleaved into: Prostaglandin E synthase 2 truncated form]
GeneName	PTGES2 C9orf15 PGES2
Length	377
Function	Isomerase that catalyzes the conversion of PGH2 into the more stable prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (in vitro) (PubMed:12804604, PubMed:17585783, PubMed:18198127). The biological function and the GSH-dependent property of PTGES2 is still under debate (PubMed:17585783, PubMed:18198127). In vivo, PTGES2 could form a complex with GSH and heme and would not participate in PGE2 synthesis but would catalyze the degradation of prostaglandin E2 H2 (PGH2) to 12(S)-hydroxy-5(Z),8(E),10(E)-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (By similarity) (PubMed:17585783).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region
