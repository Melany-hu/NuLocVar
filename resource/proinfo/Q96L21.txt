UniprotID	Q96L21
Accession	Q96L21;Q8IUD1
EntryName	RL10L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosomal protein uL16-like (60S ribosomal protein L10-like) (Large ribosomal subunit protein uL16-like)
GeneName	RPL10L
Length	214
Function	Testis-specific component of the ribosome, which is required for the transition from prophase to metaphase in male meiosis I (By similarity). Compensates for the inactivated X-linked RPL10 paralog during spermatogenesis (PubMed:12490704). The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:23636399, PubMed:25901680, PubMed:32669547). The male germ cell-specific ribosome displays a ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel of distinct size and charge states compared with the classical ribosome (By similarity). It is responsible for regulating the biosynthesis and folding of a subset of male germ-cell-specific proteins that are essential for the formation of sperm (By similarity).
