UniprotID	P43005
Accession	P43005;O75587;Q5VZ24;Q8N199;Q9UEW2
EntryName	EAA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (Excitatory amino-acid carrier 1) (Neuronal and epithelial glutamate transporter) (Sodium-dependent glutamate/aspartate transporter 3) (Solute carrier family 1 member 1)
GeneName	SLC1A1 EAAC1 EAAT3 HEAAC1
Length	524
Function	Sodium-dependent, high-affinity amino acid transporter that mediates the uptake of L-glutamate and also L-aspartate and D-aspartate (PubMed:21123949, PubMed:26690923, PubMed:33658209, PubMed:7521911, PubMed:7914198, PubMed:8857541). Can also transport L-cysteine (PubMed:21123949). Functions as a symporter that transports one amino acid molecule together with two or three Na(+) ions and one proton, in parallel with the counter-transport of one K(+) ion (PubMed:26690923, PubMed:33658209, PubMed:7521911, PubMed:8857541). Mediates Cl(-) flux that is not coupled to amino acid transport; this avoids the accumulation of negative charges due to aspartate and Na(+) symport (PubMed:26690923, PubMed:8857541). Plays an important role in L-glutamate and L-aspartate reabsorption in renal tubuli (PubMed:21123949). Plays a redundant role in the rapid removal of released glutamate from the synaptic cleft, which is essential for terminating the postsynaptic action of glutamate (By similarity). Contributes to glutathione biosynthesis and protection against oxidative stress via its role in L-glutamate and L-cysteine transport (By similarity). Negatively regulated by ARL6IP5 (By similarity).
