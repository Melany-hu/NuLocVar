UniprotID	Q9HBM1
Accession	Q9HBM1;A8K4X8;D3DPC0
EntryName	SPC25_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kinetochore protein Spc25 (hSpc25)
GeneName	SPC25 SPBC25 AD024
Length	224
Function	Acts as a component of the essential kinetochore-associated NDC80 complex, which is required for chromosome segregation and spindle checkpoint activity (PubMed:14699129, PubMed:14738735). Required for kinetochore integrity and the organization of stable microtubule binding sites in the outer plate of the kinetochore (PubMed:14699129, PubMed:14738735). The NDC80 complex synergistically enhances the affinity of the SKA1 complex for microtubules and may allow the NDC80 complex to track depolymerizing microtubules (PubMed:23085020).
