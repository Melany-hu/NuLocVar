EntryName	MARH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MARCHF1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Membrane-associated RING finger protein 1) (Membrane-associated RING-CH protein I) (MARCH-I) (RING finger protein 171) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase MARCHF1)
GeneName	MARCHF1 MARCH1 RNF171
Length	289
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates ubiquitination of TFRC, CD86, FAS and MHC class II proteins, such as HLA-DR alpha and beta, and promotes their subsequent endocytosis and sorting to lysosomes via multivesicular bodies (PubMed:18389477, PubMed:18305173, PubMed:21220452, PubMed:35045264). By constitutively ubiquitinating MHC class II proteins in immature dendritic cells, down-regulates their cell surface localization thus sequestering them in the intracellular endosomal system. Also regulates insulin sensitivity by controlling surface expression of the insulin receptor subunit beta/INSR by direct ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:27577745).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane; Lysosome membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Late endosome membrane; Early endosome membrane; Cell membrane
