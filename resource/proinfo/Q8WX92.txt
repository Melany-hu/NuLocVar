EntryName	NELFB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Negative elongation factor B (NELF-B) (Cofactor of BRCA1)
GeneName	NELFB COBRA1 KIAA1182
Length	580
Function	Essential component of the NELF complex, a complex that negatively regulates the elongation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (PubMed:12612062). The NELF complex, which acts via an association with the DSIF complex and causes transcriptional pausing, is counteracted by the P-TEFb kinase complex (PubMed:10199401). May be able to induce chromatin unfolding (PubMed:11739404). Essential for early embryogenesis; plays an important role in maintaining the undifferentiated state of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by preventing unscheduled expression of developmental genes (By similarity). Plays a key role in establishing the responsiveness of stem cells to developmental cues; facilitates plasticity and cell fate commitment in ESCs by establishing the appropriate expression level of signaling molecules (By similarity). Supports the transcription of genes involved in energy metabolism in cardiomyocytes; facilitates the association of transcription initiation factors with the promoters of the metabolism-related genes (By similarity).
