UniprotID	O43561
Accession	O43561;B7WPI0;C7C5T6;G5E9K3;O43919
EntryName	LAT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Linker for activation of T-cells family member 1 (36 kDa phosphotyrosine adapter protein) (pp36) (p36-38)
GeneName	LAT
Length	262
Function	Required for TCR (T-cell antigen receptor)- and pre-TCR-mediated signaling, both in mature T-cells and during their development (PubMed:23514740, PubMed:25907557). Involved in FCGR3 (low affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor III)-mediated signaling in natural killer cells and FCER1 (high affinity immunoglobulin epsilon receptor)-mediated signaling in mast cells. Couples activation of these receptors and their associated kinases with distal intracellular events such as mobilization of intracellular calcium stores, PKC activation, MAPK activation or cytoskeletal reorganization through the recruitment of PLCG1, GRB2, GRAP2, and other signaling molecules.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
