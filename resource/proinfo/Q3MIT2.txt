EntryName	PUS10_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA pseudouridine synthase Pus10 (Hup10) (EC 5.4.99.25) (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 139) (tRNA pseudouridine 55 synthase) (Psi55 synthase) (tRNA pseudouridylate synthase) (tRNA-uridine isomerase)
GeneName	PUS10 CCDC139 DOBI
Length	529
Function	Protein with different functions depending on its subcellular location: involved in miRNA processing in the nucleus and acts as a tRNA pseudouridylate synthase in the cytoplasm (PubMed:31819270, PubMed:33023933). In the cytoplasm, acts as a pseudouridylate synthase by catalyzing synthesis of pseudouridine(54) and pseudouridine(55) from uracil-54 and uracil-55, respectively, in the psi GC loop of a subset of tRNAs (PubMed:30530625, PubMed:31819270, PubMed:33023933). tRNA pseudouridylate synthase activity is enhanced by the presence of 1-methyladenosine at position 53-61 of tRNAs (PubMed:30530625). Does not show tRNA pseudouridylate synthase activity in the nucleus (PubMed:33023933). In the nucleus, promotes primary microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) processing independently of its RNA pseudouridylate synthase activity (PubMed:31819270). Binds pri-miRNAs (PubMed:31819270). Modulator of TRAIL/TNFSF10-induced cell death via activation of procaspase-8 and BID cleavage (PubMed:14527409, PubMed:19712588). Required for the progression of the apoptotic signal through intrinsic mitochondrial cell death (PubMed:19712588).
