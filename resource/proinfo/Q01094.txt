EntryName	E2F1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor E2F1 (E2F-1) (PBR3) (Retinoblastoma-associated protein 1) (RBAP-1) (Retinoblastoma-binding protein 3) (RBBP-3) (pRB-binding protein E2F-1)
GeneName	E2F1 RBBP3
Length	437
Function	Transcription activator that binds DNA cooperatively with DP proteins through the E2 recognition site, 5'-TTTCCGC-3' found in the promoter region of a number of genes whose products are involved in cell cycle regulation or in DNA replication (PubMed:10675335, PubMed:12717439, PubMed:17050006, PubMed:17704056, PubMed:18625225, PubMed:28992046). The DRTF1/E2F complex functions in the control of cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase (PubMed:10675335, PubMed:12717439, PubMed:17704056). E2F1 binds preferentially RB1 in a cell-cycle dependent manner (PubMed:10675335, PubMed:12717439, PubMed:17704056). It can mediate both cell proliferation and TP53/p53-dependent apoptosis (PubMed:8170954). Blocks adipocyte differentiation by binding to specific promoters repressing CEBPA binding to its target gene promoters (PubMed:20176812). Directly activates transcription of PEG10 (PubMed:17050006, PubMed:18625225, PubMed:28992046). Positively regulates transcription of RRP1B (PubMed:20040599).
