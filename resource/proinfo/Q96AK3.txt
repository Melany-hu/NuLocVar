EntryName	ABC3D_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA dC->dU-editing enzyme APOBEC-3D (A3D) (A3DE) (EC 3.5.4.38)
GeneName	APOBEC3D APOBEC3DE
Length	386
Function	DNA deaminase (cytidine deaminase) which acts as an inhibitor of retrovirus replication and retrotransposon mobility via deaminase-dependent and -independent mechanisms (PubMed:16920826, PubMed:20062055, PubMed:21835787). Exhibits antiviral activity against HIV-1. After the penetration of retroviral nucleocapsids into target cells of infection and the initiation of reverse transcription, it can induce the conversion of cytosine to uracil in the minus-sense single-strand viral DNA, leading to G-to-A hypermutations in the subsequent plus-strand viral DNA (PubMed:16920826). The resultant detrimental levels of mutations in the proviral genome, along with a deamination-independent mechanism that works prior to the proviral integration, together exert efficient antiretroviral effects in infected target cells. Selectively targets single-stranded DNA and does not deaminate double-stranded DNA or single- or double-stranded RNA. Also inhibits the mobility of LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons (PubMed:27428332).
