EntryName	CCNY_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-Y (Cyc-Y) (Cyclin box protein 1) (Cyclin fold protein 1) (cyclin-X)
GeneName	CCNY C10orf9 CBCP1 CFP1
Length	341
Function	Positive regulatory subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK14/PFTK1 and CDK16. Acts as a cell-cycle regulator of Wnt signaling pathway during G2/M phase by recruiting CDK14/PFTK1 to the plasma membrane and promoting phosphorylation of LRP6, leading to the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Recruits CDK16 to the plasma membrane. Isoform 3 might play a role in the activation of MYC-mediated transcription.
