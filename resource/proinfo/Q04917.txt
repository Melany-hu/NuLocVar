UniprotID	Q04917
Accession	Q04917
EntryName	1433F_HUMAN
ProteinName	14-3-3 protein eta (Protein AS1)
GeneName	YWHAH YWHA1
Length	246
Function	Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathways. Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner. Negatively regulates the kinase activity of PDPK1.
