UniprotID	Q9UKT5
Accession	Q9UKT5;Q68CU8;Q86VT8;Q9UK98
EntryName	FBX4_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-box only protein 4
GeneName	FBXO4 FBX4
Length	387
Function	Substrate recognition component of a SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex that mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:10531035, PubMed:18598945, PubMed:20181953, PubMed:29142209). Promotes ubiquitination of CCND1 and its subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:18598945). Recognizes TERF1 and promotes its ubiquitination together with UBE2D1 (PubMed:16275645, PubMed:20159592). Promotes ubiquitination of FXR1 following phosphorylation of FXR1 by GSK3B, leading to FXR1 degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:29142209).
