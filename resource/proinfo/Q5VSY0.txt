UniprotID	Q5VSY0
Accession	Q5VSY0;Q96LI0;Q9BYI1;Q9BYI2;Q9H225
EntryName	GKAP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	G kinase-anchoring protein 1 (cGMP-dependent protein kinase-anchoring protein of 42 kDa)
GeneName	GKAP1 GKAP42 FKSG21
Length	366
Function	Regulates insulin-dependent IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation in adipocytes by modulating the availability of IRS1 to IR tyrosine kinase. Its association with IRS1 is required for insulin-induced translocation of SLC2A4 to the cell membrane. Involved in TNF-induced impairment of insulin-dependent IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus
