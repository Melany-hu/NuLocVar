UniprotID	Q9NP61
Accession	Q9NP61;E9PB03;Q9BSC6;Q9H9J0;Q9NT10;Q9NUP5;Q9Y4V3;Q9Y4V4
EntryName	ARFG3_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 3 (ARF GAP 3)
GeneName	ARFGAP3 ARFGAP1
Length	516
Function	GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for ADP ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1). Hydrolysis of ARF1-bound GTP may lead to dissociation of coatomer from Golgi-derived membranes to allow fusion with target membranes.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Golgi apparatus membrane
