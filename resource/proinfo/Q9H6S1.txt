UniprotID	Q9H6S1
Accession	Q9H6S1;A8K3M2;C9JB40;H7BXU6;Q86W99;Q9BQF1
EntryName	AZI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-azacytidine-induced protein 2 (NF-kappa-B-activating kinase-associated protein 1) (Nak-associated protein 1) (Nap1) (TILP)
GeneName	AZI2 NAP1 TBKBP2
Length	392
Function	Adapter protein which binds TBK1 and IKBKE playing a role in antiviral innate immunity (PubMed:14560022, PubMed:21931631). Activates serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1 and facilitates its oligomerization (PubMed:14560022, PubMed:21931631). Enhances the phosphorylation of NF-kappa-B p65 subunit RELA by TBK1 (PubMed:14560022, PubMed:21931631). Promotes TBK1-induced as well as TNF-alpha or PMA-induced activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:14560022, PubMed:21931631). Participates in IFNB promoter activation via TICAM1 (PubMed:15611223).
