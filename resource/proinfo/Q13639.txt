EntryName	5HT4R_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 (5-HT-4) (5-HT4) (Serotonin receptor 4)
GeneName	HTR4
Length	388
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), a biogenic hormone that functions as a neurotransmitter, a hormone and a mitogen (PubMed:10821780, PubMed:16102731, PubMed:35714614, PubMed:9603189). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors (PubMed:16102731, PubMed:35714614). HTR4 is coupled to G(s) G alpha proteins and mediates activation of adenylate cyclase activity (PubMed:16102731, PubMed:35714614).
