UniprotID	Q12918
Accession	Q12918;Q24K24
EntryName	KLRB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily B member 1 (C-type lectin domain family 5 member B) (HNKR-P1a) (NKR-P1A) (Natural killer cell surface protein P1A) (CD antigen CD161)
GeneName	KLRB1 CLEC5B NKRP1A
Length	225
Function	Plays an inhibitory role on natural killer (NK) cells cytotoxicity. Activation results in specific acid sphingomyelinase/SMPD1 stimulation with subsequent marked elevation of intracellular ceramide. Activation also leads to AKT1/PKB and RPS6KA1/RSK1 kinases stimulation as well as markedly enhanced T-cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3. Acts as a lectin that binds to the terminal carbohydrate Gal-alpha(1,3)Gal epitope as well as to the N-acetyllactosamine epitope. Also binds to CLEC2D/LLT1 as a ligand and inhibits NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity as well as interferon-gamma secretion in target cells.
