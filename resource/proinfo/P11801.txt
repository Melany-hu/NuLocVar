UniprotID	P11801
Accession	P11801;Q9NY19
EntryName	KPSH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase H1 (EC 2.7.11.1) (Protein serine kinase H1) (PSK-H1)
GeneName	PSKH1
Length	424
Function	Serine/threonine protein kinase that may be involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA processing. It may phosphorylate components of nuclear splice factor compartments (SFC), such as non-snRNP splicing factors containing a serine/arginine-rich domain (SR proteins). Reversible phosphorylation of SR proteins may cause their release into the nucleoplasm and change their local concentration, thereby influencing alternative splicing.
