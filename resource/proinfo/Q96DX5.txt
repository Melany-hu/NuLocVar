UniprotID	Q96DX5
Accession	Q96DX5;A8K8A5;Q9BVF5;Q9NWS5;Q9Y4T3
EntryName	ASB9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 9 (ASB-9)
GeneName	ASB9
Length	294
Function	Substrate-recognition component of a cullin-5-RING E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (ECS complex, also named CRL5 complex), which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:25654263, PubMed:33268465). The ECS(ASB9) complex catalyzes ubiquitination of creatine kinases CKB and CKMT1A (PubMed:20302626, PubMed:22418839, PubMed:25654263, PubMed:33268465).
