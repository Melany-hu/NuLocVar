UniprotID	Q8TF74
Accession	Q8TF74;A8K0L3;Q658J8;Q71RE1;Q8TE44
EntryName	WIPF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	WAS/WASL-interacting protein family member 2 (WASP-interacting protein-related protein) (WIP- and CR16-homologous protein) (WIP-related protein)
GeneName	WIPF2 WICH WIRE PP10631
Length	440
Function	Plays an active role in the formation of cell surface protrusions downstream of activated PDGFB receptors. Plays an important role in actin-microspike formation through cooperation with WASL. May cooperate with WASP and WASL to induce mobilization and reorganization of the actin filament system.
