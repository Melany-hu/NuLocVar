EntryName	P2RX5_HUMAN
ProteinName	P2X purinoceptor 5 (P2X5) (ATP receptor) (Purinergic receptor)
GeneName	P2RX5 P2X5 P2X5FL
Length	444
Function	ATP-gated nonselective transmembrane cation channel permeable to potassium, sodium and calcium (PubMed:12761352). Unlike, other P2RX receptors, the P2X5 receptor is also permeable to chloride (PubMed:12761352). May play a supporting role in the inflammatory response (By similarity).
