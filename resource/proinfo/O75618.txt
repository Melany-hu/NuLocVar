UniprotID	O75618
Accession	O75618;D3DVF5;O60737
EntryName	DEDD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Death effector domain-containing protein (DEDPro1) (Death effector domain-containing testicular molecule) (FLDED-1)
GeneName	DEDD DEDPRO1 DEFT KE05
Length	318
Function	A scaffold protein that directs CASP3 to certain substrates and facilitates their ordered degradation during apoptosis. May also play a role in mediating CASP3 cleavage of KRT18. Regulates degradation of intermediate filaments during apoptosis. May play a role in the general transcription machinery in the nucleus and might be an important regulator of the activity of GTF3C3. Inhibits DNA transcription in vitro (By similarity).
