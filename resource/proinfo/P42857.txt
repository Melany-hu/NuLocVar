UniprotID	P42857
Accession	P42857;B4DXC5;Q49AQ1
EntryName	NSG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuronal vesicle trafficking-associated protein 1 (Neuron-enriched endosomal protein of 21 kDa) (Neuron-specific protein family member 1)
GeneName	NSG1 D4S234 NEEP21
Length	185
Function	Plays a role in the recycling mechanism in neurons of multiple receptors, including AMPAR, APP and L1CAM and acts at the level of early endosomes to promote sorting of receptors toward a recycling pathway. Regulates sorting and recycling of GRIA2 through interaction with GRIP1 and then contributes to the regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity by affecting the recycling and targeting of AMPA receptors to the synapse (By similarity). Is required for faithful sorting of L1CAM to axons by facilitating trafficking from somatodendritic early endosome or the recycling endosome (By similarity). In an other hand, induces apoptosis via the activation of CASP3 in response to DNA damage (PubMed:20599942, PubMed:20878061).
