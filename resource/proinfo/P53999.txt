UniprotID	P53999
Accession	P53999;Q96L29
EntryName	TCP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Activated RNA polymerase II transcriptional coactivator p15 (Positive cofactor 4) (PC4) (SUB1 homolog) (p14)
GeneName	SUB1 PC4 RPO2TC1
Length	127
Function	General coactivator that functions cooperatively with TAFs and mediates functional interactions between upstream activators and the general transcriptional machinery. May be involved in stabilizing the multiprotein transcription complex. Binds single-stranded DNA. Also binds, in vitro, non-specifically to double-stranded DNA (ds DNA).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
