UniprotID	P61803
Accession	P61803;D3DS25;O08552;O70364;P46966;P46968;Q6FGA3;Q96GB7
EntryName	DAD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase subunit DAD1 (Oligosaccharyl transferase subunit DAD1) (Defender against cell death 1) (DAD-1)
GeneName	DAD1
Length	113
Function	Subunit of the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) complex that catalyzes the initial transfer of a defined glycan (Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) in eukaryotes) from the lipid carrier dolichol-pyrophosphate to an asparagine residue within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif in nascent polypeptide chains, the first step in protein N-glycosylation (PubMed:22467853, PubMed:31831667). N-glycosylation occurs cotranslationally and the complex associates with the Sec61 complex at the channel-forming translocon complex that mediates protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). All subunits are required for a maximal enzyme activity (By similarity). Required for the assembly of both SST3A- and SS3B-containing OST complexes. Loss of the DAD1 protein triggers apoptosis (PubMed:22467853).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
