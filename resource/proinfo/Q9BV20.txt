UniprotID	Q9BV20
Accession	Q9BV20;Q8NDC9
EntryName	MTNA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methylthioribose-1-phosphate isomerase (M1Pi) (MTR-1-P isomerase) (EC 5.3.1.23) (Mediator of RhoA-dependent invasion) (S-methyl-5-thioribose-1-phosphate isomerase) (Translation initiation factor eIF-2B subunit alpha/beta/delta-like protein)
GeneName	MRI1 MRDI UNQ6390/PRO21135
Length	369
Function	Catalyzes the interconversion of methylthioribose-1-phosphate (MTR-1-P) into methylthioribulose-1-phosphate (MTRu-1-P). Independently from catalytic activity, promotes cell invasion in response to constitutive RhoA activation by promoting FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and stress fiber turnover.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cell projection
