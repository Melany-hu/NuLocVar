UniprotID	Q03403
Accession	Q03403;Q15854
EntryName	TFF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trefoil factor 2 (Spasmolysin) (Spasmolytic polypeptide) (SP)
GeneName	TFF2 SML1
Length	129
Function	Inhibits gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion. Could function as a structural component of gastric mucus, possibly by stabilizing glycoproteins in the mucus gel through interactions with carbohydrate side chains (By similarity).
