UniprotID	Q8N3J6
Accession	Q8N3J6;G3XHN7;G3XHN8;Q3KQY9;Q658Q7;Q8IZP8
EntryName	CADM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cell adhesion molecule 2 (Immunoglobulin superfamily member 4D) (IgSF4D) (Nectin-like protein 3) (NECL-3) (Synaptic cell adhesion molecule 2) (SynCAM 2)
GeneName	CADM2 IGSF4D NECL3
Length	435
Function	Adhesion molecule that engages in homo- and heterophilic interactions with the other nectin-like family members, leading to cell aggregation. Important for synapse organization, providing regulated trans-synaptic adhesion. Preferentially binds to oligodendrocytes.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Synapse; Cell projection; Axon
