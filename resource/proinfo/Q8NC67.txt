UniprotID	Q8NC67
Accession	Q8NC67;J3KNF1;Q7Z381;Q8ND51;Q96SP4;Q9NVY8
EntryName	NETO2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuropilin and tolloid-like protein 2 (Brain-specific transmembrane protein containing 2 CUB and 1 LDL-receptor class A domains protein 2)
GeneName	NETO2 BTCL2 UNQ1926/PRO4401
Length	525
Function	Accessory subunit of neuronal kainate-sensitive glutamate receptors, GRIK2 and GRIK3. Increases kainate-receptor channel activity, slowing the decay kinetics of the receptors, without affecting their expression at the cell surface, and increasing the open probability of the receptor channels. Modulates the agonist sensitivity of kainate receptors. Slows the decay of kainate receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), thus directly influencing synaptic transmission (By similarity).
