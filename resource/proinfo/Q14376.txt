EntryName	GALE_HUMAN
ProteinName	UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2) (Galactowaldenase) (UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine 4-epimerase) (UDP-GalNAc 4-epimerase) (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 4-epimerase) (UDP-GlcNAc 4-epimerase) (EC 5.1.3.7) (UDP-galactose 4-epimerase)
GeneName	GALE
Length	348
Function	Catalyzes two distinct but analogous reactions: the reversible epimerization of UDP-glucose to UDP-galactose and the reversible epimerization of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine. The reaction with UDP-Gal plays a critical role in the Leloir pathway of galactose catabolism in which galactose is converted to the glycolytic intermediate glucose 6-phosphate. It contributes to the catabolism of dietary galactose and enables the endogenous biosynthesis of both UDP-Gal and UDP-GalNAc when exogenous sources are limited. Both UDP-sugar interconversions are important in the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids.
