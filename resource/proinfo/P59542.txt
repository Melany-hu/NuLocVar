UniprotID	P59542
Accession	P59542;Q3MIJ4;Q645X8
EntryName	T2R19_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 19 (Taste receptor type 2 member 23) (Taste receptor type 2 member 48) (T2R48)
GeneName	TAS2R19 TAS2R23 TAS2R48
Length	299
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5 (By similarity).
