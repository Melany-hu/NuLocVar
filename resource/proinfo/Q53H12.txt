EntryName	AGK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acylglycerol kinase, mitochondrial (hAGK) (EC 2.7.1.107) (EC 2.7.1.138) (EC 2.7.1.94) (Multiple substrate lipid kinase) (HsMuLK) (MuLK) (Multi-substrate lipid kinase)
GeneName	AGK MULK
Length	422
Function	Lipid kinase that can phosphorylate both monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and phosphatidic acid (PA), respectively (PubMed:15939762). Does not phosphorylate sphingosine (PubMed:15939762). Phosphorylates ceramide (By similarity). Phosphorylates 1,2-dioleoylglycerol more rapidly than 2,3-dioleoylglycerol (By similarity). Independently of its lipid kinase activity, acts as a component of the TIM22 complex (PubMed:28712724, PubMed:28712726). The TIM22 complex mediates the import and insertion of multi-pass transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane by forming a twin-pore translocase that uses the membrane potential as the external driving force (PubMed:28712724, PubMed:28712726). In the TIM22 complex, required for the import of a subset of metabolite carriers into mitochondria, such as ANT1/SLC25A4 and SLC25A24, while it is not required for the import of TIMM23 (PubMed:28712724). Overexpression increases the formation and secretion of LPA, resulting in transactivation of EGFR and activation of the downstream MAPK signaling pathway, leading to increased cell growth (PubMed:15939762).
