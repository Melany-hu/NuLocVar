UniprotID	Q5BKX8
Accession	Q5BKX8;B1PRL3;B4DT88
EntryName	CAVN4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caveolae-associated protein 4 (Muscle-related coiled-coil protein) (Muscle-restricted coiled-coil protein)
GeneName	CAVIN4 MURC
Length	364
Function	Modulates the morphology of formed caveolae in cardiomyocytes, but is not required for caveolar formation. Facilitates the recruitment of MAPK1/3 to caveolae within cardiomyocytes and regulates alpha-1 adrenergic receptor-induced hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes through MAPK1/3 activation. Contributes to proper membrane localization and stabilization of caveolin-3 (CAV3) in cardiomyocytes (By similarity). Induces RHOA activation and activates NPPA transcription and myofibrillar organization through the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway (PubMed:18332105).
