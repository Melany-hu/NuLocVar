UniprotID	Q8NFA2
Accession	Q8NFA2;Q86YM1;Q8NFA3;Q96B73
EntryName	NOXO1_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADPH oxidase organizer 1 (NADPH oxidase regulatory protein) (Nox organizer 1) (Nox-organizing protein 1) (SH3 and PX domain-containing protein 5)
GeneName	NOXO1 P41NOX SH3PXD5
Length	376
Function	Constitutively potentiates the superoxide-generating activity of NOX1 and NOX3 and is required for the biogenesis of otoconia/otolith, which are crystalline structures of the inner ear involved in the perception of gravity. Isoform 3 is more potent than isoform 1 in activating NOX3. Together with NOXA1, may also substitute to NCF1/p47phox and NCF2/p67phox in supporting the phagocyte NOX2/gp91phox superoxide-generating activity.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
