Function	Cytosolic aldo-keto reductase that catalyzes the NADH and NADPH-dependent reduction of ketosteroids to hydroxysteroids. Liver specific enzyme that acts as an NAD(P)(H)-dependent 3-, 17- and 20-ketosteroid reductase on the steroid nucleus and side chain (PubMed:10634139, PubMed:10998348, PubMed:11158055, PubMed:14672942, PubMed:1530633, PubMed:19218247, PubMed:7650035). Displays the ability to catalyze both oxidation and reduction in vitro, but most probably acts as a reductase in vivo since the oxidase activity measured in vitro is inhibited by physiological concentration of NADPH (PubMed:14672942). Acts preferentially as a 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) with a subsidiary 3-beta-HSD activity (PubMed:14672942). Catalyzes efficiently the transformation of the potent androgen 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5alpha-DHT or 17beta-hydroxy-5alpha-androstan-3-one) into the less active form, 5-alpha-androstan-3-alpha,17-beta-diol (3-alpha-diol) (PubMed:10998348, PubMed:11158055, PubMed:14672942). Catalyzes the reduction of estrone into 17beta-estradiol but with low efficiency (PubMed:14672942). Metabolizes a broad spectrum of natural and synthetic therapeutic steroid and plays an important role in metabolism of androgens, estrogens, progestereone and conjugated steroids (PubMed:10998348, PubMed:14672942, PubMed:19218247). Catalyzes the biotransformation of the pesticide chlordecone (kepone) to its corresponding alcohol leading to increased biliary excretion of the pesticide and concomitant reduction of its neurotoxicity since bile is the major excretory route (PubMed:2427522).
