UniprotID	P78543
Accession	P78543;A0A024R986;Q3KR25;Q5VUT0
EntryName	BTG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein BTG2 (BTG family member 2) (NGF-inducible anti-proliferative protein PC3)
GeneName	BTG2 PC3
Length	158
Function	Anti-proliferative protein; the function is mediated by association with deadenylase subunits of the CCR4-NOT complex. Activates mRNA deadenylation in a CNOT6 and CNOT7-dependent manner. In vitro can inhibit deadenylase activity of CNOT7 and CNOT8. Involved in cell cycle regulation. Could be involved in the growth arrest and differentiation of the neuronal precursors (By similarity). Modulates transcription regulation mediated by ESR1. Involved in mitochondrial depolarization and neurite outgrowth.
