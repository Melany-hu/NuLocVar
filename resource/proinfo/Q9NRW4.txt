UniprotID	Q9NRW4
Accession	Q9NRW4;B4DK56;Q59GW2;Q5VWR2;Q96AR1
EntryName	DUS22_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity protein phosphatase 22 (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.48) (JNK pathway associated phosphatase) (JKAP) (JNK-stimulatory phosphatase-1) (JSP-1) (Low molecular weight dual specificity phosphatase 2) (LMW-DSP2) (Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase x) (MAP kinase phosphatase x) (MKP-x)
GeneName	DUSP22 JSP1 LMWDSP2 MKPX
Length	184
Function	Dual specificity phosphatase; can dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine or phosphothreonine residues (PubMed:24714587, PubMed:38225265). Activates the JNK signaling pathway (PubMed:11717427). Inhibits T-cell receptor signaling and T-cell mediated immune responses, acting, at least in part, by inducing degradation of E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR2 (PubMed:24714587, PubMed:38225265). Dephosphorylates and thereby induces 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination of UBR2, leading to proteasomal degradation of UBR2 (PubMed:38225265). Dephosphorylates and thereby inactivates tyrosine kinase LCK (PubMed:24714587). Inhibits UBR2-mediated 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of LCK (PubMed:38225265). May play a role in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and B-cell function (By similarity).
