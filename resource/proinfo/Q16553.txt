UniprotID	Q16553
Accession	Q16553;B2R4X5;D3DWJ2;Q0VDE5
EntryName	LY6E_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lymphocyte antigen 6E (Ly-6E) (Retinoic acid-induced gene E protein) (RIG-E) (Stem cell antigen 2) (SCA-2) (Thymic shared antigen 1) (TSA-1)
GeneName	LY6E 9804 RIGE SCA2 TSA1
Length	131
Function	GPI-anchored cell surface protein that regulates T-lymphocytes proliferation, differentiation, and activation. Regulates the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling by interacting with component CD3Z/CD247 at the plasma membrane, leading to CD3Z/CD247 phosphorylation modulation (By similarity). Restricts the entry of human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion (PubMed:32641482). Also plays an essential role in placenta formation by acting as the main receptor for syncytin-A (SynA). Therefore, participates in the normal fusion of syncytiotrophoblast layer I (SynT-I) and in the proper morphogenesis of both fetal and maternal vasculatures within the placenta. May also act as a modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) activity (By similarity).
