UniprotID	Q6PIF2
Accession	Q6PIF2;B4DYD3
EntryName	SYCE2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Synaptonemal complex central element protein 2 (Central element synaptonemal complex protein 1)
GeneName	SYCE2 CESC1
Length	218
Function	Major component of the transverse central element of synaptonemal complexes (SCS), formed between homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase. Requires SYCP1 in order to be incorporated into the central element. May have a role in the synaptonemal complex assembly, stabilization and recombination (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
