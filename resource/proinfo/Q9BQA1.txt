Accession	Q9BQA1;B3KMW6;B4DP38;Q3LID2;Q53FU2;Q6JZZ5;Q96GK4;Q9BWY3
EntryName	MEP50_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methylosome protein WDR77 (Androgen receptor cofactor p44) (Methylosome protein 50) (MEP-50) (WD repeat-containing protein 77) (p44/Mep50)
GeneName	WDR77 MEP50 WD45 HKMT1069 Nbla10071
Length	342
Function	Non-catalytic component of the methylosome complex, composed of PRMT5, WDR77 and CLNS1A, which modifies specific arginines to dimethylarginines in several spliceosomal Sm proteins and histones (PubMed:11756452). This modification targets Sm proteins to the survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex for assembly into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein core particles. Might play a role in transcription regulation. The methylosome complex also methylates the Piwi proteins (PIWIL1, PIWIL2 and PIWIL4), methylation of Piwi proteins being required for the interaction with Tudor domain-containing proteins and subsequent localization to the meiotic nuage (PubMed:23071334).
