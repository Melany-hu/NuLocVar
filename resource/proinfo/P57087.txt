UniprotID	P57087
Accession	P57087;B2R6T9;B4DGT9;Q6UXG6;Q6YNC1
EntryName	JAM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Junctional adhesion molecule B (JAM-B) (Junctional adhesion molecule 2) (JAM-2) (Vascular endothelial junction-associated molecule) (VE-JAM) (CD antigen CD322)
GeneName	JAM2 C21orf43 VEJAM UNQ219/PRO245
Length	298
Function	Junctional adhesion protein that mediates heterotypic cell-cell interactions with its cognate receptor JAM3 to regulate different cellular processes (PubMed:11590146, PubMed:11823489, PubMed:24357068). Plays a role in homing and mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells within the bone marrow (PubMed:24357068). At the surface of bone marrow stromal cells, it contributes to the retention of the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells expressing JAM3 (PubMed:11590146, PubMed:24357068). Plays a central role in leukocytes extravasation by facilitating not only transmigration but also tethering and rolling of leukocytes along the endothelium (PubMed:12239159). Tethering and rolling of leukocytes are dependent on the binding by JAM2 of the integrin alpha-4/beta-1 (PubMed:12070135). Plays a role in spermatogenesis where JAM2 and JAM3, which are respectively expressed by Sertoli and germ cells, mediate an interaction between both cell types and play an essential role in the anchorage of germ cells onto Sertoli cells and the assembly of cell polarity complexes during spermatid differentiation (By similarity). Also functions as an inhibitory somatodendritic cue that prevents the myelination of non-axonal parts of neurons (By similarity). During myogenesis, it is involved in myocyte fusion (By similarity). May also play a role in angiogenesis (By similarity).
