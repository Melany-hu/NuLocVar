UniprotID	P47712
Accession	P47712;B1AKG4;Q29R80
EntryName	PA24A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) (Phospholipase A2 group IVA) [Includes: Phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) (Phosphatidylcholine 2-acylhydrolase); Lysophospholipase (EC 3.1.1.5)]
GeneName	PLA2G4A CPLA2 PLA2G4
Length	749
Function	Has primarily calcium-dependent phospholipase and lysophospholipase activities, with a major role in membrane lipid remodeling and biosynthesis of lipid mediators of the inflammatory response (PubMed:10358058, PubMed:14709560, PubMed:16617059, PubMed:17472963, PubMed:18451993, PubMed:27642067, PubMed:7794891, PubMed:8619991, PubMed:8702602, PubMed:9425121). Plays an important role in embryo implantation and parturition through its ability to trigger prostanoid production (By similarity). Preferentially hydrolyzes the ester bond of the fatty acyl group attached at sn-2 position of phospholipids (phospholipase A2 activity) (PubMed:10358058, PubMed:17472963, PubMed:18451993, PubMed:7794891, PubMed:8619991, PubMed:9425121). Selectively hydrolyzes sn-2 arachidonoyl group from membrane phospholipids, providing the precursor for eicosanoid biosynthesis via the cyclooxygenase pathway (PubMed:10358058, PubMed:17472963, PubMed:18451993, PubMed:7794891, PubMed:9425121). In an alternative pathway of eicosanoid biosynthesis, hydrolyzes sn-2 fatty acyl chain of eicosanoid lysophopholipids to release free bioactive eicosanoids (PubMed:27642067). Hydrolyzes the ester bond of the fatty acyl group attached at sn-1 position of phospholipids (phospholipase A1 activity) only if an ether linkage rather than an ester linkage is present at the sn-2 position. This hydrolysis is not stereospecific (PubMed:7794891). Has calcium-independent phospholipase A2 and lysophospholipase activities in the presence of phosphoinositides (PubMed:12672805). Has O-acyltransferase activity. Catalyzes the transfer of fatty acyl chains from phospholipids to a primary hydroxyl group of glycerol (sn-1 or sn-3), potentially contributing to monoacylglycerol synthesis (PubMed:7794891).
