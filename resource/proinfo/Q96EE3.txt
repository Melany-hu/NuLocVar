EntryName	SEH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleoporin SEH1 (GATOR2 complex protein SEH1) (Nup107-160 subcomplex subunit SEH1) (SEC13-like protein)
GeneName	SEH1L SEC13L SEH1
Length	360
Function	Component of the Nup107-160 subcomplex of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The Nup107-160 subcomplex is required for the assembly of a functional NPC (PubMed:15146057, PubMed:17363900). The Nup107-160 subcomplex is also required for normal kinetochore microtubule attachment, mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. This subunit plays a role in recruitment of the Nup107-160 subcomplex to the kinetochore (PubMed:15146057, PubMed:17363900).
Subcellular Location	Chromosome; Centromere; Kinetochore; Nucleus; Nuclear pore complex; Lysosome membrane
