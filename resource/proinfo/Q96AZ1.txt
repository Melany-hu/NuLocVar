UniprotID	Q96AZ1
Accession	Q96AZ1;Q9H749;Q9Y3W2
EntryName	EFMT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	EEF1A lysine methyltransferase 3 (EC 2.1.1.-) (Hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 557a) (Methyltransferase-like protein 21B) (Protein-lysine methyltransferase METTL21B) (eEF1A-KMT3)
GeneName	EEF1AKMT3 FAM119B HCA557A METTL21B
Length	226
Function	Protein-lysine methyltransferase that selectively mono-, di- and trimethylates 'Lys-165' of the translation elongation factors EEF1A1 and EEF1A2 in an aminoacyl-tRNA and GTP-dependent manner. EEF1A1 methylation by EEF1AKMT3 is dynamic as well as inducible by stress conditions, such as ER-stress, and plays a regulatory role on mRNA translation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome
