UniprotID	P16260
Accession	P16260;Q8N2U1
EntryName	GDC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 25 member 16 (Graves disease autoantigen) (GDA) (Graves disease carrier protein) (GDC) (Graves' didease protein) (hGP) (Mitochondrial solute carrier protein homolog)
GeneName	SLC25A16 GDA
Length	332
Function	May be involved in the transport of coenzyme A in the mitochondrial matrix (PubMed:11158296). Very little is known about the physiological function of this carrier (PubMed:11158296).
