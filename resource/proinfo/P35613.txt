Accession	P35613;A6NJW1;D3YLG5;Q7Z796;Q8IZL7
EntryName	BASI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Basigin (5F7) (Collagenase stimulatory factor) (Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer) (EMMPRIN) (Hepatoma-associated antigen) (HAb18G) (Leukocyte activation antigen M6) (OK blood group antigen) (Tumor cell-derived collagenase stimulatory factor) (TCSF) (CD antigen CD147)
GeneName	BSG UNQ6505/PRO21383
Length	385
Function	Essential for normal retinal maturation and development (By similarity). Acts as a retinal cell surface receptor for NXNL1 and plays an important role in NXNL1-mediated survival of retinal cone photoreceptors (PubMed:25957687). In association with glucose transporter SLC16A1/GLUT1 and NXNL1, promotes retinal cone survival by enhancing aerobic glycolysis and accelerating the entry of glucose into photoreceptors (PubMed:25957687). May act as a potent stimulator of IL6 secretion in multiple cell lines that include monocytes (PubMed:21620857).
