EntryName	STK24_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase 24 (EC 2.7.11.1) (Mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 3) (MST-3) (STE20-like kinase MST3) [Cleaved into: Serine/threonine-protein kinase 24 36 kDa subunit (Mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 3 N-terminal) (MST3/N); Serine/threonine-protein kinase 24 12 kDa subunit (Mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 3 C-terminal) (MST3/C)]
GeneName	STK24 MST3 STK3
Length	443
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase that acts on both serine and threonine residues and promotes apoptosis in response to stress stimuli and caspase activation. Mediates oxidative-stress-induced cell death by modulating phosphorylation of JNK1-JNK2 (MAPK8 and MAPK9), p38 (MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14) during oxidative stress. Plays a role in a staurosporine-induced caspase-independent apoptotic pathway by regulating the nuclear translocation of AIFM1 and ENDOG and the DNase activity associated with ENDOG. Phosphorylates STK38L on 'Thr-442' and stimulates its kinase activity. In association with STK26 negatively regulates Golgi reorientation in polarized cell migration upon RHO activation (PubMed:27807006). Also regulates cellular migration with alteration of PTPN12 activity and PXN phosphorylation: phosphorylates PTPN12 and inhibits its activity and may regulate PXN phosphorylation through PTPN12. May act as a key regulator of axon regeneration in the optic nerve and radial nerve. Part of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. STRIPAK complexes have critical roles in protein (de)phosphorylation and are regulators of multiple signaling pathways including Hippo, MAPK, nuclear receptor and cytoskeleton remodeling. Different types of STRIPAK complexes are involved in a variety of biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism and immune regulation (PubMed:18782753).
