UniprotID	P28476
Accession	P28476;A2BDE4;Q9H153
EntryName	GBRR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit rho-2 (GABA(A) receptor subunit rho-2) (GABAAR subunit rho-2) (GABA(C) receptor)
GeneName	GABRR2
Length	465
Function	Rho subunit of the pentameric ligand-gated chloride channels responsible for mediating the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain (By similarity). Rho-containing GABA-gated chloride channels are a subclass of GABA(A) receptors (GABAARs) entirely composed of rho subunits, where GABA molecules bind at the rho intersubunit interfaces (By similarity). When activated by GABA, rho-GABAARs selectively allow the flow of chloride anions across the cell membrane down their electrochemical gradient (By similarity). Rho-2 GABAARs may contribute to the regulation of glial development in the cerebellum by controlling extrasynaptic transmission. Rho-2 GABAARs are also involved in neuronal tonic (extrasynaptic) and phasic (synaptic) transmission in the Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum (By similarity). Rho-2 GABAARs expressed in retina may play a role in retinal neurotransmission (By similarity).
