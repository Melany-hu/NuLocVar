EntryName	STAU2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Double-stranded RNA-binding protein Staufen homolog 2
GeneName	STAU2
Length	570
Function	RNA-binding protein required for the microtubule-dependent transport of neuronal RNA from the cell body to the dendrite. As protein synthesis occurs within the dendrite, the localization of specific mRNAs to dendrites may be a prerequisite for neurite outgrowth and plasticity at sites distant from the cell body (By similarity).
