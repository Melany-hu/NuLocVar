ProteinName	Proline-rich protein 14
GeneName	PRR14
Length	585
Function	Functions in tethering peripheral heterochromatin to the nuclear lamina during interphase, possibly through the interaction with heterochromatin protein CBX5/HP1 alpha (PubMed:24209742). Might play a role in reattaching heterochromatin to the nuclear lamina at mitotic exit (PubMed:24209742). Promotes myoblast differentiation during skeletal myogenesis, possibly by stimulating transcription factor MyoD activity via binding to CBX5/HP1 alpha (PubMed:25906157). Involved in the positive regulation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway and in promoting cell proliferation, possibly via binding to GRB2 (PubMed:27041574).
