UniprotID	Q8WXF8
Accession	Q8WXF8;Q8NBR2;Q8NES1;Q8TAA8;Q96D35
EntryName	DEDD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-binding death effector domain-containing protein 2 (DED-containing protein FLAME-3) (FADD-like anti-apoptotic molecule 3)
GeneName	DEDD2 FLAME3 PSEC0004
Length	326
Function	May play a critical role in death receptor-induced apoptosis and may target CASP8 and CASP10 to the nucleus. May regulate degradation of intermediate filaments during apoptosis. May play a role in the general transcription machinery in the nucleus and might be an important regulator of the activity of GTF3C3.
