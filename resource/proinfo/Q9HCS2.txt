EntryName	CP4FC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 4F12 (EC 1.14.14.1) (CYPIVF12)
GeneName	CYP4F12 UNQ568/PRO1129
Length	524
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of endogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR; NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon hydrogen bonds, with preference for omega-2 position. Metabolizes (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (arachidonate) toward 18-hydroxy arachidonate (PubMed:11162607). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of PUFAs such as docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (PubMed:16112640). Has low omega-hydroxylase activity toward leukotriene B4 and arachidonate (PubMed:11162645). Involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics. Catalyzes the hydroxylation of the antihistamine drug ebastine (PubMed:11162645).
