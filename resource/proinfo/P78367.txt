UniprotID	P78367
Accession	P78367;Q2M2I7
EntryName	NKX32_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein Nkx-3.2 (Bagpipe homeobox protein homolog 1) (Homeobox protein NK-3 homolog B)
GeneName	NKX3-2 BAPX1 NKX3B
Length	333
Function	Transcriptional repressor that acts as a negative regulator of chondrocyte maturation. PLays a role in distal stomach development; required for proper antral-pyloric morphogenesis and development of antral-type epithelium. In concert with GSC, defines the structural components of the middle ear; required for tympanic ring and gonium development and in the regulation of the width of the malleus (By similarity).
