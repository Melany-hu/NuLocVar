UniprotID	P25786
Accession	P25786;A8K400;Q53YE8;Q9BRV9
EntryName	PSA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteasome subunit alpha type-1 (30 kDa prosomal protein) (PROS-30) (Macropain subunit C2) (Multicatalytic endopeptidase complex subunit C2) (Proteasome component C2) (Proteasome nu chain) (Proteasome subunit alpha-6) (alpha-6)
GeneName	PSMA1 HC2 NU PROS30 PSC2
Length	263
Function	Component of the 20S core proteasome complex involved in the proteolytic degradation of most intracellular proteins. This complex plays numerous essential roles within the cell by associating with different regulatory particles. Associated with two 19S regulatory particles, forms the 26S proteasome and thus participates in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Associated with the PA200 or PA28, the 20S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation. This type of proteolysis is required in several pathways including spermatogenesis (20S-PA200 complex) or generation of a subset of MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides (20S-PA28 complex).
