UniprotID	Q9UHC7
Accession	Q9UHC7;A4D1T7;B3KXB4;Q256Y7;Q59G11;Q6GSF1;Q9H0G0;Q9UEZ7;Q9UHW2
EntryName	MKRN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase makorin-1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 61) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase makorin-1)
GeneName	MKRN1 RNF61
Length	482
Function	E3 ubiquitin ligase catalyzing the covalent attachment of ubiquitin moieties onto substrate proteins. These substrates include FILIP1, p53/TP53, CDKN1A and TERT. Keeps cells alive by suppressing p53/TP53 under normal conditions, but stimulates apoptosis by repressing CDKN1A under stress conditions. Acts as a negative regulator of telomerase. Has negative and positive effects on RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription.
