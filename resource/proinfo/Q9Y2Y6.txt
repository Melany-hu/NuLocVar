UniprotID	Q9Y2Y6
Accession	Q9Y2Y6;E1P631;Q9UFK2
EntryName	TMM98_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 98 (Protein TADA1)
GeneName	TMEM98 UNQ536/PRO1079
Length	226
Function	Functions as a negative regulator of MYRF in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Interacts with the C-terminal of MYRF inhibiting MYRF self-cleavage and N-fragment nuclear translocation. The secreted form promotes differentiation of T helper 1 cells (Th1).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted; Secreted; Extracellular exosome; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
