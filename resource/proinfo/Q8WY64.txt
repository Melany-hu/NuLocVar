EntryName	MYLIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MYLIP (EC 2.3.2.27) (Inducible degrader of the LDL-receptor) (Idol) (Myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein) (MIR) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase MYLIP)
GeneName	MYLIP BZF1 IDOL BM-023 PP5242
Length	445
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC), LDLR, VLDLR and LRP8. Activity depends on E2 enzymes of the UBE2D family. Proteasomal degradation of MRLC leads to inhibit neurite outgrowth in presence of NGF by counteracting the stabilization of MRLC by saposin-like protein (CNPY2/MSAP) and reducing CNPY2-stimulated neurite outgrowth. Acts as a sterol-dependent inhibitor of cellular cholesterol uptake by mediating ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of LDLR.
