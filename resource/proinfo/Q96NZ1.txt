Function	Transcription factor essential for neural and some non-neural tissues development, such as retina and lung respectively. Binds to an 11-bp consensus sequence containing the invariant tetranucleotide 5'-ACGC-3'. During development of the central nervous system, is required to specify the amacrine and horizontal cell fates from multipotent retinal progenitors while suppressing the alternative photoreceptor cell fates through activating DLL4-NOTCH signaling. Also acts synergistically with ASCL1/MASH1 to activate DLL4-NOTCH signaling and drive commitment of p2 progenitors to the V2b interneuron fates during spinal cord neurogenesis. In development of non-neural tissues, plays an essential role in the specification of the atrioventricular canal and is indirectly required for patterning the distal airway during lung development (By similarity).
