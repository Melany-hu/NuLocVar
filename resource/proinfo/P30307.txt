EntryName	MPIP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	M-phase inducer phosphatase 3 (EC 3.1.3.48) (Dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25C)
GeneName	CDC25C
Length	473
Function	Functions as a dosage-dependent inducer in mitotic control. Tyrosine protein phosphatase required for progression of the cell cycle (PubMed:8119945). When phosphorylated, highly effective in activating G2 cells into prophase (PubMed:8119945). Directly dephosphorylates CDK1 and activates its kinase activity (PubMed:8119945).
