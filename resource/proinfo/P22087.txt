ProteinName	rRNA 2'-O-methyltransferase fibrillarin (EC 2.1.1.-) (34 kDa nucleolar scleroderma antigen) (Histone-glutamine methyltransferase) (U6 snRNA 2'-O-methyltransferase fibrillarin)
GeneName	FBL FIB1 FLRN
Length	321
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase that has the ability to methylate both RNAs and proteins (PubMed:24352239, PubMed:30540930, PubMed:32017898). Involved in pre-rRNA processing by catalyzing the site-specific 2'-hydroxyl methylation of ribose moieties in pre-ribosomal RNA (PubMed:30540930). Site specificity is provided by a guide RNA that base pairs with the substrate (By similarity). Methylation occurs at a characteristic distance from the sequence involved in base pairing with the guide RNA (By similarity). Probably catalyzes 2'-O-methylation of U6 snRNAs in box C/D RNP complexes (PubMed:32017898). U6 snRNA 2'-O-methylation is required for mRNA splicing fidelity (PubMed:32017898). Also acts as a protein methyltransferase by mediating methylation of 'Gln-105' of histone H2A (H2AQ104me), a modification that impairs binding of the FACT complex and is specifically present at 35S ribosomal DNA locus (PubMed:24352239, PubMed:30540930). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
