EntryName	EAA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (Sodium-dependent glutamate/aspartate transporter 1) (GLAST-1) (Solute carrier family 1 member 3)
GeneName	SLC1A3 EAAT1 GLAST GLAST1
Length	542
Function	Sodium-dependent, high-affinity amino acid transporter that mediates the uptake of L-glutamate and also L-aspartate and D-aspartate (PubMed:20477940, PubMed:26690923, PubMed:28032905, PubMed:28424515, PubMed:7521911, PubMed:8123008). Functions as a symporter that transports one amino acid molecule together with two or three Na(+) ions and one proton, in parallel with the counter-transport of one K(+) ion (PubMed:20477940). Mediates Cl(-) flux that is not coupled to amino acid transport; this avoids the accumulation of negative charges due to aspartate and Na(+) symport (PubMed:20477940). Plays a redundant role in the rapid removal of released glutamate from the synaptic cleft, which is essential for terminating the postsynaptic action of glutamate (By similarity).
