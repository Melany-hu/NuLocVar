EntryName	PSN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Presenilin-1 (PS-1) (EC 3.4.23.-) (Protein S182) [Cleaved into: Presenilin-1 NTF subunit; Presenilin-1 CTF subunit; Presenilin-1 CTF12 (PS1-CTF12)]
GeneName	PSEN1 AD3 PS1 PSNL1
Length	467
Function	Catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, an endoprotease complex that catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptors and APP (amyloid-beta precursor protein) (PubMed:10206644, PubMed:10545183, PubMed:10593990, PubMed:10811883, PubMed:10899933, PubMed:12679784, PubMed:12740439, PubMed:15274632, PubMed:20460383, PubMed:25043039, PubMed:26280335, PubMed:28269784, PubMed:30598546, PubMed:30630874). Requires the presence of the other members of the gamma-secretase complex for protease activity (PubMed:15274632, PubMed:25043039, PubMed:26280335, PubMed:30598546, PubMed:30630874). Plays a role in Notch and Wnt signaling cascades and regulation of downstream processes via its role in processing key regulatory proteins, and by regulating cytosolic CTNNB1 levels (PubMed:10593990, PubMed:10811883, PubMed:10899933, PubMed:9738936). Stimulates cell-cell adhesion via its interaction with CDH1; this stabilizes the complexes between CDH1 (E-cadherin) and its interaction partners CTNNB1 (beta-catenin), CTNND1 and JUP (gamma-catenin) (PubMed:11953314). Under conditions of apoptosis or calcium influx, cleaves CDH1 (PubMed:11953314). This promotes the disassembly of the complexes between CDH1 and CTNND1, JUP and CTNNB1, increases the pool of cytoplasmic CTNNB1, and thereby negatively regulates Wnt signaling (PubMed:11953314, PubMed:9738936). Required for normal embryonic brain and skeleton development, and for normal angiogenesis (By similarity). Mediates the proteolytic cleavage of EphB2/CTF1 into EphB2/CTF2 (PubMed:17428795, PubMed:28269784). The holoprotein functions as a calcium-leak channel that allows the passive movement of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum to cytosol and is therefore involved in calcium homeostasis (PubMed:16959576, PubMed:25394380). Involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth (PubMed:15004326, PubMed:20460383). Is a regulator of presynaptic facilitation, spike transmission and synaptic vesicles replenishment in a process that depends on gamma-secretase activity. It acts through the control of SYT7 presynaptic expression (By similarity).
