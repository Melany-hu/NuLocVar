UniprotID	P55259
Accession	P55259;A6NFM9;A6NJA8;Q13338;Q9UIF1
EntryName	GP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pancreatic secretory granule membrane major glycoprotein GP2 (Pancreatic zymogen granule membrane protein GP-2) (ZAP75)
GeneName	GP2
Length	537
Function	Functions as an intestinal M-cell transcytotic receptor specific for type-I-piliated bacteria that participates in the mucosal immune response toward these bacteria. At the apical membrane of M-cells it binds fimH, a protein of the bacteria type I pilus tip. Internalizes bound bacteria, like E.coli and S.typhimurium, from the lumen of the intestine and delivers them, through M-cells, to the underlying organized lymphoid follicles where they are captured by antigen-presenting dendritic cells to elicit a mucosal immune response.
Subcellular Location	Zymogen granule membrane; Secreted; Cell membrane; Apical cell membrane; Membrane raft; Endosome
