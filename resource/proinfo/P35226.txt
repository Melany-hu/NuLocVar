ProteinName	Polycomb complex protein BMI-1 (Polycomb group RING finger protein 4) (RING finger protein 51)
GeneName	BMI1 PCGF4 RNF51
Length	326
Function	Component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones; it mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119', rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility (PubMed:15386022, PubMed:16359901, PubMed:16714294, PubMed:21772249, PubMed:25355358, PubMed:26151332, PubMed:27827373). The complex composed of RNF2, UB2D3 and BMI1 binds nucleosomes, and has activity only with nucleosomal histone H2A (PubMed:21772249, PubMed:25355358). In the PRC1-like complex, regulates the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of RNF2/RING2 (PubMed:15386022, PubMed:21772249, PubMed:26151332).
