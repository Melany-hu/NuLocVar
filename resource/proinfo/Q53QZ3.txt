EntryName	RHG15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rho GTPase-activating protein 15 (ArhGAP15) (Rho-type GTPase-activating protein 15)
GeneName	ARHGAP15 BM-024 BM-030 BM-046
Length	475
Function	GTPase activator for the Rho-type GTPases by converting them to an inactive GDP-bound state. Has activity toward RAC1. Overexpression results in an increase in actin stress fibers and cell contraction.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Membrane
