UniprotID	Q9H9S0-2
Accession	Q9H9S0;D3DUU4;Q2TTG0;Q6JZS5
EntryName	NANOG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein NANOG (Homeobox transcription factor Nanog) (hNanog)
GeneName	NANOG
Length	289
Function	Transcription regulator involved in inner cell mass and embryonic stem (ES) cells proliferation and self-renewal. Imposes pluripotency on ES cells and prevents their differentiation towards extraembryonic endoderm and trophectoderm lineages. Blocks bone morphogenetic protein-induced mesoderm differentiation of ES cells by physically interacting with SMAD1 and interfering with the recruitment of coactivators to the active SMAD transcriptional complexes. Acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor. Binds optimally to the DNA consensus sequence 5'-TAAT-3' or 5'-CATTAN-3'. Binds to the POU5F1/OCT4 promoter (PubMed:25825768). Able to autorepress its expression in differentiating (ES) cells: binds to its own promoter following interaction with ZNF281/ZFP281, leading to recruitment of the NuRD complex and subsequent repression of expression. When overexpressed, promotes cells to enter into S phase and proliferation.
