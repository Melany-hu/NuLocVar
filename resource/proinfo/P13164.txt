UniprotID	P13164
Accession	P13164;Q15322;Q53XZ0
EntryName	IFM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (Dispanin subfamily A member 2a) (DSPA2a) (Interferon-induced protein 17) (Interferon-inducible protein 9-27) (Leu-13 antigen) (CD antigen CD225)
GeneName	IFITM1 CD225 IFI17
Length	125
Function	IFN-induced antiviral protein which inhibits the entry of viruses to the host cell cytoplasm, permitting endocytosis, but preventing subsequent viral fusion and release of viral contents into the cytosol. Active against multiple viruses, including influenza A virus, SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2), Marburg virus (MARV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Dengue virus (DNV), West Nile virus (WNV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (PubMed:26354436, PubMed:33270927). Can inhibit: influenza virus hemagglutinin protein-mediated viral entry, MARV and EBOV GP1,2-mediated viral entry and SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated viral entry. Also implicated in cell adhesion and control of cell growth and migration (PubMed:33270927). Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated syncytia formation (PubMed:33051876). Plays a key role in the antiproliferative action of IFN-gamma either by inhibiting the ERK activation or by arresting cell growth in G1 phase in a p53-dependent manner. Acts as a positive regulator of osteoblast differentiation. In hepatocytes, IFITM proteins act in a coordinated manner to restrict HCV infection by targeting the endocytosed HCV virion for lysosomal degradation (PubMed:26354436). IFITM2 and IFITM3 display anti-HCV activity that may complement the anti-HCV activity of IFITM1 by inhibiting the late stages of HCV entry, possibly in a coordinated manner by trapping the virion in the endosomal pathway and targeting it for degradation at the lysosome (PubMed:26354436).
