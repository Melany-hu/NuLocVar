EntryName	ELP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Elongator complex protein 3 (hELP3) (EC 2.3.1.311) (tRNA uridine(34) acetyltransferase)
GeneName	ELP3
Length	547
Function	Catalytic tRNA acetyltransferase subunit of the elongator complex which is required for multiple tRNA modifications, including mcm5U (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl uridine), mcm5s2U (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine), and ncm5U (5-carbamoylmethyl uridine) (PubMed:29415125). In the elongator complex, acts as a tRNA uridine(34) acetyltransferase by mediating formation of carboxymethyluridine in the wobble base at position 34 in tRNAs (By similarity). May also act as a protein lysine acetyltransferase by mediating acetylation of target proteins; such activity is however unclear in vivo and recent evidences suggest that ELP3 primarily acts as a tRNA acetyltransferase (PubMed:29415125). Involved in neurogenesis: regulates the migration and branching of projection neurons in the developing cerebral cortex, through a process depending on alpha-tubulin acetylation (PubMed:19185337). Required for acetylation of GJA1 in the developing cerebral cortex (By similarity).
