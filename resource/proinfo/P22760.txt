UniprotID	P22760
Accession	P22760;A8K3L3;D3DNJ6;Q8N1A9
EntryName	AAAD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Arylacetamide deacetylase (EC 3.1.1.3)
GeneName	AADAC DAC
Length	399
Function	Displays cellular triglyceride lipase activity in liver, increases the levels of intracellular fatty acids derived from the hydrolysis of newly formed triglyceride stores and plays a role in very low-density lipoprotein assembly. Displays serine esterase activity in liver. Deacetylates a variety of arylacetamide substrates, including xenobiotic compounds and procarcinogens, converting them to the primary arylamide compounds and increasing their toxicity.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Microsome membrane
