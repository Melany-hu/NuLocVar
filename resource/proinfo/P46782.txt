UniprotID	P46782
Accession	P46782;B2R4T2;Q96BN0
EntryName	RS5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein uS7 (40S ribosomal protein S5) [Cleaved into: Small ribosomal subunit protein uS7, N-terminally processed (40S ribosomal protein S5, N-terminally processed)]
GeneName	RPS5
Length	204
Function	Component of the small ribosomal subunit (PubMed:23636399). The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:23636399). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
