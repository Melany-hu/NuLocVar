UniprotID	P03915
Accession	P03915;Q34773;Q8WCY3
EntryName	NU5M_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 5 (EC 7.1.1.2) (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5)
GeneName	MT-ND5 MTND5 NADH5 ND5
Length	603
Function	Core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) which catalyzes electron transfer from NADH through the respiratory chain, using ubiquinone as an electron acceptor (PubMed:15250827). Essential for the catalytic activity and assembly of complex I (PubMed:15250827).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
