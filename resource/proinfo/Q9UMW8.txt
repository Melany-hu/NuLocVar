EntryName	UBP18_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubl carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 18 (EC 3.4.19.12) (43 kDa ISG15-specific protease) (hUBP43) (ISG15-specific-processing protease) (Ubl thioesterase 18)
GeneName	USP18 ISG43
Length	372
Function	Interferon-induced ISG15-specific protease that plays a crucial role for maintaining a proper balance of ISG15-conjugated proteins in cells (PubMed:11788588). Regulates protein ISGylation by efficiently cleaving ISG15 conjugates linked via isopeptide bonds. Regulates T-cell activation and T-helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation by deubiquitinating TAK1, likely to keep TAK1-TAB complexes in steady conditions (PubMed:23825189). In turn, restricts activation of NF-kappa-B, NFAT, and JNK as well as expression of IL2 in T-cells after TCR activation (PubMed:23825189). Acts as a molecular adapter with USP20 to promote innate antiviral response through deubiquitinating STING1 (PubMed:27801882). Involved also in the negative regulation of the inflammatory response triggered by type I interferon (PubMed:27325888, PubMed:28165510). Upon recruitment by STAT2 to the type I interferon receptor subunit IFNAR2 interferes with the assembly of the ternary interferon-IFNAR1-IFNAR2 complex and acts as a negative regulator of the type I interferon signaling pathway (PubMed:28165510).
