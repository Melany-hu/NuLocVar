EntryName	RCAN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcipressin-1 (Adapt78) (Down syndrome critical region protein 1) (Myocyte-enriched calcineurin-interacting protein 1) (MCIP1) (Regulator of calcineurin 1)
GeneName	RCAN1 ADAPT78 CSP1 DSC1 DSCR1
Length	252
Function	Inhibits calcineurin-dependent transcriptional responses by binding to the catalytic domain of calcineurin A (PubMed:12809556). Could play a role during central nervous system development (By similarity).
