EntryName	DHDDS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase complex subunit DHDDS (EC 2.5.1.87) (Cis-isoprenyltransferase) (CIT) (Cis-IPTase) (Cis-prenyltransferase subunit hCIT) (Epididymis tissue protein Li 189m)
GeneName	DHDDS HDS
Length	333
Function	With NUS1, forms the dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase (DDS) complex, an essential component of the dolichol monophosphate (Dol-P) biosynthetic machinery (PubMed:25066056, PubMed:28842490, PubMed:32817466, PubMed:33077723). Both subunits contribute to enzymatic activity, i.e. condensation of multiple copies of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to produce dehydrodolichyl diphosphate (Dedol-PP), a precursor of dolichol phosphate which is utilized as a sugar carrier in protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (PubMed:25066056, PubMed:28842490, PubMed:32817466, PubMed:33077723). Synthesizes long-chain polyprenols, mostly of C95 and C100 chain length (PubMed:32817466). Regulates the glycosylation and stability of nascent NPC2, thereby promoting trafficking of LDL-derived cholesterol (PubMed:21572394).
