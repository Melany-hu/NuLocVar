UniprotID	P12018
Accession	P12018;B5MCG2
EntryName	VPREB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Immunoglobulin iota chain (CD179 antigen-like family member A) (Protein VPreB1) (V(pre)B protein) (VpreB protein) (CD antigen CD179a)
GeneName	VPREB1 VPREB
Length	145
Function	Associates with the Ig-mu chain to form a molecular complex that is expressed on the surface of pre-B-cells. This complex presumably regulates Ig gene rearrangements in the early steps of B-cell differentiation.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum
