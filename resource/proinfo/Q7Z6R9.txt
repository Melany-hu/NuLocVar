UniprotID	Q7Z6R9
Accession	Q7Z6R9;Q8IWX0
EntryName	AP2D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor AP-2-delta (AP2-delta) (Activating enhancer-binding protein 2-delta) (Transcription factor AP-2-beta-like 1)
GeneName	TFAP2D TFAP2BL1
Length	452
Function	Sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that interacts with inducible viral and cellular enhancer elements to regulate transcription of selected genes. AP-2 factors bind to the consensus sequence 5'-GCCNNNGGC-3' and activate genes involved in a large spectrum of important biological functions including proper eye, face, body wall, limb and neural tube development. They also suppress a number of genes including MCAM/MUC18, C/EBP alpha and MYC (By similarity).
