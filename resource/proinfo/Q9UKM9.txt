UniprotID	Q9UKM9
Accession	Q9UKM9;Q14621;Q2M365;Q5QPL8;Q9BQX6;Q9UJE3
EntryName	RALY_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA-binding protein Raly (Autoantigen p542) (Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C-like 2) (hnRNP core protein C-like 2) (hnRNP associated with lethal yellow protein homolog)
GeneName	RALY HNRPCL2 P542
Length	306
Function	RNA-binding protein that acts as a transcriptional cofactor for cholesterol biosynthetic genes in the liver. Binds the lipid-responsive non-coding RNA LeXis and is required for LeXis-mediated effect on cholesterogenesis (By similarity). May be a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) (PubMed:9376072).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
