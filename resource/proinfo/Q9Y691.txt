UniprotID	Q9Y691
Accession	Q9Y691
EntryName	KCMB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium-activated potassium channel subunit beta-2 (BK channel subunit beta-2) (BKbeta2) (Hbeta2) (Calcium-activated potassium channel, subfamily M subunit beta-2) (Charybdotoxin receptor subunit beta-2) (Hbeta3) (K(VCA)beta-2) (Maxi K channel subunit beta-2) (Slo-beta-2)
GeneName	KCNMB2
Length	235
Function	Regulatory subunit of the calcium activated potassium KCNMA1 (maxiK) channel. Modulates the calcium sensitivity and gating kinetics of KCNMA1, thereby contributing to KCNMA1 channel diversity. Acts as a negative regulator that confers rapid and complete inactivation of KCNMA1 channel complex. May participate in KCNMA1 inactivation in chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland or in hippocampal CA1 neurons.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
