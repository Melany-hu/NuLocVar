EntryName	TBAL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tubulin alpha chain-like 3 (EC 3.6.5.-)
GeneName	TUBAL3
Length	446
Function	Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules, a cylinder consisting of laterally associated linear protofilaments composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers. Microtubules grow by the addition of GTP-tubulin dimers to the microtubule end, where a stabilizing cap forms. Below the cap, tubulin dimers are in GDP-bound state, owing to GTPase activity of alpha-tubulin.
