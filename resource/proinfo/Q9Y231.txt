UniprotID	Q9Y231
Accession	Q9Y231;Q5T0W4
EntryName	FUT9_HUMAN
ProteinName	4-galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminide 3-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 9 (EC 2.4.1.152) (Fucosyltransferase 9) (Fucosyltransferase IX) (Fuc-TIX) (FucT-IX) (Galactoside 3-L-fucosyltransferase)
GeneName	FUT9
Length	359
Function	Catalyzes alpha(1->3) linkage of fucosyl moiety transferred from GDP-beta-L-fucose to N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) within type 2 lactosamine (LacNAc, beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-beta-D-GlcNAc-) glycan attached to glycolipids and N- or O-linked glycoproteins. Fucosylates distal type 2 LacNAc and its fucosylated (H-type 2 LacNAc) and sialylated (sialyl-type 2 LacNAc) derivatives to form Lewis x (Lex) (CD15) and Lewis y (Ley) antigenic epitopes involved in cell adhesion and differentiation (PubMed:10386598, PubMed:10622713, PubMed:11278338, PubMed:12107078, PubMed:16282604, PubMed:17335083, PubMed:18395013, PubMed:23192350, PubMed:23263199, PubMed:29593094, PubMed:37202521). Generates Lex epitopes in the brain, presumably playing a role in the maintenance of neuronal stemness and neurite outgrowth in progenitor neural cells (By similarity) (PubMed:17335083, PubMed:23000574). Fucosylates the internal type 2 LacNAc unit of the polylactosamine chain to form VIM-2 antigen that serves as recognition epitope for SELE (PubMed:23192350). Can also modify milk oligosaccharides, in particular type 2 tetrasaccharide LNnT (PubMed:37202521).
