UniprotID	Q8TAC9
Accession	Q8TAC9;B3KPJ7;B7Z762;D3DW71;Q8N3M4
EntryName	SCAM5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 5 (Secretory carrier membrane protein 5) (hSCAMP5)
GeneName	SCAMP5
Length	235
Function	Required for the calcium-dependent exocytosis of signal sequence-containing cytokines such as CCL5. Probably acts in cooperation with the SNARE machinery. May play a role in accumulation of expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) protein huntingtin (HTT) in case of endoplasmic reticulum stress by inhibiting the endocytosis pathway.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane; Recycling endosome membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane
