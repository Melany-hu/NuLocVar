UniprotID	Q9NWT1
Accession	Q9NWT1;Q5T4J2;Q96QJ8;Q96T87
EntryName	PK1IP_HUMAN
ProteinName	p21-activated protein kinase-interacting protein 1 (PAK/PLC-interacting protein 1) (hPIP1) (PAK1-interacting protein 1) (WD repeat-containing protein 84)
GeneName	PAK1IP1 PIP1 WDR84
Length	392
Function	Negatively regulates the PAK1 kinase. PAK1 is a member of the PAK kinase family, which has been shown to play a positive role in the regulation of signaling pathways involving MAPK8 and RELA. PAK1 exists as an inactive homodimer, which is activated by binding of small GTPases such as CDC42 to an N-terminal regulatory domain. PAK1IP1 also binds to the N-terminus of PAK1, and inhibits the specific activation of PAK1 by CDC42. May be involved in ribosomal large subunit assembly (PubMed:24120868).
