UniprotID	P30101
Accession	P30101;Q13453;Q14255;Q8IYF8;Q9UMU7
EntryName	PDIA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein disulfide-isomerase A3 (EC 5.3.4.1) (58 kDa glucose-regulated protein) (58 kDa microsomal protein) (p58) (Disulfide isomerase ER-60) (Endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 57) (ER protein 57) (ERp57) (Endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 60) (ER protein 60) (ERp60)
GeneName	PDIA3 ERP57 ERP60 GRP58
Length	505
Function	Protein disulfide isomerase that catalyzes the formation, isomerization, and reduction or oxidation of disulfide bonds in client proteins and functions as a protein folding chaperone (PubMed:11825568, PubMed:16193070, PubMed:27897272, PubMed:36104323, PubMed:7487104). Core component of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) peptide loading complex where it functions as an essential folding chaperone for TAPBP. Through TAPBP, assists the dynamic assembly of the MHC I complex with high affinity antigens in the endoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, plays a crucial role in the presentation of antigens to cytotoxic T cells in adaptive immunity (PubMed:35948544, PubMed:36104323).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum; Endoplasmic reticulum lumen; Melanosome
