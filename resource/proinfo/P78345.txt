UniprotID	P78345
Accession	P78345;B3KPY0;D3DRT8;Q53F71;Q8NHS8
EntryName	RPP38_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease P protein subunit p38 (RNaseP protein p38)
GeneName	RPP38
Length	283
Function	Component of ribonuclease P, a ribonucleoprotein complex that generates mature tRNA molecules by cleaving their 5'-ends (PubMed:10444065, PubMed:30454648, PubMed:9037013, PubMed:9630247). Also a component of the MRP ribonuclease complex, which cleaves pre-rRNA sequences (PubMed:28115465).
