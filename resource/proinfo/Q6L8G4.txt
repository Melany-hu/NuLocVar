UniprotID	Q6L8G4
Accession	Q6L8G4
EntryName	KR511_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 5-11 (Keratin-associated protein 5.11) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 5.11)
GeneName	KRTAP5-11 KAP5.11 KRTAP5.11
Length	156
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated protein (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
