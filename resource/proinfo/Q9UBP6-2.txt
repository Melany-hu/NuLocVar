UniprotID	Q9UBP6-2
Accession	Q9UBP6;B2RBX1;H7BXF2;Q14105;Q53FS9
EntryName	TRMB_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.33) (Methyltransferase-like protein 1) (mRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase) (EC 2.1.1.-) (miRNA (guanine-N(7)-)-methyltransferase) (EC 2.1.1.-) (tRNA (guanine(46)-N(7))-methyltransferase) (tRNA(m7G46)-methyltransferase)
GeneName	METTL1 C12orf1
Length	155
Function	Catalytic component of METTL1-WDR4 methyltransferase complex that mediates the formation of N(7)-methylguanine in a subset of RNA species, such as tRNAs, mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) (PubMed:12403464, PubMed:31031083, PubMed:31031084, PubMed:36599982, PubMed:36599985, PubMed:37369656, PubMed:37379838). Catalyzes the formation of N(7)-methylguanine at position 46 (m7G46) in a large subset of tRNAs that contain the 5'-RAGGU-3' motif within the variable loop (PubMed:12403464, PubMed:34352206, PubMed:34352207, PubMed:36599982, PubMed:36599985, PubMed:37369656). M7G46 interacts with C13-G22 in the D-loop to stabilize tRNA tertiary structure and protect tRNAs from decay (PubMed:36599982, PubMed:36599985). Also acts as a methyltransferase for a subset of internal N(7)-methylguanine in mRNAs (PubMed:31031084, PubMed:37379838). Internal N(7)-methylguanine methylation of mRNAs in response to stress promotes their relocalization to stress granules, thereby suppressing their translation (PubMed:31031084, PubMed:37379838). Also methylates a specific subset of miRNAs, such as let-7 (PubMed:31031083). N(7)-methylguanine methylation of let-7 miRNA promotes let-7 miRNA processing by disrupting an inhibitory secondary structure within the primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA) (PubMed:31031083). Acts as a regulator of embryonic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation (By similarity).
