EntryName	EXD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Exonuclease 3'-5' domain-containing protein 2 (EC 3.1.11.1) (3'-5' exoribonuclease EXD2) (EC 3.1.13.-) (Exonuclease 3'-5' domain-like-containing protein 2)
GeneName	EXD2 C14orf114 EXDL2
Length	621
Function	Exonuclease that has both 3'-5' exoribonuclease and exodeoxyribonuclease activities, depending on the divalent metal cation used as cofactor (PubMed:29335528, PubMed:31127291). In presence of Mg(2+), only shows 3'-5' exoribonuclease activity, while it shows both exoribonuclease and exodeoxyribonuclease activities in presence of Mn(2+) (PubMed:29335528, PubMed:31127291). Acts as an exoribonuclease in mitochondrion, possibly by regulating ATP production and mitochondrial translation (PubMed:29335528). Also involved in the response to DNA damage (PubMed:26807646, PubMed:31255466). Acts as 3'-5' exodeoxyribonuclease for double-strand breaks resection and efficient homologous recombination (PubMed:20603073, PubMed:26807646). Plays a key role in controlling the initial steps of chromosomal break repair, it is recruited to chromatin in a damage-dependent manner and functionally interacts with the MRN complex to accelerate resection through its 3'-5' exonuclease activity, which efficiently processes double-stranded DNA substrates containing nicks (PubMed:26807646). Also involved in response to replicative stress: recruited to stalled forks and is required to stabilize and restart stalled replication forks by restraining excessive fork regression, thereby suppressing their degradation (PubMed:31255466).
