UniprotID	Q9P1T7-1
Accession	Q9P1T7;Q9P1T6
EntryName	MDFIC_HUMAN
ProteinName	MyoD family inhibitor domain-containing protein (I-mfa domain-containing protein) (hIC)
GeneName	MDFIC
Length	355
Function	Required to control the activity of various transcription factors through their sequestration in the cytoplasm. Retains nuclear Zic proteins ZIC1, ZIC2 and ZIC3 in the cytoplasm and inhibits their transcriptional activation (By similarity). Modulates the expression from both cellular and viral promoters. Down-regulates Tat-dependent transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) LTR by interacting with HIV-1 Tat and Rev and impairing their nuclear import, probably by rendering the NLS domains inaccessible to importin-beta (PubMed:12944466, PubMed:16260749, Ref.6). Also stimulates activation of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) LTR (PubMed:10671520). Binds to the axin complex, resulting in an increase in the level of free beta-catenin (PubMed:12192039). Affects axin regulation of the WNT and JNK signaling pathways (PubMed:12192039). Has a role in the development of lymphatic vessel valves. It is required to promote lymphatic endothelial cell migration, in a process that involves down-regulation of integrin beta 1 activation and control of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (By similarity) (PubMed:35235341).
