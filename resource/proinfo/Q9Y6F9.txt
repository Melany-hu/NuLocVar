UniprotID	Q9Y6F9
Accession	Q9Y6F9;Q9H1J6;Q9H238
EntryName	WNT6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Wnt-6
GeneName	WNT6
Length	365
Function	Ligand for members of the frizzled family of seven transmembrane receptors. Probable developmental protein. May be a signaling molecule which affects the development of discrete regions of tissues. Is likely to signal over only few cell diameters. Together with CAV1 may promote chemoresistance of gastric cancer cells to DNA-damaging anthracycline drugs through the activation of the canonical Wnt receptor signaling pathway.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Extracellular space; Extracellular matrix
