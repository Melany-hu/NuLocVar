UniprotID	Q7L0Q8
Accession	Q7L0Q8;B1AKN1;Q59FE9;Q8TDQ2
EntryName	RHOU_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoU (CDC42-like GTPase 1) (GTP-binding protein-like 1) (Rho GTPase-like protein ARHU) (Ryu GTPase) (Wnt-1 responsive Cdc42 homolog 1) (WRCH-1)
GeneName	RHOU ARHU CDC42L1 G28K WRCH1 SB128
Length	258
Function	Acts upstream of PAK1 to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, adhesion turnover and increase cell migration. Stimulates quiescent cells to reenter the cell cycle. Has no detectable GTPase activity but its high intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange activity suggests it is constitutively GTP-bound. Plays a role in the regulation of cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization. Required in the control of cell shape.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Cell junction; Focal adhesion; Cell projection; Podosome
