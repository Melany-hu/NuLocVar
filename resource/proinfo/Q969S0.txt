UniprotID	Q969S0
Accession	Q969S0;A4D1P3;A6NNS4;Q53GQ7;Q8TCU7;Q96K33
EntryName	S35B4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleotide sugar transporter SLC35B4 (Solute carrier family 35 member B4) (UDP-xylose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter) (YEA4 homolog)
GeneName	SLC35B4 YEA4 PSEC0055
Length	331
Function	Antiporter that transports nucleotide sugars across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in exchange for another nucleotide sugar. May couple UDP-alpha-D-glucuronate (UDP-GlcA) or UDP-alpha-D-xylose (UDP-Xyl) efflux to UDP-alpha-D-glucuronate (UDP-GlcA) influx into the ER lumen, which in turn stimulates glucuronidation and excretion of endobiotics and xenobiotics.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
