UniprotID	Q9NR55
Accession	Q9NR55
EntryName	BATF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor ATF-like 3 (B-ATF-3) (21 kDa small nuclear factor isolated from T-cells) (Jun dimerization protein p21SNFT)
GeneName	BATF3 SNFT
Length	127
Function	AP-1 family transcription factor that controls the differentiation of CD8(+) thymic conventional dendritic cells in the immune system. Required for development of CD8-alpha(+) classical dendritic cells (cDCs) and related CD103(+) dendritic cells that cross-present antigens to CD8 T-cells and produce interleukin-12 (IL12) in response to pathogens (By similarity). Acts via the formation of a heterodimer with JUN family proteins that recognizes and binds DNA sequence 5'-TGATCA-3' and regulates expression of target genes.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
