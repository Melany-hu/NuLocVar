EntryName	CHMP7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Charged multivesicular body protein 7 (Chromatin-modifying protein 7)
GeneName	CHMP7
Length	453
Function	ESCRT-III-like protein required to recruit the ESCRT-III complex to the nuclear envelope (NE) during late anaphase (PubMed:26040712). Together with SPAST, the ESCRT-III complex promotes NE sealing and mitotic spindle disassembly during late anaphase (PubMed:26040712, PubMed:28242692). Recruited to the reforming NE during anaphase by LEMD2 (PubMed:28242692). Plays a role in the endosomal sorting pathway (PubMed:16856878).
