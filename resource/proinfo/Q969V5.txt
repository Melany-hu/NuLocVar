ProteinName	Mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase activator of NFKB 1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (E3 SUMO-protein ligase MUL1) (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MUL1) (Growth inhibition and death E3 ligase) (Mitochondrial-anchored protein ligase) (Protein Hades) (Putative NF-kappa-B-activating protein 266) (RING finger protein 218) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase NFKB 1)
GeneName	MUL1 C1orf166 GIDE MAPL MULAN RNF218
Length	352
Function	Exhibits weak E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (PubMed:18591963, PubMed:19407830, PubMed:22410793). E3 ubiquitin ligases accept ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester and then directly transfer the ubiquitin to targeted substrates (PubMed:18591963, PubMed:19407830, PubMed:22410793). Can ubiquitinate AKT1 preferentially at 'Lys-284' involving 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination and seems to be involved in regulation of Akt signaling by targeting phosphorylated Akt to proteasomal degradation (PubMed:22410793). Mediates polyubiquitination of cytoplasmic TP53 at 'Lys-24' which targets TP53 for proteasomal degradation, thus reducing TP53 levels in the cytoplasm and mitochondrion (PubMed:21597459). Proposed to preferentially act as a SUMO E3 ligase at physiological concentrations (PubMed:19407830). Plays a role in the control of mitochondrial morphology by promoting mitochondrial fragmentation, and influences mitochondrial localization (PubMed:18207745, PubMed:18213395, PubMed:19407830). Likely to promote mitochondrial fission through negatively regulating the mitochondrial fusion proteins MFN1 and MFN2, acting in a pathway that is parallel to the PRKN/PINK1 regulatory pathway (PubMed:24898855). May also be involved in the sumoylation of the membrane fission protein DNM1L (PubMed:18207745, PubMed:19407830). Inhibits cell growth (PubMed:18591963, PubMed:22410793). When overexpressed, activates JNK through MAP3K7/TAK1 and induces caspase-dependent apoptosis (PubMed:23399697). Involved in the modulation of innate immune defense against viruses by inhibiting RIGI-dependent antiviral response (PubMed:23399697). Can mediate RIGI sumoylation and disrupt its polyubiquitination (PubMed:23399697).
