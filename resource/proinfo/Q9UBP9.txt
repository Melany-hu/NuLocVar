Accession	Q9UBP9;B2RB51;B4DQ40;B8ZZ72;D3DPH1;E9PB86;Q53PC1;Q53RF3;Q9BVL3
EntryName	GULP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	PTB domain-containing engulfment adapter protein 1 (Cell death protein 6 homolog) (PTB domain adapter protein CED-6) (Protein GULP)
GeneName	GULP1 CED6 GULP
Length	304
Function	May function as an adapter protein. Required for efficient phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Modulates cellular glycosphingolipid and cholesterol transport. May play a role in the internalization and endosomal trafficking of various LRP1 ligands, such as PSAP. Increases cellular levels of GTP-bound ARF6.
