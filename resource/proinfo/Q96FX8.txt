UniprotID	Q96FX8
Accession	Q96FX8;B2RB73;E1P590;Q8IWS3;Q8N1J6;Q8NC16;Q9H1C5;Q9H230
EntryName	PERP_HUMAN
ProteinName	p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22 (Keratinocyte-associated protein 1) (KCP-1) (P53-induced protein PIGPC1) (Transmembrane protein THW)
GeneName	PERP KCP1 KRTCAP1 PIGPC1 THW
Length	193
Function	Component of intercellular desmosome junctions (By similarity). Plays a role in stratified epithelial integrity and cell-cell adhesion by promoting desmosome assembly (By similarity). Thereby plays a role in barrier function of the skin against infection (By similarity). Plays a role in mammary epithelial tissue homeostasis and remodeling during and after pregnancy, potentially via its involvement in desmosome cell-cell junctions (By similarity). Required for tooth enamel development via facilitating desmosome-mediated ameloblast adhesion to the stratum intermedium during the transitional stage of amelogenesis (By similarity). May also play a role in downstream transcriptional regulation of other genes involved in amelogenesis such as AMBN, ENAM, MMP20 and KLK4 (By similarity). Plays a role as an effector in the TP53-dependent apoptotic pathway (By similarity). Positively regulates apoptosis in T-helper 17 (Th17) cell populations via caspase-dependent signaling (By similarity). Promotes neutrophil transepithelial migration in response to chemoattractants such as hepoxilin A3 (HXA3), N-Formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and CXCL8/IL-8 (PubMed:25486861). Required for neutrophil transepithelial migration in response to S.typhimurium infection (PubMed:25486861). May act as a positive regulator of endothelial cell apoptosis in response to blood flow-derived shear stress (By similarity).
