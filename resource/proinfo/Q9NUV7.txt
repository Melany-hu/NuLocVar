EntryName	SPTC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine palmitoyltransferase 3 (EC 2.3.1.50) (Long chain base biosynthesis protein 2b) (LCB2b) (Long chain base biosynthesis protein 3) (LCB 3) (Serine-palmitoyl-CoA transferase 3) (SPT 3)
GeneName	SPTLC3 C20orf38 SPTLC2L
Length	552
Function	Component of the serine palmitoyltransferase multisubunit enzyme (SPT) that catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid biosynthesis by condensing L-serine and activated acyl-CoA (most commonly palmitoyl-CoA) to form long-chain bases (PubMed:19416851, PubMed:19648650). The SPT complex is composed of SPTLC1, SPTLC2 or SPTLC3 and SPTSSA or SPTSSB. Within this complex, the heterodimer consisting of SPTLC1 and SPTLC2/SPTLC3 forms the catalytic core. The composition of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex determines the substrate preference (PubMed:19416851). The SPTLC1-SPTLC2-SPTSSA complex shows a strong preference for C16-CoA substrate, while the SPTLC1-SPTLC3-SPTSSA isozyme uses both C14-CoA and C16-CoA as substrates, with a slight preference for C14-CoA. The SPTLC1-SPTLC2-SPTSSB complex shows a strong preference for C18-CoA substrate, while the SPTLC1-SPTLC3-SPTSSB isozyme displays an ability to use a broader range of acyl-CoAs, without apparent preference (PubMed:19416851, PubMed:19648650).
