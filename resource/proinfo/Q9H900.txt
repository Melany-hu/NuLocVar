EntryName	ZWILC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein zwilch homolog (hZwilch)
GeneName	ZWILCH
Length	591
Function	Essential component of the mitotic checkpoint, which prevents cells from prematurely exiting mitosis. Required for the assembly of the dynein-dynactin and MAD1-MAD2 complexes onto kinetochores. Its function related to the spindle assembly machinery is proposed to depend on its association in the mitotic RZZ complex (PubMed:15824131).
