UniprotID	Q9Y6K1-3
Accession	Q9Y6K1;E9PEB8;Q86TE8;Q86XF5;Q8IZV0;Q8WXU9
EntryName	DNM3A_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A (Dnmt3a) (EC 2.1.1.37) (Cysteine methyltransferase DNMT3A) (EC 2.1.1.-) (DNA methyltransferase HsaIIIA) (DNA MTase HsaIIIA) (M.HsaIIIA)
GeneName	DNMT3A
Length	166
Function	Required for genome-wide de novo methylation and is essential for the establishment of DNA methylation patterns during development (PubMed:12138111, PubMed:16357870, PubMed:30478443). DNA methylation is coordinated with methylation of histones (PubMed:12138111, PubMed:16357870, PubMed:30478443). It modifies DNA in a non-processive manner and also methylates non-CpG sites (PubMed:12138111, PubMed:16357870, PubMed:30478443). May preferentially methylate DNA linker between 2 nucleosomal cores and is inhibited by histone H1 (By similarity). Plays a role in paternal and maternal imprinting (By similarity). Required for methylation of most imprinted loci in germ cells (By similarity). Acts as a transcriptional corepressor for ZBTB18 (By similarity). Recruited to trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3) sites (By similarity). Can actively repress transcription through the recruitment of HDAC activity (By similarity). Also has weak auto-methylation activity on Cys-710 in absence of DNA (By similarity).
