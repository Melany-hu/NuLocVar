EntryName	ERO1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	ERO1-like protein beta (ERO1-L-beta) (EC 1.8.4.-) (Endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase beta) (Endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin-1-like protein B) (Oxidoreductin-1-L-beta)
GeneName	ERO1B ERO1LB
Length	467
Function	Oxidoreductase involved in disulfide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Efficiently reoxidizes P4HB/PDI, the enzyme catalyzing protein disulfide formation, in order to allow P4HB to sustain additional rounds of disulfide formation. Other protein disulfide isomerase family members can also be reoxidized, but at lower rates compared to P4HB, including PDIA2 (50% of P4HB reoxidation rate), as well as PDIA3, PDIA4, PDIA6 and NXNDC12 (<10%). Following P4HB reoxidation, passes its electrons to molecular oxygen via FAD, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell. May be involved in oxidative proinsulin folding in pancreatic cells, hence may play a role in glucose homeostasis.
