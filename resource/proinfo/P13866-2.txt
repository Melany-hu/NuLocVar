UniprotID	P13866-2
Accession	P13866;B2R7E2;B7Z4Q9;B7ZA69
EntryName	SC5A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (Na(+)/glucose cotransporter 1) (High affinity sodium-glucose cotransporter) (Solute carrier family 5 member 1)
GeneName	SLC5A1 NAGT SGLT1
Length	537
Function	Electrogenic Na(+)-coupled sugar symporter that actively transports D-glucose or D-galactose at the plasma membrane, with a Na(+) to sugar coupling ratio of 2:1. Transporter activity is driven by a transmembrane Na(+) electrochemical gradient set by the Na(+)/K(+) pump (PubMed:20980548, PubMed:34880492, PubMed:35077764, PubMed:8563765, PubMed:37217492). Has a primary role in the transport of dietary monosaccharides from enterocytes to blood. Responsible for the absorption of D-glucose or D-galactose across the apical brush-border membrane of enterocytes, whereas basolateral exit is provided by GLUT2. Additionally, functions as a D-glucose sensor in enteroendocrine cells, triggering the secretion of the incretins GCG and GIP that control food intake and energy homeostasis (By similarity) (PubMed:8563765). Together with SGLT2, functions in reabsorption of D-glucose from glomerular filtrate, playing a nonredundant role in the S3 segment of the proximal tubules (By similarity). Transports D-glucose into endometrial epithelial cells, controlling glycogen synthesis and nutritional support for the embryo as well as the decidual transformation of endometrium prior to conception (PubMed:28974690). Acts as a water channel enabling passive water transport across the plasma membrane in response to the osmotic gradient created upon sugar and Na(+) uptake. Has high water conductivity, comparable to aquaporins, and therefore is expected to play an important role in transepithelial water permeability, especially in the small intestine.
