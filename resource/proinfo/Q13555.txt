EntryName	KCC2G_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit gamma (CaM kinase II subunit gamma) (CaMK-II subunit gamma) (EC 2.7.11.17)
GeneName	CAMK2G CAMK CAMK-II CAMKG
Length	558
Function	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase that functions autonomously after Ca(2+)/calmodulin-binding and autophosphorylation, and is involved in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) transport in skeletal muscle and may function in dendritic spine and synapse formation and neuronal plasticity (PubMed:16690701). In slow-twitch muscles, is involved in regulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) transport and in fast-twitch muscle participates in the control of Ca(2+) release from the SR through phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor-coupling factor triadin (PubMed:16690701). In the central nervous system, it is involved in the regulation of neurite formation and arborization (PubMed:30184290). It may participate in the promotion of dendritic spine and synapse formation and maintenance of synaptic plasticity which enables long-term potentiation (LTP) and hippocampus-dependent learning. In response to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) stimulation, catalyzes phosphorylation of STAT1, stimulating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane
