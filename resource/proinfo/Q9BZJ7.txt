UniprotID	Q9BZJ7
Accession	Q9BZJ7;F1DAM4;Q5KU27
EntryName	GPR62_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 62 (G-protein coupled receptor GPCR8) (hGPCR8) (G-protein coupled receptor KPG_005)
GeneName	GPR62
Length	368
Function	Orphan G-protein coupled receptor. Constitutively activates the G(q/11)/inositol phosphate and the G(s)-alpha/cAMP signaling pathways (PubMed:28827538). Has spontaneous activity for beta-arrestin recruitment (PubMed:28827538). Shows a reciprocal modulation of signaling functions with the melatonin receptor MTNR1B most likely through receptor heteromerization (PubMed:28827538).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Endosome membrane
