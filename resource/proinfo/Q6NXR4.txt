UniprotID	Q6NXR4
Accession	Q6NXR4;D3DSV7;Q96IM2;Q9H5N4
EntryName	TTI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	TELO2-interacting protein 2
GeneName	TTI2 C8orf41
Length	508
Function	Regulator of the DNA damage response (DDR). Part of the TTT complex that is required to stabilize protein levels of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase (PIKK) family proteins. The TTT complex is involved in the cellular resistance to DNA damage stresses, like ionizing radiation (IR), ultraviolet (UV) and mitomycin C (MMC). Together with the TTT complex and HSP90 may participate in the proper folding of newly synthesized PIKKs.
