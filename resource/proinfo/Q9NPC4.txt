UniprotID	Q9NPC4
Accession	Q9NPC4;B2R7C4;Q9P1X5
EntryName	A4GAT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lactosylceramide 4-alpha-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.228) (Alpha-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase) (Alpha-1,4-galactosyltransferase) (Alpha4Gal-T1) (CD77 synthase) (Globotriaosylceramide synthase) (Gb3 synthase) (P1/Pk synthase) (UDP-galactose:beta-D-galactosyl-beta1-R 4-alpha-D-galactosyltransferase)
GeneName	A4GALT A14GALT A4GALT1
Length	353
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-alpha-D-galactose to lactosylceramide/beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1<->1)-ceramide(d18:1(4E)) to produce globotriaosylceramide/globoside Gb3Cer (d18:1(4E)) (PubMed:10748143). Also able to transfer galactose to galactosylceramide/beta-D-Gal-(1<->1')-Cer (PubMed:10748143). Globoside Gb3Cer is a glycosphingolipid of the globo serie, one of the major types of neutral root structures of glycosphingolipids, that constitute a significant portion of mammalian cell membranes (Probable). Globotriaosylceramide/globoside Gb3Cer in blood and tissue cell membranes is the antigen Pk of blood histogroup P (PubMed:10747952).
