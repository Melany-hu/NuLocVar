UniprotID	Q9GZY4
Accession	Q9GZY4;A6NJU8;A8KAH8;Q9HAB7;Q9NVD2
EntryName	COA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 1 homolog (Mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase protein of 15 kDa)
GeneName	COA1 C7orf44 MITRAC15
Length	146
Function	Component of the MITRAC (mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase complex) complex, that regulates cytochrome c oxidase assembly. MITRAC complexes regulate both translation of mitochondrial encoded components and assembly of nuclear-encoded components imported in mitochondrion. Required for assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and complex IV (PubMed:23260140). As part of the MCIA complex, required for efficient assembly of the mitochondrial complex I (PubMed:32320651).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
