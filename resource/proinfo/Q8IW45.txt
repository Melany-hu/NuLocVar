UniprotID	Q8IW45
Accession	Q8IW45;B4DXT4;Q5T9X3;Q9H7W1;Q9NVF5
EntryName	NNRD_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP-dependent (S)-NAD(P)H-hydrate dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.93) (ATP-dependent NAD(P)HX dehydratase) (Carbohydrate kinase domain-containing protein) (NAD(P)HX dehydratase)
GeneName	NAXD CARKD
Length	347
Function	Catalyzes the dehydration of the S-form of NAD(P)HX at the expense of ATP, which is converted to ADP. Together with NAD(P)HX epimerase, which catalyzes the epimerization of the S- and R-forms, the enzyme allows the repair of both epimers of NAD(P)HX, a damaged form of NAD(P)H that is a result of enzymatic or heat-dependent hydration.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
