EntryName	PARVA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-parvin (Actopaxin) (CH-ILKBP) (Calponin-like integrin-linked kinase-binding protein) (Matrix-remodeling-associated protein 2)
GeneName	PARVA MXRA2
Length	372
Function	Plays a role in sarcomere organization and in smooth muscle cell contraction. Required for normal development of the embryonic cardiovascular system, and for normal septation of the heart outflow tract. Plays a role in sprouting angiogenesis and is required for normal adhesion of vascular smooth muscle cells to endothelial cells during blood vessel development (By similarity). Plays a role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, formation of lamellipodia and ciliogenesis. Plays a role in the establishment of cell polarity, cell adhesion, cell spreading, and directed cell migration. Within the IPP (ILK-PINCH-PARVIN) complex, binds to F-actin, promoting F-actin bundling, a process required to generate force for actin cytoskeleton reorganization and subsequent dynamic cell adhesion events such as cell spreading and migration (PubMed:30367047).
