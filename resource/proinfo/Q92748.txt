UniprotID	Q92748
Accession	Q92748;B2R4W7
EntryName	THRSP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thyroid hormone-inducible hepatic protein (Spot 14 protein) (S14) (SPOT14)
GeneName	THRSP
Length	146
Function	Plays a role in the regulation of lipogenesis, especially in lactating mammary gland. Important for the biosynthesis of triglycerides with medium-length fatty acid chains. May modulate lipogenesis by interacting with MID1IP1 and preventing its interaction with ACACA (By similarity). May function as transcriptional coactivator. May modulate the transcription factor activity of THRB.
