EntryName	TLR6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Toll-like receptor 6 (CD antigen CD286)
GeneName	TLR6
Length	796
Function	Participates in the innate immune response to Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. Specifically recognizes diacylated and, to a lesser extent, triacylated lipopeptides (PubMed:20037584). In response to diacylated lipopeptides, forms the activation cluster TLR2:TLR6:CD14:CD36, this cluster triggers signaling from the cell surface and subsequently is targeted to the Golgi in a lipid-raft dependent pathway (PubMed:16880211). Acts via MYD88 and TRAF6, leading to NF-kappa-B activation, cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response. Recognizes mycoplasmal macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2kD (MALP-2), soluble tuberculosis factor (STF), phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) and B.burgdorferi outer surface protein A lipoprotein (OspA-L) cooperatively with TLR2 (PubMed:11441107). In complex with TLR4, promotes sterile inflammation in monocytes/macrophages in response to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) or amyloid-beta 42. In this context, the initial signal is provided by oxLDL- or amyloid-beta 42-binding to CD36. This event induces the formation of a heterodimer of TLR4 and TLR6, which is rapidly internalized and triggers inflammatory response, leading to the NF-kappa-B-dependent production of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL9 cytokines, via MYD88 signaling pathway, and CCL5 cytokine, via TICAM1 signaling pathway, as well as IL1B secretion (PubMed:11441107, PubMed:20037584).
