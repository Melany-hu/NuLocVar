UniprotID	Q96M29
Accession	Q96M29;A1L3Z3
EntryName	TEKT5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tektin-5
GeneName	TEKT5
Length	485
Function	Sperm-specific microtubule inner protein (MIP) part of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in flagellar axoneme. Forms an extensive interaction network in different conformations that reinforces the helix bundle composed by other tektin proteins (TEKT1 to TEKT4) and MIPs to anchor the tektin bundle onto the tubulin wall of A-tubule of the sperm flagellum.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Flagellum axoneme
