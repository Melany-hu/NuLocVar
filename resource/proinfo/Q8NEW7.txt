UniprotID	Q8NEW7
Accession	Q8NEW7;A0AV93;A8K0R0
EntryName	TMIE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane inner ear expressed protein
GeneName	TMIE
Length	156
Function	Auxiliary subunit of the mechanotransducer (MET) non-specific cation channel complex located at the tips of stereocilia of cochlear hair cells and that mediates sensory transduction in the auditory system. The MET complex is composed of two dimeric pore-forming ion-conducting transmembrane TMC (TMC1 or TMC2) subunits, and aided by several auxiliary proteins including LHFPL5, TMIE, CIB2/3 and TOMT, and the tip-link PCDH15. May contribute to the formation of the pore.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
