UniprotID	Q9BYP8
Accession	Q9BYP8
EntryName	KR171_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 17-1 (Keratin-associated protein 16.1)
GeneName	KRTAP17-1 KAP17.1 KRTAP16.1
Length	105
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
