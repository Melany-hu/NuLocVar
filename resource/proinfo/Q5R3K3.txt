UniprotID	Q5R3K3
Accession	Q5R3K3;B9EJB0;Q5R3K4
EntryName	CAHM6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium homeostasis modulator protein 6 (Protein FAM26F)
GeneName	CALHM6 C6orf187 FAM26F
Length	315
Function	Pore-forming subunit of an ATP-permeable channel (By similarity). In response to pathogen-derived and proinflammatory stimuli, relocates from intracellular compartments to NK-dendritic cell and NK-macrophage immune synapses where it mediates ATP efflux and NK cell activation involved in antimicrobial and antitumor responses (By similarity). May assemble to form gap junction channel-like structures with gating and ion conductance likely regulated by membrane lipids and voltage rather than by extracellular calcium levels (PubMed:32374262).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
