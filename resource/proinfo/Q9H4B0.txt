UniprotID	Q9H4B0
Accession	Q9H4B0;Q96EV9;Q96NH5
EntryName	OSGL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA N6-adenosine threonylcarbamoyltransferase, mitochondrial (EC 2.3.1.234) (N6-L-threonylcarbamoyladenine synthase) (t(6)A synthase) (O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase-like protein 1) (OSGEP-like protein 1) (t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine biosynthesis protein OSGEPL1) (tRNA threonylcarbamoyladenosine biosynthesis protein OSGEPL1)
GeneName	OSGEPL1 GCP1
Length	414
Function	Required for the formation of a threonylcarbamoyl group on adenosine at position 37 (t(6)A37) in mitochondrial tRNAs that read codons beginning with adenine. Probably involved in the transfer of the threonylcarbamoyl moiety of threonylcarbamoyl-AMP (TC-AMP) to the N6 group of A37. Involved in mitochondrial genome maintenance.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
