Accession	O43315;Q9NP32
EntryName	AQP9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aquaporin-9 (AQP-9) (Aquaglyceroporin-9) (Small solute channel 1)
GeneName	AQP9 SSC1
Length	295
Function	Aquaglyceroporins form homotetrameric transmembrane channels, with each monomer independently mediating glycerol and water transport across the plasma membrane along their osmotic gradient (PubMed:10564231, PubMed:30420639, PubMed:35054513, PubMed:9514918). AQP9 is the primary route for glycerol uptake in hepatocytes, supporting hepatic gluconeogenesis (By similarity). It exhibits broad specificity and may transport various small, non-charged solutes, including carbamides, polyols, purines, and pyrimidines (PubMed:10564231). AQP9 may also facilitate hepatic urea extrusion (PubMed:10564231, PubMed:9514918). Due to its permeability to lactate, AQP9 might participate in the astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttle, supplying neurons with energy (PubMed:10564231, PubMed:35054513). Additionally, AQP9 is permeable to arsenite, contributing to arsenic excretion by the liver and providing partial protection against arsenic toxicity (PubMed:10564231). It is also permeable to H2O2 in vivo (PubMed:26837049). Could also be permeable to ammonium (By similarity).
