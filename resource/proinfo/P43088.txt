UniprotID	P43088
Accession	P43088;A8K9Y0;Q2KHP3;Q6RYQ6;Q9P1X4
EntryName	PF2R_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostaglandin F2-alpha receptor (PGF receptor) (PGF2-alpha receptor) (Prostanoid FP receptor)
GeneName	PTGFR
Length	359
Function	Receptor for prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2-alpha). The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Initiates luteolysis in the corpus luteum (By similarity). Isoforms 2 to 7 do not bind PGF2-alpha but are proposed to modulate signaling by participating in variant receptor complexes; heterodimers between isoform 1 and isoform 5 are proposed to be a receptor for prostamides including the synthetic analog bimatoprost.
