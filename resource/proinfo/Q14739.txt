UniprotID	Q14739
Accession	Q14739;B2R5P3;Q14740;Q53GU7;Q59FE6
EntryName	LBR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Delta(14)-sterol reductase LBR (Delta-14-SR) (EC 1.3.1.70) (3-beta-hydroxysterol Delta (14)-reductase) (C-14 sterol reductase) (C14SR) (Integral nuclear envelope inner membrane protein) (LMN2R) (Lamin-B receptor) (Sterol C14-reductase)
GeneName	LBR
Length	615
Function	Catalyzes the reduction of the C14-unsaturated bond of lanosterol, as part of the metabolic pathway leading to cholesterol biosynthesis (PubMed:12618959, PubMed:16784888, PubMed:21327084, PubMed:27336722, PubMed:9630650). Plays a critical role in myeloid cell cholesterol biosynthesis which is essential to both myeloid cell growth and functional maturation (By similarity). Mediates the activation of NADPH oxidases, perhaps by maintaining critical levels of cholesterol required for membrane lipid raft formation during neutrophil differentiation (By similarity). Anchors the lamina and the heterochromatin to the inner nuclear membrane (PubMed:10828963).
