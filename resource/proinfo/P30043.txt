EntryName	BLVRB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Flavin reductase (NADPH) (FR) (EC 1.5.1.30) (Biliverdin reductase B) (BVR-B) (EC 1.3.1.-) (Biliverdin-IX beta-reductase) (Green heme-binding protein) (GHBP) (NADPH-dependent diaphorase) (NADPH-flavin reductase) (FLR) (S-nitroso-CoA-assisted nitrosyltransferase) (SNO-CoA-assisted nitrosyltransferase) (EC 2.6.99.-)
GeneName	BLVRB FLR SCAN
Length	206
Function	Enzyme that can both act as a NAD(P)H-dependent reductase and a S-nitroso-CoA-dependent nitrosyltransferase (PubMed:10620517, PubMed:18241201, PubMed:27207795, PubMed:38056462, PubMed:7929092). Promotes fetal heme degradation during development (PubMed:10858451, PubMed:18241201, PubMed:7929092). Also expressed in adult tissues, where it acts as a regulator of hematopoiesis, intermediary metabolism (glutaminolysis, glycolysis, TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathway) and insulin signaling (PubMed:27207795, PubMed:29500232, PubMed:38056462). Has a broad specificity oxidoreductase activity by catalyzing the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of a variety of flavins, such as riboflavin, FAD or FMN, biliverdins, methemoglobin and PQQ (pyrroloquinoline quinone) (PubMed:10620517, PubMed:18241201, PubMed:7929092). Contributes to fetal heme catabolism by catalyzing reduction of biliverdin IXbeta into bilirubin IXbeta in the liver (PubMed:10858451, PubMed:18241201, PubMed:7929092). Biliverdin IXbeta, which constitutes the major heme catabolite in the fetus is not present in adult (PubMed:10858451, PubMed:18241201, PubMed:7929092). Does not reduce bilirubin IXalpha (PubMed:10858451, PubMed:18241201, PubMed:7929092). Can also reduce the complexed Fe(3+) iron to Fe(2+) in the presence of FMN and NADPH (PubMed:10620517). Acts as a protein nitrosyltransferase by catalyzing nitrosylation of cysteine residues of target proteins, such as HMOX2, INSR and IRS1 (PubMed:38056462). S-nitroso-CoA-dependent nitrosyltransferase activity is mediated via a 'ping-pong' mechanism: BLVRB first associates with both S-nitroso-CoA and protein substrate, nitric oxide group is then transferred from S-nitroso-CoA to Cys-109 and Cys-188 residues of BLVRB and from S-nitroso-BLVRB to the protein substrate (PubMed:38056462). Inhibits insulin signaling by mediating nitrosylation of INSR and IRS1, leading to their inhibition (PubMed:38056462).
