UniprotID	Q9HCQ7
Accession	Q9HCQ7;A4D164;Q7LE27;Q96PI9
EntryName	NPVF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pro-FMRFamide-related neuropeptide VF [Cleaved into: Neuropeptide NPSF; Neuropeptide RFRP-1; Neuropeptide RFRP-2; Neuropeptide NPVF (Neuropeptide RFRP-3)]
GeneName	NPVF C7orf9 RFRP
Length	196
Function	Efficiently inhibits forskolin-induced production of cAMP. Acts as a potent negative regulator of gonadotropin synthesis and secretion (PubMed:11025660, PubMed:20027225). Induces secretion of prolactin (By similarity).
