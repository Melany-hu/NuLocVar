EntryName	AK1BF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B15 (EC 1.1.1.-) (EC 1.1.1.300) (EC 1.1.1.54) (Estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase AKR1B15) (Farnesol dehydrogenase) (EC 1.1.1.216) (Testosterone 17beta-dehydrogenase) (EC 1.1.1.64)
GeneName	AKR1B15
Length	316
Function	Catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a variety of carbonyl substrates, like aromatic aldehydes, alkenals, ketones and alpha-dicarbonyl compounds (PubMed:21276782, PubMed:26222439). In addition, catalyzes the reduction of androgens and estrogens with high positional selectivity (shows 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity) as well as 3-keto-acyl-CoAs (PubMed:25577493). Displays strong enzymatic activity toward all-trans-retinal and 9-cis-retinal (PubMed:26222439). May play a physiological role in retinoid metabolism (PubMed:26222439).
