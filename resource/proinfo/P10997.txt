UniprotID	P10997
Accession	P10997;Q0ZD87;Q14598
EntryName	IAPP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) (Amylin) (Diabetes-associated peptide) (DAP) (Insulinoma amyloid peptide)
GeneName	IAPP
Length	89
Function	Amylin/IAPP is a glucoregulatory peptide hormone that plays an important role in the regulation of energy homeostasis (PubMed:2690069). Selectively inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose utilization and glycogen deposition in muscle, while not affecting adipocyte glucose metabolism. IAPP function is mediated by the CALCR-RAMPs (AMYRs) receptor complexes (By similarity). Amylin can also bind CALCR receptor in the absence of RAMPs, although it is more selective for AMYRs (By similarity).
