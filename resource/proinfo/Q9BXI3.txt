UniprotID	Q9BXI3
Accession	Q9BXI3;Q3SYB9;Q5TG98;Q9BWT8
EntryName	5NT1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A (cN1A) (EC 3.1.3.5) (EC 3.1.3.89) (EC 3.1.3.99) (5'-deoxynucleotidase) (Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase IA) (cN-I) (cN-IA)
GeneName	NT5C1A
Length	368
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolysis of ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide monophosphates, releasing inorganic phosphate and the corresponding nucleoside (PubMed:11133996, PubMed:34814800, PubMed:7599155, PubMed:8967393). AMP is the major substrate but can also hydrolyze dCMP and IMP (PubMed:11133996, PubMed:34814800, PubMed:7599155, PubMed:8967393).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
