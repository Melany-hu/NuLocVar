UniprotID	Q96IU4
Accession	Q96IU4;Q86VK8;Q8N8W5
EntryName	ABHEB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Putative protein-lysine deacylase ABHD14B (EC 2.3.1.-) (Alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 14B) (Abhydrolase domain-containing protein 14B) (CCG1-interacting factor B)
GeneName	ABHD14B CIB
Length	210
Function	Acts as an atypical protein-lysine deacetylase in vitro (PubMed:31478652). Catalyzes the deacetylation of lysine residues using CoA as substrate, generating acetyl-CoA and the free amine of protein-lysine residues (PubMed:31478652). Additional experiments are however required to confirm the protein-lysine deacetylase activity in vivo (Probable). Has hydrolase activity towards various surrogate p-nitrophenyl (pNp) substrates, such as pNp-butyrate, pNp-acetate and pNp-octanoate in vitro, with a strong preference for pNp-acetate (PubMed:14672934, PubMed:31478652). May activate transcription (PubMed:14672934).
