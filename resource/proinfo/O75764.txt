UniprotID	O75764
Accession	O75764;A8K2K7;Q5DR83
EntryName	TCEA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription elongation factor A protein 3 (Transcription elongation factor S-II protein 3) (Transcription elongation factor TFIIS.h)
GeneName	TCEA3 TFIISH
Length	348
Function	Necessary for efficient RNA polymerase II transcription elongation past template-encoded arresting sites. The arresting sites in DNA have the property of trapping a certain fraction of elongating RNA polymerases that pass through, resulting in locked ternary complexes. Cleavage of the nascent transcript by S-II allows the resumption of elongation from the new 3'-terminus.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
