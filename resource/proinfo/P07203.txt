UniprotID	P07203
Accession	P07203;E9PAS1;Q7Z5H1;Q9BW12
EntryName	GPX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx-1) (GSHPx-1) (EC 1.11.1.9) (Cellular glutathione peroxidase) (Phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase GPX1) (EC 1.11.1.12)
GeneName	GPX1
Length	203
Function	Catalyzes the reduction of hydroperoxides in a glutathione-dependent manner thus regulating cellular redox homeostasis (PubMed:11115402, PubMed:36608588). Can reduce small soluble hydroperoxides such as H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, as well as several fatty acid-derived hydroperoxides (PubMed:11115402, PubMed:36608588). In platelets catalyzes the reduction of 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, the primary product of the arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase pathway (PubMed:11115402).
