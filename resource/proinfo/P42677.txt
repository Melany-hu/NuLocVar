UniprotID	P42677
Accession	P42677;Q5T4L6
EntryName	RS27_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein eS27 (40S ribosomal protein S27) (Metallopan-stimulin 1) (MPS-1)
GeneName	RPS27 MPS1
Length	84
Function	Component of the small ribosomal subunit (PubMed:23636399, PubMed:8706699). The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:23636399). Required for proper rRNA processing and maturation of 18S rRNAs (PubMed:25424902). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
