UniprotID	Q96HC4
Accession	Q96HC4;A8K6F9;D6RB78;E9PBF5;O60705;Q56VN4;Q5UW38;Q8WVK0
EntryName	PDLI5_HUMAN
ProteinName	PDZ and LIM domain protein 5 (Enigma homolog) (Enigma-like PDZ and LIM domains protein)
GeneName	PDLIM5 ENH L9
Length	596
Function	May play an important role in the heart development by scaffolding PKC to the Z-disk region. May play a role in the regulation of cardiomyocyte expansion. Isoforms lacking the LIM domains may negatively modulate the scaffolding activity of isoform 1. Overexpression promotes the development of heart hypertrophy. Contributes to the regulation of dendritic spine morphogenesis in neurons. May be required to restrain postsynaptic growth of excitatory synapses. Isoform 1, but not isoform 2, expression favors spine thinning and elongation.
Subcellular Location	Postsynaptic density; Presynapse; Postsynapse; Cytoplasm; Cytosol
