UniprotID	P36955
Accession	P36955;F1T092;Q13236;Q2TU83;Q96CT1;Q96R01;Q9BWA4
EntryName	PEDF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) (Cell proliferation-inducing gene 35 protein) (EPC-1) (Serpin F1)
GeneName	SERPINF1 PEDF PIG35
Length	418
Function	Neurotrophic protein; induces extensive neuronal differentiation in retinoblastoma cells. Potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. As it does not undergo the S (stressed) to R (relaxed) conformational transition characteristic of active serpins, it exhibits no serine protease inhibitory activity.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Melanosome
