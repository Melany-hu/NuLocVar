UniprotID	Q9UHD1
Accession	Q9UHD1;B2R6P8;Q6IN49;Q8WVL9;Q9H3D6
EntryName	CHRD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cysteine and histidine-rich domain-containing protein 1 (CHORD domain-containing protein 1) (CHORD-containing protein 1) (CHP-1) (Protein morgana)
GeneName	CHORDC1 CHP1
Length	332
Function	Regulates centrosome duplication, probably by inhibiting the kinase activity of ROCK2 (PubMed:20230755). Proposed to act as co-chaperone for HSP90 (PubMed:20230755). May play a role in the regulation of NOD1 via a HSP90 chaperone complex (PubMed:20230755). In vitro, has intrinsic chaperone activity (PubMed:20230755). This function may be achieved by inhibiting association of ROCK2 with NPM1 (PubMed:20230755). Plays a role in ensuring the localization of the tyrosine kinase receptor EGFR to the plasma membrane, and thus ensures the subsequent regulation of EGFR activity and EGF-induced actin cytoskeleton remodeling (PubMed:32053105). Involved in stress response (PubMed:20230755). Prevents tumorigenesis (PubMed:20230755).
