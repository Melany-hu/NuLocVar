UniprotID	Q3LI76
Accession	Q3LI76;Q2M3F4
EntryName	KR151_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 15-1
GeneName	KRTAP15-1 KAP15.1
Length	137
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
