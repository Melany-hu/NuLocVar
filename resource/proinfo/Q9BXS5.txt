UniprotID	Q9BXS5
Accession	Q9BXS5;Q4TTY5
EntryName	AP1M1_HUMAN
ProteinName	AP-1 complex subunit mu-1 (AP-mu chain family member mu1A) (Adaptor protein complex AP-1 subunit mu-1) (Adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit mu-1) (Clathrin assembly protein complex 1 mu-1 medium chain 1) (Clathrin coat assembly protein AP47) (Clathrin coat-associated protein AP47) (Golgi adaptor HA1/AP1 adaptin mu-1 subunit) (Mu-adaptin 1) (Mu1A-adaptin)
GeneName	AP1M1 CLTNM
Length	423
Function	Subunit of clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1 that plays a role in protein sorting in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. The AP complexes mediate the recruitment of clathrin to membranes and the recognition of sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane
