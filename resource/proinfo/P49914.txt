UniprotID	P49914
Accession	P49914;H3BQ75
EntryName	MTHFS_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase (EC 6.3.3.2) (5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate synthetase) (MTHFS) (Methenyl-THF synthetase)
GeneName	MTHFS
Length	203
Function	Contributes to tetrahydrofolate metabolism. Helps regulate carbon flow through the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolic network that supplies carbon for the biosynthesis of purines, thymidine and amino acids. Catalyzes the irreversible conversion of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-FTHF) to yield 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
