UniprotID	P04201
Accession	P04201;E1P5B3;Q2TBC9;Q6FG47
EntryName	MAS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proto-oncogene Mas
GeneName	MAS1 MAS
Length	325
Function	Receptor for angiotensin 1-7 (By similarity). Acts specifically as a functional antagonist of AGTR1 (angiotensin-2 type 1 receptor), although it up-regulates AGTR1 receptor levels. Positive regulation of AGTR1 levels occurs through activation of the G-proteins GNA11 and GNAQ, and stimulation of the protein kinase C signaling cascade. The antagonist effect on AGTR1 function is probably due to AGTR1 being physically altered by MAS1.
