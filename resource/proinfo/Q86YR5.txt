UniprotID	Q86YR5
Accession	Q86YR5;A9Z1X4;B1B0W3;Q86SR5;Q969T1;Q9UFS8
EntryName	GPSM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein-signaling modulator 1 (Activator of G-protein signaling 3)
GeneName	GPSM1 AGS3
Length	675
Function	Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) which functions as a receptor-independent activator of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling. Keeps G(i/o) alpha subunit in its GDP-bound form thus uncoupling heterotrimeric G-proteins signaling from G protein-coupled receptors. Controls spindle orientation and asymmetric cell fate of cerebral cortical progenitors. May also be involved in macroautophagy in intestinal cells. May play a role in drug addiction.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Cell membrane
