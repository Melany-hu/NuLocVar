UniprotID	P48050
Accession	P48050;Q14D44
EntryName	KCNJ4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inward rectifier potassium channel 4 (HIRK2) (HRK1) (Hippocampal inward rectifier) (HIR) (Inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir2.3) (IRK-3) (Potassium channel, inwardly rectifying subfamily J member 4)
GeneName	KCNJ4 IRK3
Length	445
Function	Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium. Can be blocked by extracellular barium and cesium.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Postsynaptic cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane
