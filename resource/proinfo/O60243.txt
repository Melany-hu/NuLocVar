UniprotID	O60243
Accession	O60243;B4DEP2;B4DJ29;Q53SL2;Q9BVI1
EntryName	H6ST1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heparan-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS6ST-1) (EC 2.8.2.-)
GeneName	HS6ST1 HS6ST
Length	411
Function	6-O-sulfation enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to position 6 of the N-sulfoglucosamine residue (GlcNS) of heparan sulfate. Critical for normal neuronal development where it may play a role in neuron branching. May also play a role in limb development. May prefer iduronic acid.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
