UniprotID	Q9UI14
Accession	Q9UI14;Q7Z4Y2;Q9Y3R1
EntryName	PRAF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prenylated Rab acceptor protein 1 (PRA1 family protein 1)
GeneName	RABAC1 PRA1 PRAF1
Length	185
Function	General Rab protein regulator required for vesicle formation from the Golgi complex. May control vesicle docking and fusion by mediating the action of Rab GTPases to the SNARE complexes. In addition it inhibits the removal of Rab GTPases from the membrane by GDI.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Golgi apparatus; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle
