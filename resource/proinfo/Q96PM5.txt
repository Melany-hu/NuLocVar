EntryName	ZN363_HUMAN
ProteinName	RING finger and CHY zinc finger domain-containing protein 1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Androgen receptor N-terminal-interacting protein) (CH-rich-interacting match with PLAG1) (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Pirh2) (RING finger protein 199) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase RCHY1) (Zinc finger protein 363) (p53-induced RING-H2 protein) (hPirh2)
GeneName	RCHY1 ARNIP CHIMP PIRH2 RNF199 ZNF363
Length	261
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates ubiquitination of target proteins, including p53/TP53, TP73, HDAC1 and CDKN1B (PubMed:16914734, PubMed:17721809, PubMed:18006823, PubMed:19043414, PubMed:19483087, PubMed:21994467). Mediates ubiquitination and degradation of p53/TP53; preferentially acts on tetrameric p53/TP53 (PubMed:19043414, PubMed:19483087). Catalyzes monoubiquitinates the translesion DNA polymerase POLH (PubMed:21791603). Involved in the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway, which mediates the extraction of incompletely synthesized nascent chains from stalled ribosomes: RCHY1 acts downstream of NEMF and recognizes CAT tails associated with stalled nascent chains, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:33909987).
