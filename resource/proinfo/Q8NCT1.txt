UniprotID	Q8NCT1
Accession	Q8NCT1;Q6NSI9
EntryName	ARRD4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Arrestin domain-containing protein 4
GeneName	ARRDC4
Length	418
Function	Functions as an adapter recruiting ubiquitin-protein ligases to their specific substrates (By similarity). Plays a role in endocytosis of activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Probable). Through an ubiquitination-dependent mechanism also plays a role in the incorporation of SLC11A2 into extracellular vesicles (By similarity). May play a role in glucose uptake (PubMed:19605364). Participates in innate immune response by promoting IFIH1/MDA5 activation through interaction with TRIM65 (PubMed:28594402).
