UniprotID	Q8TEW6
Accession	Q8TEW6;O75209;Q9BTP2;Q9NVV3
EntryName	DOK4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Docking protein 4 (Downstream of tyrosine kinase 4) (Insulin receptor substrate 5) (IRS-5) (IRS5)
GeneName	DOK4
Length	326
Function	DOK proteins are enzymatically inert adaptor or scaffolding proteins. They provide a docking platform for the assembly of multimolecular signaling complexes. DOK4 functions in RET-mediated neurite outgrowth and plays a positive role in activation of the MAP kinase pathway (By similarity). Putative link with downstream effectors of RET in neuronal differentiation. May be involved in the regulation of the immune response induced by T-cells.
