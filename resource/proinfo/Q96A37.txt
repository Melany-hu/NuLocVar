EntryName	RN166_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF166 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 166) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase RNF166)
GeneName	RNF166
Length	237
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that promotes the ubiquitination of different substrates (PubMed:27880896). In turn, participates in different biological processes including interferon production or autophagy (PubMed:26456228, PubMed:27880896). Plays a role in the activation of RNA virus-induced interferon-beta production by promoting the ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 (PubMed:26456228). Also plays a role in the early recruitment of autophagy adapters to bacteria (PubMed:27880896). Mediates 'Lys-29' and 'Lys-33'-linked ubiquitination of SQSTM1 leading to xenophagic targeting of bacteria and inhibition of their replication (PubMed:27880896).
