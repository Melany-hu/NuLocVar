UniprotID	Q96PU9
Accession	Q96PU9;B7ZLT0;Q69YX0
EntryName	CMA1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ciliary microtubule associated protein 1A (Outer dense fiber of sperm tails protein 3) (Outer dense fiber protein 3) (Sperm tail protein SHIPPO 1) (Transcript induced in spermiogenesis protein 50)
GeneName	CIMAP1A ODF3 SHIPPO1 TISP50
Length	254
Function	Outer dense fibers are filamentous structures located on the outside of the axoneme in the midpiece and principal piece of the mammalian sperm tail. May help to maintain the passive elastic structures and elastic recoil of the sperm tail.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Flagellum axoneme
