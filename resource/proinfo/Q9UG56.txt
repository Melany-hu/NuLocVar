EntryName	PISD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase proenzyme, mitochondrial (EC 4.1.1.65) [Cleaved into: Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase beta chain; Phosphatidylserine decarboxylase alpha chain]
GeneName	PISD
Length	409
Function	Catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) (PubMed:30488656, PubMed:30858161). Plays a central role in phospholipid metabolism and in the interorganelle trafficking of phosphatidylserine. May be involved in lipid droplet biogenesis at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Mitochondrion inner membrane; Cytoplasm; Mitochondrion inner membrane; Mitochondrion inner membrane; Lipid droplet
