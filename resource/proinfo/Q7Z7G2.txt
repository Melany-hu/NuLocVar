UniprotID	Q7Z7G2
Accession	Q7Z7G2;F1T0L6
EntryName	CPLX4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complexin-4 (Complexin IV) (CPX IV)
GeneName	CPLX4
Length	160
Function	Complexin that regulates SNARE protein complex-mediated synaptic vesicle fusion (By similarity). Required for the maintenance of synaptic ultrastructure in the adult retina (By similarity). Positively regulates synaptic transmission through synaptic vesicle availability and exocytosis of neurotransmitters at photoreceptor ribbon synapses in the retina (By similarity). Suppresses tonic photoreceptor activity and baseline 'noise' by suppression of Ca(2+) vesicle tonic release and the facilitation of evoked synchronous and asynchronous Ca(2+) vesicle release (By similarity).
