UniprotID	Q9NYH9
Accession	Q9NYH9;Q8IX96;Q96BL2;Q9NQ91
EntryName	UTP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 6 homolog (Hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 66) (Multiple hat domains protein)
GeneName	UTP6 C17orf40 HCA66 MHAT
Length	597
Function	Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome. Involved in nucleolar processing of pre-18S ribosomal RNA.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleolus
