EntryName	APTX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aprataxin (EC 3.6.1.71) (EC 3.6.1.72) (Forkhead-associated domain histidine triad-like protein) (FHA-HIT)
GeneName	APTX AXA1
Length	356
Function	DNA-binding protein involved in single-strand DNA break repair, double-strand DNA break repair and base excision repair (PubMed:15044383, PubMed:15380105, PubMed:16964241, PubMed:17276982, PubMed:24362567). Resolves abortive DNA ligation intermediates formed either at base excision sites, or when DNA ligases attempt to repair non-ligatable breaks induced by reactive oxygen species (PubMed:16964241, PubMed:24362567). Catalyzes the release of adenylate groups covalently linked to 5'-phosphate termini, resulting in the production of 5'-phosphate termini that can be efficiently rejoined (PubMed:16964241, PubMed:17276982, PubMed:24362567). Also able to hydrolyze adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidate (AMP-NH(2)) and diadenosine tetraphosphate (AppppA), but with lower catalytic activity (PubMed:16547001). Likewise, catalyzes the release of 3'-linked guanosine (DNAppG) and inosine (DNAppI) from DNA, but has higher specific activity with 5'-linked adenosine (AppDNA) (By similarity).
