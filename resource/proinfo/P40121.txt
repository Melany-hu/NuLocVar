UniprotID	P40121
Accession	P40121;B8ZZS7;D6W5K8;Q53SA7
EntryName	CAPG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Macrophage-capping protein (Actin regulatory protein CAP-G)
GeneName	CAPG AFCP MCP
Length	348
Function	Calcium-sensitive protein which reversibly blocks the barbed ends of actin filaments but does not sever preformed actin filaments. May play an important role in macrophage function. May play a role in regulating cytoplasmic and/or nuclear structures through potential interactions with actin. May bind DNA.
