UniprotID	Q96A05
Accession	Q96A05
EntryName	VATE2_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit E 2 (V-ATPase subunit E 2) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit E 2)
GeneName	ATP6V1E2 ATP6E1 ATP6EL2 ATP6V1EL2
Length	226
Function	Subunit of the V1 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons. V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment.
