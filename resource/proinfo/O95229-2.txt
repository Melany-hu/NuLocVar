EntryName	ZWINT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Outer kinetochore KNL1 complex subunit ZWINT (ZW10 interactor) (ZW10-interacting protein 1) (Zwint-1)
GeneName	ZWINT
Length	230
Function	Acts as a component of the outer kinetochore KNL1 complex that serves as a docking point for spindle assembly checkpoint components and mediates microtubule-kinetochore interactions (PubMed:15094189, PubMed:15485811, PubMed:15824131, PubMed:16732327, PubMed:24530301, PubMed:27881301, PubMed:38459127, PubMed:38459128). Kinetochores, consisting of a centromere-associated inner segment and a microtubule-contacting outer segment, play a crucial role in chromosome segregation by mediating the physical connection between centromeric DNA and spindle microtubules (PubMed:15094189, PubMed:15485811, PubMed:16732327). The outer kinetochore is made up of the ten-subunit KMN network, comprising the MIS12, NDC80 and KNL1 complexes, and auxiliary microtubule-associated components; together they connect the outer kinetochore with the inner kinetochore, bind microtubules, and mediate interactions with mitotic checkpoint proteins that delay anaphase until chromosomes are bioriented on the spindle (PubMed:15094189, PubMed:15485811, PubMed:15824131, PubMed:16732327, PubMed:24530301, PubMed:38459127, PubMed:38459128). Targets the RZZ complex to the kinetochore at prometaphase (PubMed:15485811). Recruits MAD2L1 to the kinetochore, but is not required for BUB1B localization (By similarity). In addition to orienting mitotic chromosomes, it is also essential for alignment of homologous chromosomes during meiotic metaphase I (By similarity). In meiosis I, required to activate the spindle assembly checkpoint at unattached kinetochores to correct erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments (PubMed:15485811).
