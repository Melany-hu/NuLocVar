Accession	P30049;D6W5Y3;Q6FG90
EntryName	ATPD_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP synthase F(1) complex subunit delta, mitochondrial (ATP synthase F1 subunit delta) (F-ATPase delta subunit)
GeneName	ATP5F1D ATP5D
Length	168
Function	Subunit delta, of the mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase complex (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) that produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain (Probable) (PubMed:37244256). ATP synthase complex consist of a soluble F(1) head domain - the catalytic core - and a membrane F(1) domain - the membrane proton channel (PubMed:37244256). These two domains are linked by a central stalk rotating inside the F(1) region and a stationary peripheral stalk (PubMed:37244256). During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation (Probable). In vivo, can only synthesize ATP although its ATP hydrolase activity can be activated artificially in vitro (By similarity). With the central stalk subunit gamma, is essential for the biogenesis of F(1) catalytic part of the ATP synthase complex namely in the formation of F1 assembly intermediate (PubMed:29499186).
