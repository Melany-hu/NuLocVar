UniprotID	O94760
Accession	O94760;Q5HYC8;Q86XK5
EntryName	DDAH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	N(G),N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH-1) (Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1) (EC 3.5.3.18) (DDAHI) (Dimethylargininase-1)
GeneName	DDAH1 DDAH
Length	285
Function	Hydrolyzes N(G),N(G)-dimethyl-L-arginine (ADMA) and N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (MMA) which act as inhibitors of NOS. Has therefore a role in the regulation of nitric oxide generation.
