UniprotID	A6NNS2-2
Accession	A6NNS2;B7ZW74;B9EJH3
EntryName	DRS7C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 7C (EC 1.1.1.105) (Sarcoplasmic reticulum protein of 35 kDa) (Protein SRP-35) (Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 32C member 2) (Protein SDR32C2)
GeneName	DHRS7C SDR32C2
Length	311
Function	NADH-dependent oxidoreductase which catalyzes the oxidation of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinal. Plays a role in the regulation of cardiac and skeletal muscle metabolic functions. Maintains Ca(2+) intracellular homeostasis by repressing Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in myotubes, possibly through local alternations in NAD/NADH or retinol/retinal. Also plays a role in Ca(2+) homeostasis by controlling Ca(2+) overload in the cytosol and the SR in myotubes. Involved in glucose uptake into skeletal muscles and muscle performance by activating PI3K and mTORC2-mediated AKT1 phosphorylation signaling pathways, possibly through the action of its downstream catalytic product all-trans-retinoic acid.
