UniprotID	O43639
Accession	O43639;D3DVK1;Q9BWN9;Q9UIC3
EntryName	NCK2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytoplasmic protein NCK2 (Growth factor receptor-bound protein 4) (NCK adaptor protein 2) (Nck-2) (SH2/SH3 adaptor protein NCK-beta)
GeneName	NCK2 GRB4
Length	380
Function	Adapter protein which associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors or their cellular substrates. Maintains low levels of EIF2S1 phosphorylation by promoting its dephosphorylation by PP1. Plays a role in ELK1-dependent transcriptional activation in response to activated Ras signaling.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Endoplasmic reticulum
