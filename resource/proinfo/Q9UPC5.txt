UniprotID	Q9UPC5
Accession	Q9UPC5;O95853
EntryName	GPR34_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable G-protein coupled receptor 34
GeneName	GPR34
Length	381
Function	G-protein-coupled receptor of lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS) that plays different roles in immune response (PubMed:16460680). Acts a damage-sensing receptor that triggers tissue repair upon recognition of dying neutrophils (By similarity). Mechanistically, apoptotic neutrophils release lysophosphatydilserine that are recognized by type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) via GPR34, which activates downstream PI3K-AKT and RAS-ERK signaling pathways leading to STAT3 activation and IL-22 production (By similarity). Plays an important role in microglial function, controlling morphology and phagocytosis (By similarity).
