EntryName	MCIN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Multicilin (Multiciliate differentiation and DNA synthesis-associated cell cycle protein) (McIdas protein) (Protein Idas)
GeneName	MCIDAS IDAS MCI MCIN
Length	385
Function	Transcription regulator specifically required for multiciliate cell differentiation (PubMed:25048963). Acts in a multiprotein complex containing E2F4 and E2F5 that binds and activates genes required for centriole biogenesis. Required for the deuterosome-mediated acentriolar pathway (PubMed:25048963). Plays a role in mitotic cell cycle progression by promoting cell cycle exit. Modulates GMNN activity by reducing its affinity for CDT1 (PubMed:21543332, PubMed:24064211).
