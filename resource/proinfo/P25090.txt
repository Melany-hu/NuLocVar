UniprotID	P25090
Accession	P25090;A8K3E2
EntryName	FPR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-formyl peptide receptor 2 (FMLP-related receptor I) (FMLP-R-I) (Formyl peptide receptor-like 1) (HM63) (Lipoxin A4 receptor) (LXA4 receptor) (RFP)
GeneName	FPR2 FPRH1 FPRL1 LXA4R
Length	351
Function	Low affinity receptor for N-formyl-methionyl peptides, which are powerful neutrophil chemotactic factors (PubMed:1374236). Binding of FMLP to the receptor causes activation of neutrophils (PubMed:1374236). This response is mediated via a G-protein that activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system (PubMed:1374236). The activation of LXA4R could result in an anti-inflammatory outcome counteracting the actions of pro-inflammatory signals such as LTB4 (leukotriene B4) (PubMed:9547339). Receptor for the chemokine-like protein FAM19A5, mediating FAM19A5-stimulated macrophage chemotaxis and the inhibitory effect on TNFSF11/RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation (By similarity). Acts as a receptor for humanin (PubMed:15465011).
