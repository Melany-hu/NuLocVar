UniprotID	P18065
Accession	P18065;Q14619;Q9UCL3
EntryName	IBP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IBP-2) (IGF-binding protein 2) (IGFBP-2)
GeneName	IGFBP2 BP2 IBP2
Length	325
Function	Multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in regulating the availability of IGFs such as IGF1 and IGF2 to their receptors and thereby regulates IGF-mediated cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in a cell-type specific manner (PubMed:18563800, PubMed:38796567). Functions coordinately with receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/PTPRB and the IGF1 receptor to regulate IGF1-mediated signaling by stimulating the phosphorylation of PTEN leading to its inactivation and AKT1 activation (PubMed:22869525). Plays a positive role in cell migration via interaction with integrin alpha5/ITGA5 through an RGD motif (PubMed:16569642). Additionally, interaction with ITGA5/ITGB1 enhances the adhesion of endothelial progenitor cells to endothelial cells (PubMed:26076738). Upon mitochondrial damage, facilitates apoptosis with ITGA5 of podocytes, and then activates the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-mediated mitochondrial injury (PubMed:38796567).
