Function	Acts as a positive regulator of ciliary hedgehog signaling (By similarity). Probable regulator of ciliogenesis involved in limb morphogenesis (PubMed:27528616, PubMed:30395363). In cooperation with CBY1 it is involved in the recruitment and fusion of endosomal vesicles at distal appendages during early stages of ciliogenesis (PubMed:27528616, PubMed:30395363). Plays an important role in the mitochondrial function and is essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and inner membrane ultrastructure (PubMed:30404948). In vitro, can generate membrane curvature through preferential interaction with negatively charged phospholipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and cardiolipin and hence orchestrate cristae shape (PubMed:30404948).
