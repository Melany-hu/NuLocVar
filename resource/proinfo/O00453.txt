Accession	O00453;B0S8E0;B0S8E1;B0S8E5;O00452;O00454;Q13669;Q2HNT3;Q5HYS9;Q5SP24;Q5STA5;Q5STA6;Q5STA7;Q5STA8;Q5STW6;Q9UJR5;Q9UJR6;Q9UJR7;Q9UJR8;Q9UJS1
EntryName	LST1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leukocyte-specific transcript 1 protein (Protein B144)
GeneName	LST1 B144
Length	97
Function	Possible role in modulating immune responses. Induces morphological changes including production of filopodia and microspikes when overexpressed in a variety of cell types and may be involved in dendritic cell maturation. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 have an inhibitory effect on lymphocyte proliferation.
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Endomembrane system
