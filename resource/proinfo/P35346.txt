UniprotID	P35346
Accession	P35346;P34988;Q541E0;Q9UJI5
EntryName	SSR5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Somatostatin receptor type 5 (SS-5-R) (SS5-R) (SS5R) (SST5)
GeneName	SSTR5
Length	364
Function	Receptor for somatostatin 28 and to a lesser extent for somatostatin-14. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Increases cell growth inhibition activity of SSTR2 following heterodimerization.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
