UniprotID	Q969N4
Accession	Q969N4;Q5VUQ0
EntryName	TAAR8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trace amine-associated receptor 8 (TaR-8) (Trace amine receptor 8) (G-protein coupled receptor 102) (Trace amine receptor 5) (TaR-5)
GeneName	TAAR8 GPR102 TA5 TAR5 TRAR5
Length	342
Function	Olfactory receptor specific for trace amines (By similarity). Trace amine compounds are enriched in animal body fluids and act on trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) to elicit both intraspecific and interspecific innate behaviors (By similarity). Ligand-binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via G alpha proteins, possibly G(i)/G(o) G alpha proteins (PubMed:25391046).
