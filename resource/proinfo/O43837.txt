EntryName	IDH3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Isocitrate dehydrogenase [NAD] subunit beta, mitochondrial (Isocitric dehydrogenase subunit beta) (NAD(+)-specific ICDH subunit beta)
GeneName	IDH3B
Length	385
Function	Plays a structural role to facilitate the assembly and ensure the full activity of the enzyme catalyzing the decarboxylation of isocitrate (ICT) into alpha-ketoglutarate. The heterodimer composed of the alpha (IDH3A) and beta (IDH3B) subunits and the heterodimer composed of the alpha (IDH3A) and gamma (IDH3G) subunits, have considerable basal activity but the full activity of the heterotetramer (containing two subunits of IDH3A, one of IDH3B and one of IDH3G) requires the assembly and cooperative function of both heterodimers.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
