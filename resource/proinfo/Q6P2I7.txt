UniprotID	Q6P2I7
Accession	Q6P2I7;Q8WWH3;Q9NW89
EntryName	EBLN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endogenous Bornavirus-like nucleoprotein 2 (Endogenous Borna-like N element-2) (EBLN-2)
GeneName	EBLN2 GK006
Length	272
Function	May act as an RNA-binding protein. The C-terminal region is highly homologous to the bornavirus nucleocapsid N protein that binds viral RNA and oligomerizes. The viral protein also possesses a nuclear import and a nuclear export signal. These 2 signals seem absent in EBLN-2 supporting an unrelated function in Human.
