UniprotID	P60372
Accession	P60372;Q08AS0
EntryName	KR104_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 10-4 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.4) (Keratin-associated protein 10.4) (Keratin-associated protein 18-4) (Keratin-associated protein 18.4)
GeneName	KRTAP10-4 KAP10.4 KAP18-4 KRTAP10.4 KRTAP18-4 KRTAP18.4
Length	401
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
