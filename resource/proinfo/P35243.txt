UniprotID	P35243
Accession	P35243;Q53XL0
EntryName	RECO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Recoverin (Cancer-associated retinopathy protein) (Protein CAR)
GeneName	RCVRN RCV1
Length	200
Function	Acts as a calcium sensor and regulates phototransduction of cone and rod photoreceptor cells (By similarity). Modulates light sensitivity of cone photoreceptor in dark and dim conditions (By similarity). In response to high Ca(2+) levels induced by low light levels, prolongs RHO/rhodopsin activation in rod photoreceptor cells by binding to and inhibiting GRK1-mediated phosphorylation of RHO/rhodopsin (By similarity). Plays a role in scotopic vision/enhances vision in dim light by enhancing signal transfer between rod photoreceptors and rod bipolar cells (By similarity). Improves rod photoreceptor sensitivity in dim light and mediates response of rod photoreceptors to facilitate detection of change and motion in bright light (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Photoreceptor inner segment; Cell projection; Cilium; Photoreceptor outer segment; Photoreceptor outer segment membrane; Perikaryon
