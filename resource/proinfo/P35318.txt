EntryName	ADML_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pro-adrenomedullin [Cleaved into: Adrenomedullin (AM); Proadrenomedullin N-20 terminal peptide (ProAM N-terminal 20 peptide) (PAMP) (ProAM-N20)]
GeneName	ADM AM
Length	185
Function	Adrenomedullin/ADM and proadrenomedullin N-20 terminal peptide/PAMP are peptide hormones that act as potent hypotensive and vasodilatator agents (PubMed:8387282, PubMed:9620797). Numerous actions have been reported most related to the physiologic control of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. In the kidney, ADM is diuretic and natriuretic, and both ADM and PAMP inhibit aldosterone secretion by direct adrenal actions. In pituitary gland, both peptides at physiologically relevant doses inhibit basal ACTH secretion. Both peptides appear to act in brain and pituitary gland to facilitate the loss of plasma volume, actions which complement their hypotensive effects in blood vessels.
