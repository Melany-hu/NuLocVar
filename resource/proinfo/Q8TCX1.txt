EntryName	DC2L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytoplasmic dynein 2 light intermediate chain 1 (Dynein 2 light intermediate chain)
GeneName	DYNC2LI1 D2LIC LIC3 CGI-60
Length	351
Function	Acts as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 2 complex (dynein-2 complex), a motor protein complex that drives the movement of cargos along microtubules within cilia and flagella in concert with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, facilitating the assembly of these organelles (PubMed:29742051). Involved in the regulation of ciliary length (PubMed:26077881, PubMed:26130459).
