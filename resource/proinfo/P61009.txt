UniprotID	P61009
Accession	P61009;P12280;Q9H0S7
EntryName	SPCS3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal peptidase complex subunit 3 (Microsomal signal peptidase 22/23 kDa subunit) (SPC22/23) (SPase 22/23 kDa subunit)
GeneName	SPCS3 SPC22 UNQ1841/PRO3567
Length	180
Function	Essential component of the signal peptidase complex (SPC) which catalyzes the cleavage of N-terminal signal sequences from nascent proteins as they are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:27499293, PubMed:34388369). Essential for the SPC catalytic activity, possibly by stabilizing and positioning the active center of the complex close to the lumenal surface (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
