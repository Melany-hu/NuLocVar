EntryName	ARGI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Arginase-1 (EC 3.5.3.1) (Liver-type arginase) (Type I arginase)
GeneName	ARG1
Length	322
Function	Key element of the urea cycle converting L-arginine to urea and L-ornithine, which is further metabolized into metabolites proline and polyamides that drive collagen synthesis and bioenergetic pathways critical for cell proliferation, respectively; the urea cycle takes place primarily in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys.
