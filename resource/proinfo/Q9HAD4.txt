EntryName	WDR41_HUMAN
ProteinName	WD repeat-containing protein 41
GeneName	WDR41 MSTP048
Length	459
Function	Non-catalytic component of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex, a complex that has guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity and regulates autophagy (PubMed:27103069, PubMed:27193190, PubMed:27617292, PubMed:28195531). The C9orf72-SMCR8 complex promotes the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting inactive GDP-bound RAB8A and RAB39B into their active GTP-bound form, thereby promoting autophagosome maturation (PubMed:27103069). As part of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex, stimulates RAB8A and RAB11A GTPase activity in vitro, however WDR42 is shown not be an essential complex component for this function (PubMed:32303654). The C9orf72-SMCR8 complex also acts as a negative regulator of autophagy initiation by interacting with the ULK1/ATG1 kinase complex and inhibiting its protein kinase activity (PubMed:27103069, PubMed:27617292).
