UniprotID	P23528
Accession	P23528;B3KUQ1;Q53Y87;Q9UCA2
EntryName	COF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cofilin-1 (18 kDa phosphoprotein) (p18) (Cofilin, non-muscle isoform)
GeneName	CFL1 CFL
Length	166
Function	Binds to F-actin and exhibits pH-sensitive F-actin depolymerizing activity (PubMed:11812157). In conjunction with the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), plays an essential role for zygotes to progress beyond the first embryonic cell divisions via regulation of actin dynamics (PubMed:15580268). Required for the centralization of the mitotic spindle and symmetric division of zygotes (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization in epithelial cells (PubMed:21834987). Required for the up-regulation of atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2 from endosomal compartment to cell membrane, increasing its efficiency in chemokine uptake and degradation (PubMed:23633677). Required for neural tube morphogenesis and neural crest cell migration (By similarity).
