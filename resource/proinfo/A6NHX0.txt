UniprotID	A6NHX0
Accession	A6NHX0;A6NNH0;B9EJH9
EntryName	CAST2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytosolic arginine sensor for mTORC1 subunit 2 (Cellular arginine sensor for mTORC1 protein 2) (GATS-like protein 2)
GeneName	CASTOR2 GATSL1 GATSL2
Length	329
Function	Functions as a negative regulator of the TORC1 signaling pathway through the GATOR complex. As part of homodimers or heterodimers with CASTOR1, directly binds and inhibits the GATOR subcomplex GATOR2 and thereby mTORC1. Does not directly bind arginine, but binding of arginine to CASTOR1 disrupts the interaction of CASTOR2-containing heterodimers with GATOR2 which can in turn activate mTORC1 and the TORC1 signaling pathway.
