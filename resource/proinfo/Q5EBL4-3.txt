UniprotID	Q5EBL4-3
Accession	Q5EBL4;Q66K36;Q8N1M0
EntryName	RIPL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RILP-like protein 1 (Rab-interacting lysosomal-like protein 1)
GeneName	RILPL1 RLP1
Length	252
Function	Plays a role in the regulation of cell shape and polarity (By similarity). Plays a role in cellular protein transport, including protein transport away from primary cilia (By similarity). Neuroprotective protein, which acts by sequestring GAPDH in the cytosol and prevent the apoptotic function of GAPDH in the nucleus (By similarity). Competes with SIAH1 for binding GAPDH (By similarity). Does not regulate lysosomal morphology and distribution (PubMed:14668488). Binds to RAB10 following LRRK2-mediated RAB10 phosphorylation which leads to inhibition of ciliogenesis (PubMed:30398148).
