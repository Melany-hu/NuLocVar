UniprotID	Q8NFJ5
Accession	Q8NFJ5;B3KV45;O95357
EntryName	RAI3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinoic acid-induced protein 3 (G-protein coupled receptor family C group 5 member A) (Phorbol ester induced gene 1) (PEIG-1) (Retinoic acid-induced gene 1 protein) (RAIG-1)
GeneName	GPRC5A GPCR5A RAI3 RAIG1
Length	357
Function	Orphan receptor. Could be involved in modulating differentiation and maintaining homeostasis of epithelial cells. This retinoic acid-inducible GPCR provide evidence for a possible interaction between retinoid and G-protein signaling pathways. Functions as a negative modulator of EGFR signaling (By similarity). May act as a lung tumor suppressor (PubMed:18000218).
