UniprotID	Q96QI5
Accession	Q96QI5;Q96RX7
EntryName	HS3S6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heparan sulfate glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 6 (EC 2.8.2.23) (Heparan sulfate D-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase 6) (3-OST-6) (Heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 6) (h3-OST-6)
GeneName	HS3ST6 HS3ST5
Length	342
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) to catalyze the transfer of a sulfo group to heparan sulfate. The substrate-specific O-sulfation generates an enzyme-modified heparan sulfate which acts as a binding receptor to Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) and permits its entry. Unlike 3-OST-1, does not convert non-anticoagulant heparan sulfate to anticoagulant heparan sulfate.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
