UniprotID	Q6NZY7
Accession	Q6NZY7;B0VJZ2;Q8TB51
EntryName	BORG3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cdc42 effector protein 5 (Binder of Rho GTPases 3)
GeneName	CDC42EP5 BORG3 CEP5
Length	148
Function	Probably involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. May act downstream of CDC42 to induce actin filament assembly leading to cell shape changes. Induces pseudopodia formation in fibroblasts. Inhibits MAPK8 independently of CDC42 binding. Controls septin organization and this effect is negatively regulated by CDC42 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endomembrane system; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
