EntryName	DPOLL_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA polymerase lambda (Pol Lambda) (EC 2.7.7.7) (EC 4.2.99.-) (DNA polymerase beta-2) (Pol beta2) (DNA polymerase kappa)
GeneName	POLL
Length	575
Function	DNA polymerase that functions in several pathways of DNA repair (PubMed:11457865, PubMed:19806195, PubMed:20693240, PubMed:30250067). Involved in base excision repair (BER) responsible for repair of lesions that give rise to abasic (AP) sites in DNA (PubMed:11457865, PubMed:19806195). Also contributes to DNA double-strand break repair by non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination (PubMed:19806195, PubMed:20693240, PubMed:30250067). Has both template-dependent and template-independent (terminal transferase) DNA polymerase activities (PubMed:10887191, PubMed:10982892, PubMed:12809503, PubMed:14627824, PubMed:15537631, PubMed:19806195). Also has a 5'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase (dRP lyase) activity (PubMed:11457865, PubMed:19806195).
