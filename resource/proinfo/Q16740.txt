UniprotID	Q16740
Accession	Q16740;B2R4W5
EntryName	CLPP_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic subunit, mitochondrial (EC 3.4.21.92) (Caseinolytic mitochondrial matrix peptidase proteolytic subunit) (Endopeptidase Clp)
GeneName	CLPP
Length	277
Function	Protease component of the ClpXP complex that cleaves peptides and various proteins in an ATP-dependent process. Has low peptidase activity in the absence of CLPX. The ClpXP complex can degrade CSN1S1, CSN2 and CSN3, as well as synthetic peptides (in vitro) and may be responsible for a fairly general and central housekeeping function rather than for the degradation of specific substrates (PubMed:11923310, PubMed:15522782). Cleaves PINK1 in the mitochondrion (PubMed:22354088).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
