UniprotID	Q9H1X1
Accession	Q9H1X1;A8K5T4;Q96NH9
EntryName	RSPH9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Radial spoke head protein 9 homolog
GeneName	RSPH9 C6orf206 MRPS18AL1
Length	276
Function	Functions as part of axonemal radial spoke complexes that play an important part in the motility of sperm and cilia (PubMed:19200523). Essential for both the radial spoke head assembly and the central pair microtubule stability in ependymal motile cilia (By similarity). Required for motility of olfactory and neural cilia and for the structural integrity of ciliary axonemes in both 9+0 and 9+2 motile cilia (By similarity).
