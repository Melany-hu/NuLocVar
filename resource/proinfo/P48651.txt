UniprotID	P48651
Accession	P48651;B4DE85;E5RFC5;Q9BUQ5
EntryName	PTSS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PSS-1) (PtdSer synthase 1) (EC 2.7.8.29) (Serine-exchange enzyme I)
GeneName	PTDSS1 KIAA0024 PSSA
Length	473
Function	Catalyzes a base-exchange reaction in which the polar head group of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or phosphatidylcholine (PC) is replaced by L-serine (PubMed:19014349, PubMed:24241535). Catalyzes mainly the conversion of phosphatidylcholine (PubMed:19014349, PubMed:24241535). Also converts, in vitro and to a lesser extent, phosphatidylethanolamine (PubMed:19014349, PubMed:24241535).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
