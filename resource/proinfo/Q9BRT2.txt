UniprotID	Q9BRT2
Accession	Q9BRT2;B2R4I0
EntryName	UQCC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor 2 (Breast cancer-associated protein SGA-81M) (Mitochondrial nucleoid factor 1) (Mitochondrial protein M19)
GeneName	UQCC2 C6orf125 MNF1
Length	126
Function	Required for the assembly of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex). Plays a role in the modulation of respiratory chain activities such as oxygen consumption and ATP production and via its modulation of the respiratory chain activity can regulate skeletal muscle differentiation and insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells. Involved in cytochrome b translation and/or stability.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix; Mitochondrion nucleoid; Mitochondrion; Mitochondrion intermembrane space; Mitochondrion matrix; Mitochondrion inner membrane
