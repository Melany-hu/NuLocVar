EntryName	FMO1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Flavin-containing monooxygenase 1 (EC 1.14.13.148) (EC 1.14.13.8) (Dimethylaniline monooxygenase [N-oxide-forming] 1) (Dimethylaniline oxidase 1) (Fetal hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenase 1) (FMO 1) (Trimethylamine monooxygenase)
GeneName	FMO1
Length	532
Function	Broad spectrum monooxygenase that catalyzes the oxygenation of a wide variety of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds including xenobiotics (PubMed:32156684). Catalyzes the S-oxygenation of hypotaurine to produce taurine, an organic osmolyte involved in cell volume regulation as well as a variety of cytoprotective and developmental processes (PubMed:32156684). In vitro, catalyzes the N-oxygenation of trimethylamine (TMA) to produce trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and could therefore participate to the detoxification of this compound that is generated by the action of gut microbiota from dietary precursors such as choline, choline containing compounds, betaine or L-carnitine (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
