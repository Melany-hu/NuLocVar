UniprotID	Q86YD5
Accession	Q86YD5;B7Z1U3;B9EG81;Q8NBJ0
EntryName	LRAD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain-containing protein 3 (LDLR class A domain-containing protein 3)
GeneName	LDLRAD3 LRAD3
Length	345
Function	May influence APP processing, resulting in a decrease in sAPP-alpha production and increased amyloidogenic P3 peptide production. May regulate ITCH and NEDD4 E3 ligase activity and degradation (PubMed:26854353).
