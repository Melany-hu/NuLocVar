UniprotID	P01242
Accession	P01242;B1A4H5;B1A4H7;O14643;O14644;P09587
EntryName	SOM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Growth hormone variant (GH-V) (Growth hormone 2) (Placenta-specific growth hormone)
GeneName	GH2
Length	217
Function	Plays an important role in growth control. Its major role in stimulating body growth is to stimulate the liver and other tissues to secrete IGF1. It stimulates both the differentiation and proliferation of myoblasts. It also stimulates amino acid uptake and protein synthesis in muscle and other tissues.
