UniprotID	A1L3X0
Accession	A1L3X0;Q589T3;Q9H5D0;Q9NT66
EntryName	ELOV7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Very long chain fatty acid elongase 7 (EC 2.3.1.199) (3-keto acyl-CoA synthase ELOVL7) (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 7) (ELOVL FA elongase 7) (Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 7) (Very long chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 7) (Very long chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA synthase 7)
GeneName	ELOVL7
Length	281
Function	Catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction of the four reactions that constitute the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle. This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process allows the addition of 2 carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) per cycle. Condensing enzyme with higher activity toward C18 acyl-CoAs, especially C18:3(n-3) acyl-CoAs and C18:3(n-6)-CoAs. Also active toward C20:4-, C18:0-, C18:1-, C18:2- and C16:0-CoAs, and weakly toward C20:0-CoA. Little or no activity toward C22:0-, C24:0-, or C26:0-CoAs. May participate in the production of saturated and polyunsaturated VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
