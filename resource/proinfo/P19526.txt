UniprotID	P19526
Accession	P19526;O14505;O14506;O14507
EntryName	FUT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Galactoside alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase 1 (Alpha(1,2)FT 1) (Blood group H alpha 2-fucosyltransferase) (Fucosyltransferase 1) (GDP-L-fucose:beta-D-galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 1) (Type 1 galactoside alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase FUT1) (EC 2.4.1.69) (Type 2 galactoside alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase FUT1) (EC 2.4.1.344)
GeneName	FUT1 H HSC
Length	365
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of L-fucose, from a guanosine diphosphate-beta-L-fucose, to the terminal galactose residue of glycoconjugates through an alpha(1,2) linkage leading to H antigen synthesis that is an intermediate substrate in the synthesis of ABO blood group antigens (PubMed:2118655). H antigen is essential for maturation of the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb, in cell migration and early cell-cell contacts during tumor associated angiogenesis (PubMed:18205178). Preferentially fucosylates soluble lactose and to a lesser extent fucosylates glycolipids gangliosides GA1 and GM1a (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack membrane
