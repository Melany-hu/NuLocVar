UniprotID	Q96BF3
Accession	Q96BF3;Q6UW59
EntryName	TMIG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane and immunoglobulin domain-containing protein 2 (CD28 homolog) (Immunoglobulin and proline-rich receptor 1) (IGPR-1)
GeneName	TMIGD2 CD28H IGPR1 UNQ3059/PRO9879
Length	282
Function	Plays a role in cell-cell interaction, cell migration, and angiogenesis. Through interaction with HHLA2, costimulates T-cells in the context of TCR-mediated activation. Enhances T-cell proliferation and cytokine production via an AKT-dependent signaling cascade.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
