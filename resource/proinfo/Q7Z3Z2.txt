UniprotID	Q7Z3Z2
Accession	Q7Z3Z2;A8K595
EntryName	RD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein RD3 (Retinal degeneration protein 3)
GeneName	RD3 C1orf36
Length	195
Function	Plays a critical role in the regulation of enzymes involved in nucleotide cycle in photoreceptors (PubMed:21078983, PubMed:21928830, PubMed:27471269, PubMed:29515371, PubMed:30559291). Inhibits the basal catalytic activity and the GCAP-stimulated activity of GUCY2D and GUCY2F, two retinal guanylyl cyclases involved in the production of cGMP in photoreceptors (PubMed:21928830, PubMed:27471269, PubMed:29515371, PubMed:30559291). Involved in the transport of GUCY2D and GUCY2F to their target sites in the photoreceptor outer segment (PubMed:21078983). Up-regulates the activity of GUK1, a kinase that also plays an essential role for recycling GMP and indirectly, cGMP (PubMed:29515371). Plays an important role for the survival of rods and cones in the retina (By similarity).
