Accession	P67775;P05323;P13197
EntryName	PP2AA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit alpha isoform (PP2A-alpha) (EC 3.1.3.16) (Replication protein C) (RP-C)
GeneName	PPP2CA
Length	309
Function	Catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of a wide variety of enzymes, signal transduction pathways, and cellular events (PubMed:10801873, PubMed:12473674, PubMed:17245430, PubMed:22613722, PubMed:33243860, PubMed:34004147, PubMed:9920888). PP2A is the major phosphatase for microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (PubMed:22613722). PP2A can modulate the activity of phosphorylase B kinase casein kinase 2, mitogen-stimulated S6 kinase, and MAP-2 kinase (PubMed:22613722). Cooperates with SGO2 to protect centromeric cohesin from separase-mediated cleavage in oocytes specifically during meiosis I (By similarity). Can dephosphorylate various proteins, such as SV40 large T antigen, AXIN1, p53/TP53, PIM3, WEE1 (PubMed:10801873, PubMed:12473674, PubMed:17245430, PubMed:9920888). Activates RAF1 by dephosphorylating it at 'Ser-259' (PubMed:10801873). Mediates dephosphorylation of WEE1, preventing its ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, increasing WEE1 protein levels, and promoting the G2/M checkpoint (PubMed:33108758). Mediates dephosphorylation of MYC; promoting its ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis: interaction with AMBRA1 enhances interaction between PPP2CA and MYC (PubMed:25438055). Mediates dephosphorylation of FOXO3; promoting its stabilization: interaction with AMBRA1 enhances interaction between PPP2CA and FOXO3 (PubMed:30513302). Catalyzes dephosphorylation of the pyrin domain of NLRP3, promoting assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome (By similarity). Together with RACK1 adapter, mediates dephosphorylation of AKT1 at 'Ser-473', preventing AKT1 activation and AKT-mTOR signaling pathway (By similarity). Dephosphorylation of AKT1 is essential for regulatory T-cells (Treg) homeostasis and stability (By similarity). Catalyzes dephosphorylation of PIM3, promotinh PIM3 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (PubMed:12473674). Part of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes (PubMed:33633399). STRIPAK complexes have critical roles in protein (de)phosphorylation and are regulators of multiple signaling pathways including Hippo, MAPK, nuclear receptor and cytoskeleton remodeling (PubMed:33633399). Different types of STRIPAK complexes are involved in a variety of biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism and immune regulation (PubMed:33633399). Key mediator of a quality checkpoint during transcription elongation as part of the Integrator-PP2A (INTAC) complex (PubMed:33243860, PubMed:34004147, PubMed:37080207). The INTAC complex drives premature transcription termination of transcripts that are unfavorably configured for transcriptional elongation: within the INTAC complex, PPP2CA catalyzes dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II subunit POLR2A/RPB1 and SUPT5H/SPT5, thereby preventing transcriptional elongation (PubMed:33243860, PubMed:34004147, PubMed:37080207).
