UniprotID	P14415
Accession	P14415;A0AV17;A8K278;D3DTQ2;O60444
EntryName	AT1B2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-2 (Adhesion molecule in glia) (AMOG) (Sodium/potassium-dependent ATPase subunit beta-2)
GeneName	ATP1B2
Length	290
Function	This is the non-catalytic component of the active enzyme, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the exchange of Na(+) and K(+) ions across the plasma membrane. The exact function of the beta-2 subunit is not known.
