EntryName	TPM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tropomyosin alpha-1 chain (Alpha-tropomyosin) (Tropomyosin-1)
GeneName	TPM1 C15orf13 TMSA
Length	284
Function	Binds to actin filaments in muscle and non-muscle cells (PubMed:23170982). Plays a central role, in association with the troponin complex, in the calcium dependent regulation of vertebrate striated muscle contraction (PubMed:23170982). Smooth muscle contraction is regulated by interaction with caldesmon. In non-muscle cells is implicated in stabilizing cytoskeleton actin filaments.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
