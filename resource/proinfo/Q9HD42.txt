UniprotID	Q9HD42
Accession	Q9HD42;A2RU09;Q14468;Q15779;Q96G31
EntryName	CHM1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Charged multivesicular body protein 1a (Chromatin-modifying protein 1a) (CHMP1a) (Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 46-1) (Vps46-1) (hVps46-1)
GeneName	CHMP1A CHMP1 KIAA0047 PCOLN3 PRSM1
Length	196
Function	Probable peripherally associated component of the endosomal sorting required for transport complex III (ESCRT-III) which is involved in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. Involved in cytokinesis. Involved in recruiting VPS4A and/or VPS4B to the midbody of dividing cells. May also be involved in chromosome condensation. Targets the Polycomb group (PcG) protein BMI1/PCGF4 to regions of condensed chromatin. May play a role in stable cell cycle progression and in PcG gene silencing.
