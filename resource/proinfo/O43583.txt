UniprotID	O43583
Accession	O43583;Q9H3U6;Q9UKZ0
EntryName	DENR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Density-regulated protein (DRP) (Protein DRP1) (Smooth muscle cell-associated protein 3) (SMAP-3)
GeneName	DENR DRP1 H14
Length	198
Function	Translation regulator forming a complex with MCTS1 to promote translation reinitiation. Translation reinitiation is the process where the small ribosomal subunit remains attached to the mRNA following termination of translation of a regulatory upstream ORF (uORF), and resume scanning on the same mRNA molecule to initiate translation of a downstream ORF, usually the main ORF (mORF). The MCTS1/DENR complex is pivotal to two linked mechanisms essential for translation reinitiation. Firstly, the dissociation of deacylated tRNAs from post-termination 40S ribosomal complexes during ribosome recycling. Secondly, the recruitment in an EIF2-independent manner of aminoacylated initiator tRNA to P site of 40S ribosomes for a new round of translation. This regulatory mechanism governs the translation of more than 150 genes which translation reinitiation is MCTS1/DENR complex-dependent.
