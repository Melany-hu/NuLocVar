UniprotID	Q6ZSA7
Accession	Q6ZSA7;A7E2U7;B2RN81
EntryName	LRC55_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 55 (BK channel auxiliary gamma subunit LRRC55)
GeneName	LRRC55
Length	298
Function	Auxiliary protein of the large-conductance, voltage and calcium-activated potassium channel (BK alpha). Modulates gating properties by producing a marked shift in the BK channel's voltage dependence of activation in the hyperpolarizing direction, and in the absence of calcium.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
