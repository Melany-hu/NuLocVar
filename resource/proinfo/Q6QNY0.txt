UniprotID	Q6QNY0
Accession	Q6QNY0;B2RXB8
EntryName	BL1S3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 subunit 3 (BLOC-1 subunit 3)
GeneName	BLOC1S3 BLOS3
Length	202
Function	Component of the BLOC-1 complex, a complex that is required for normal biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LRO), such as platelet dense granules and melanosomes. In concert with the AP-3 complex, the BLOC-1 complex is required to target membrane protein cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals. The BLOC-1 complex, in association with SNARE proteins, is also proposed to be involved in neurite extension. Plays a role in intracellular vesicle trafficking.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
