UniprotID	O95292
Accession	O95292;A2A2F2;O95293;Q9P0H0
EntryName	VAPB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B/C (VAMP-B/VAMP-C) (VAMP-associated protein B/C) (VAP-B/VAP-C)
GeneName	VAPB UNQ484/PRO983
Length	243
Function	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored protein that mediates the formation of contact sites between the ER and endosomes via interaction with FFAT motif-containing proteins such as STARD3 or WDR44 (PubMed:32344433, PubMed:33124732). Interacts with STARD3 in a FFAT motif phosphorylation dependent manner (PubMed:33124732). Via interaction with WDR44 participates in neosynthesized protein export (PubMed:32344433). Participates in the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) by inducing ERN1/IRE1 activity (PubMed:16891305, PubMed:20940299). Involved in cellular calcium homeostasis regulation (PubMed:22131369).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
