UniprotID	P49190
Accession	P49190;Q8N429
EntryName	PTH2R_HUMAN
ProteinName	Parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (PTH2 receptor)
GeneName	PTH2R PTHR2
Length	550
Function	This is a specific receptor for parathyroid hormone. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylyl cyclase. PTH2R may be responsible for PTH effects in a number of physiological systems. It may play a significant role in pancreatic function. PTH2R presence in neurons indicates that it may function as a neurotransmitter receptor (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
