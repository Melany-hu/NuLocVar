EntryName	FA7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Coagulation factor VII (EC 3.4.21.21) (Proconvertin) (Serum prothrombin conversion accelerator) (SPCA) (Eptacog alfa) [Cleaved into: Factor VII light chain; Factor VII heavy chain]
GeneName	F7
Length	466
Function	Initiates the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. Serine protease that circulates in the blood in a zymogen form. Factor VII is converted to factor VIIa by factor Xa, factor XIIa, factor IXa, or thrombin by minor proteolysis. In the presence of tissue factor and calcium ions, factor VIIa then converts factor X to factor Xa by limited proteolysis. Factor VIIa also converts factor IX to factor IXa in the presence of tissue factor and calcium (PubMed:271951).
