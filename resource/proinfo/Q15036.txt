EntryName	SNX17_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sorting nexin-17
GeneName	SNX17 KIAA0064
Length	470
Function	Critical regulator of endosomal recycling of numerous surface proteins, including integrins, signaling receptor and channels (PubMed:15121882, PubMed:15769472). Binds to NPxY sequences in the cytoplasmic tails of target cargos (PubMed:21512128). Associates with retriever and CCC complexes to prevent lysosomal degradation and promote cell surface recycling of numerous cargos such as integrins ITGB1, ITGB5 and their associated alpha subunits (PubMed:22492727, PubMed:28892079). Also required for maintenance of normal cell surface levels of APP and LRP1 (PubMed:16712798, PubMed:19005208). Interacts with membranes containing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3P)) (PubMed:16712798).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Early endosome; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane
