UniprotID	P67936
Accession	P67936;P07226;Q15659;Q5U0D9;Q9BU85;Q9H8Q3;Q9UCS1;Q9UCS2;Q9UCS3;Q9UCS4
EntryName	TPM4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tropomyosin alpha-4 chain (TM30p1) (Tropomyosin-4)
GeneName	TPM4
Length	248
Function	Binds to actin filaments in muscle and non-muscle cells. Plays a central role, in association with the troponin complex, in the calcium dependent regulation of vertebrate striated muscle contraction. Smooth muscle contraction is regulated by interaction with caldesmon. In non-muscle cells is implicated in stabilizing cytoskeleton actin filaments (By similarity). Binds calcium (PubMed:1836432). Plays a role in platelet biogenesis.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
