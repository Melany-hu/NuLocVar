UniprotID	Q9NZQ9
Accession	Q9NZQ9;B7Z6N9;Q5JR83;Q8WVL3;Q9UKH2
EntryName	TMOD4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tropomodulin-4 (Skeletal muscle tropomodulin) (Sk-Tmod)
GeneName	TMOD4
Length	345
Function	Blocks the elongation and depolymerization of the actin filaments at the pointed end. The Tmod/TM complex contributes to the formation of the short actin protofilament, which in turn defines the geometry of the membrane skeleton.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
