UniprotID	Q9BU64
Accession	Q9BU64;B2RDC0;D6W536;Q53T55;Q96JV3
EntryName	CENPO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Centromere protein O (CENP-O) (Interphase centromere complex protein 36)
GeneName	CENPO ICEN36 MCM21R
Length	300
Function	Component of the CENPA-CAD (nucleosome distal) complex, a complex recruited to centromeres which is involved in assembly of kinetochore proteins, mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. May be involved in incorporation of newly synthesized CENPA into centromeres via its interaction with the CENPA-NAC complex. Modulates the kinetochore-bound levels of NDC80 complex.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome; Centromere; Chromosome; Centromere; Kinetochore
