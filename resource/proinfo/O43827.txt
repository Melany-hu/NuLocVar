EntryName	ANGL7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Angiopoietin-related protein 7 (Angiopoietin-like factor) (Angiopoietin-like protein 7) (Cornea-derived transcript 6 protein)
GeneName	ANGPTL7 CDT6 UNQ313/PRO356
Length	346
Function	Has a role in the formation and organization of the extracellular matrix. In the eye, it functions as a mediator of dexamethasone-induced matrix deposition in the trabecular meshwork, the tissue responsible for the outflow of the ocular aqueous humor and for the maintenance of intraocular pressure (PubMed:21199193). Is a negative regulator of angiogenesis in the cornea, and plays a major role in maintaining corneal avascularity and transparency (PubMed:25622036).
