UniprotID	P18847
Accession	P18847;Q5VTZ2;Q6ICQ9;Q7Z566;Q8WYM6
EntryName	ATF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor ATF-3 (cAMP-dependent transcription factor ATF-3) (Activating transcription factor 3)
GeneName	ATF3
Length	181
Function	This protein binds the cAMP response element (CRE) (consensus: 5'-GTGACGT-3'), a sequence present in many viral and cellular promoters. Represses transcription from promoters with ATF sites. It may repress transcription by stabilizing the binding of inhibitory cofactors at the promoter.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
