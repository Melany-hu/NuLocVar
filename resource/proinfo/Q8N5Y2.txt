EntryName	MS3L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	MSL complex subunit 3 (Male-specific lethal 3 homolog) (Male-specific lethal-3 homolog 1) (Male-specific lethal-3 protein-like 1) (MSL3-like 1)
GeneName	MSL3 MSL3L1
Length	521
Function	Non-catalytic component of the MSL histone acetyltransferase complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates the majority of histone H4 acetylation at 'Lys-16' (H4K16ac), an epigenetic mark that prevents chromatin compaction (PubMed:16227571, PubMed:16543150, PubMed:20018852, PubMed:20657587, PubMed:20943666, PubMed:21217699, PubMed:30224647, PubMed:33837287). The MSL complex is required for chromosome stability and genome integrity by maintaining homeostatic levels of H4K16ac (PubMed:33837287). The MSL complex is also involved in gene dosage by promoting up-regulation of genes expressed by the X chromosome (By similarity). X up-regulation is required to compensate for autosomal biallelic expression (By similarity). The MSL complex also participates in gene dosage compensation by promoting expression of Tsix non-coding RNA (By similarity). Acts as a histone reader that specifically recognizes and binds histone H4 monomethylated at 'Lys-20' (H4K20Me1) in a DNA-dependent manner and is proposed to be involved in chromosomal targeting of the MSL complex (PubMed:20657587, PubMed:20943666). May play a role X inactivation in females (PubMed:21217699).
