UniprotID	P08246
Accession	P08246;P09649;Q6B0D9;Q6LDP5
EntryName	ELNE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neutrophil elastase (EC 3.4.21.37) (Bone marrow serine protease) (Elastase-2) (Human leukocyte elastase) (HLE) (Medullasin) (PMN elastase)
GeneName	ELANE ELA2
Length	267
Function	Serine protease that modifies the functions of natural killer cells, monocytes and granulocytes. Inhibits C5a-dependent neutrophil enzyme release and chemotaxis (PubMed:15140022). Promotes cleavage of GSDMB, thereby inhibiting pyroptosis (PubMed:36899106). Promotes blood coagulation (PubMed:20676107). Through the activation of the platelet fibrinogen receptor integrin alpha-IIb/beta-3, potentiates platelet aggregation induced by a threshold concentration of cathepsin G (CTSG) (PubMed:25211214, PubMed:9111081). Cleaves and thus inactivates tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (PubMed:20676107, PubMed:25211214). Capable of killing E.coli but not S.aureus in vitro; digests outer membrane protein A (ompA) in E.coli and K.pneumoniae (PubMed:10947984).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Phagosome
