UniprotID	O00322
Accession	O00322;Q3KNU5;Q3KNU6
EntryName	UPK1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Uroplakin-1a (UP1a) (Tetraspanin-21) (Tspan-21) (Uroplakin Ia) (UPIa) (UPKa)
GeneName	UPK1A TSPAN21
Length	258
Function	Component of the asymmetric unit membrane (AUM); a highly specialized biomembrane elaborated by terminally differentiated urothelial cells. May play an important role in normal bladder epithelial physiology, possibly in regulating membrane permeability of superficial umbrella cells or in stabilizing the apical membrane through AUM/cytoskeletal interactions (By similarity).
