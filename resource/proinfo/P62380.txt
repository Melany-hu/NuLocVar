UniprotID	P62380
Accession	P62380;A8K8F5;O95753;Q9BWD5;Q9Z2Z0
EntryName	TBPL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	TATA box-binding protein-like 1 (TBP-like 1) (21 kDa TBP-like protein) (Second TBP of unique DNA protein) (STUD) (TATA box-binding protein-related factor 2) (TBP-related factor 2) (TBP-like factor) (TBP-related protein)
GeneName	TBPL1 TLF TLP TLP21 TRF2 TRP
Length	186
Function	Part of a specialized transcription system that mediates the transcription of most ribosomal proteins through the 5'-TCT-3' motif which is a core promoter element at these genes. Seems to also mediate the transcription of NF1. Does not bind the TATA box.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus
