UniprotID	Q9BXW4
Accession	Q9BXW4;A0PJY8;A2RUP0
EntryName	MLP3C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 gamma (Autophagy-related protein LC3 C) (Autophagy-related ubiquitin-like modifier LC3 C) (MAP1 light chain 3-like protein 3) (Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3C) (MAP1A/MAP1B LC3 C) (MAP1A/MAP1B light chain 3 C)
GeneName	MAP1LC3C
Length	147
Function	Ubiquitin-like modifier that plays a crucial role in antibacterial autophagy (xenophagy) through the selective binding of CALCOCO2 (PubMed:23022382). Recruits all ATG8 family members to infecting bacteria such as S.typhimurium (PubMed:23022382). May also play a role in aggrephagy, the macroautophagic degradation of ubiquitinated and aggregated proteins (PubMed:28404643).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome membrane; Endomembrane system; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
