UniprotID	Q9HCC0
Accession	Q9HCC0;A6NIY9;Q96C27;Q9Y4L7
EntryName	MCCB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase beta chain, mitochondrial (MCCase subunit beta) (EC 6.4.1.4) (3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 2) (3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase non-biotin-containing subunit) (3-methylcrotonyl-CoA:carbon dioxide ligase subunit beta)
GeneName	MCCC2 MCCB
Length	563
Function	Carboxyltransferase subunit of the 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA to 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA, a critical step for leucine and isovaleric acid catabolism.
