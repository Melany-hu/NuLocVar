UniprotID	P13385
Accession	P13385;Q8TCC1
EntryName	TDGF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Cripto (Cripto, EGF-CFC family member) (Cripto-1 growth factor) (CRGF) (Epidermal growth factor-like cripto protein CR1) (Teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor 1)
GeneName	CRIPTO CRIPTO-1 TDGF1
Length	188
Function	GPI-anchored cell membrane protein involved in Nodal signaling. Cell-associated CRIPTO acts as a Nodal coreceptor in cis. Shedding of CRIPTO by TMEM8A modulates Nodal signaling by allowing soluble CRIPTO to act as a Nodal coreceptor on other cells (PubMed:27881714). Could play a role in the determination of the epiblastic cells that subsequently give rise to the mesoderm (PubMed:11909953).
