UniprotID	P56915
Accession	P56915;Q86YR1
EntryName	GSC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein goosecoid
GeneName	GSC
Length	257
Function	Regulates chordin (CHRD). May play a role in spatial programing within discrete embryonic fields or lineage compartments during organogenesis. In concert with NKX3-2, plays a role in defining the structural components of the middle ear; required for the development of the entire tympanic ring (By similarity). Probably involved in the regulatory networks that define neural crest cell fate specification and determine mesoderm cell lineages in mammals.
