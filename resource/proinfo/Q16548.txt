UniprotID	Q16548
Accession	Q16548;Q6FGZ4;Q6FH19;Q86W13;Q99524
EntryName	B2LA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bcl-2-related protein A1 (Bcl-2-like protein 5) (Bcl2-L-5) (Hemopoietic-specific early response protein) (Protein BFL-1) (Protein GRS)
GeneName	BCL2A1 BCL2L5 BFL1 GRS HBPA1
Length	175
Function	Retards apoptosis induced by IL-3 deprivation. May function in the response of hemopoietic cells to external signals and in maintaining endothelial survival during infection (By similarity). Can inhibit apoptosis induced by serum starvation in the mammary epithelial cell line HC11 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
