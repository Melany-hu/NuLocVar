UniprotID	P43220
Accession	P43220;Q2M229;Q99669
EntryName	GLP1R_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1 receptor) (GLP-1-R) (GLP-1R)
GeneName	GLP1R
Length	463
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) (PubMed:19861722, PubMed:26308095, PubMed:27196125, PubMed:28514449, PubMed:7517895, PubMed:8216285, PubMed:8405712). Ligand binding triggers activation of a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of adenylyl cyclase and increased intracellular cAMP levels (PubMed:19861722, PubMed:26308095, PubMed:27196125, PubMed:28514449, PubMed:7517895, PubMed:8216285, PubMed:8405712). Plays a role in regulating insulin secretion in response to GLP-1 (By similarity).
