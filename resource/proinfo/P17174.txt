ProteinName	Aspartate aminotransferase, cytoplasmic (cAspAT) (EC 2.6.1.1) (EC 2.6.1.3) (Cysteine aminotransferase, cytoplasmic) (Cysteine transaminase, cytoplasmic) (cCAT) (Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 1) (Transaminase A)
GeneName	GOT1
Length	413
Function	Biosynthesis of L-glutamate from L-aspartate or L-cysteine (PubMed:21900944). Important regulator of levels of glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter of the vertebrate central nervous system. Acts as a scavenger of glutamate in brain neuroprotection. The aspartate aminotransferase activity is involved in hepatic glucose synthesis during development and in adipocyte glyceroneogenesis. Using L-cysteine as substrate, regulates levels of mercaptopyruvate, an important source of hydrogen sulfide. Mercaptopyruvate is converted into H(2)S via the action of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST). Hydrogen sulfide is an important synaptic modulator and neuroprotectant in the brain. In addition, catalyzes (2S)-2-aminobutanoate, a by-product in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway (PubMed:27827456).
