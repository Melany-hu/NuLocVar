ProteinName	Proteasome subunit beta type-5 (EC 3.4.25.1) (Macropain epsilon chain) (Multicatalytic endopeptidase complex epsilon chain) (Proteasome chain 6) (Proteasome epsilon chain) (Proteasome subunit MB1) (Proteasome subunit X) (Proteasome subunit beta-5) (beta-5)
GeneName	PSMB5 LMPX MB1 X
Length	160
Function	Component of the 20S core proteasome complex involved in the proteolytic degradation of most intracellular proteins. This complex plays numerous essential roles within the cell by associating with different regulatory particles. Associated with two 19S regulatory particles, forms the 26S proteasome and thus participates in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Associated with the PA200 or PA28, the 20S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation. This type of proteolysis is required in several pathways including spermatogenesis (20S-PA200 complex) or generation of a subset of MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides (20S-PA28 complex). Within the 20S core complex, PSMB5 displays a chymotrypsin-like activity.
