UniprotID	Q96E22
Accession	Q96E22;B2RWQ4;O00251
EntryName	NGBR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase complex subunit NUS1 (EC 2.5.1.87) (Cis-prenyltransferase subunit NgBR) (Nogo-B receptor) (NgBR) (Nuclear undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase 1 homolog)
GeneName	NUS1 C6orf68 NGBR
Length	293
Function	With DHDDS, forms the dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase (DDS) complex, an essential component of the dolichol monophosphate (Dol-P) biosynthetic machinery (PubMed:21572394, PubMed:25066056, PubMed:28842490, PubMed:32817466, PubMed:33077723). Both subunits contribute to enzymatic activity, i.e. condensation of multiple copies of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to produce dehydrodolichyl diphosphate (Dedol-PP), a precursor of dolichol phosphate which is utilized as a sugar carrier in protein glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (PubMed:21572394, PubMed:25066056, PubMed:28842490, PubMed:32817466, PubMed:33077723). Synthesizes long-chain polyprenols, mostly of C95 and C100 chain length (PubMed:32817466). Regulates the glycosylation and stability of nascent NPC2, thereby promoting trafficking of LDL-derived cholesterol (PubMed:21572394). Acts as a specific receptor for the N-terminus of Nogo-B, a neural and cardiovascular regulator (PubMed:16835300).
