ProteinName	Vitamin K-dependent protein C (EC 3.4.21.69) (Anticoagulant protein C) (Autoprothrombin IIA) (Blood coagulation factor XIV) [Cleaved into: Vitamin K-dependent protein C light chain; Vitamin K-dependent protein C heavy chain; Activation peptide]
GeneName	PROC
Length	461
Function	Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease that regulates blood coagulation by inactivating factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of calcium ions and phospholipids (PubMed:25618265). Exerts a protective effect on the endothelial cell barrier function (PubMed:25651845).
