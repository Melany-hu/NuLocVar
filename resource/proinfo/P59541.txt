UniprotID	P59541
Accession	P59541;Q645X7
EntryName	T2R30_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 30 (T2R30) (Taste receptor type 2 member 47) (T2R47)
GeneName	TAS2R30 TAS2R47
Length	319
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5 (By similarity).
