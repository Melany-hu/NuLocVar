EntryName	NEK6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase Nek6 (EC 2.7.11.34) (Never in mitosis A-related kinase 6) (NimA-related protein kinase 6) (Protein kinase SID6-1512)
GeneName	NEK6
Length	313
Function	Protein kinase which plays an important role in mitotic cell cycle progression (PubMed:11516946, PubMed:14563848). Required for chromosome segregation at metaphase-anaphase transition, robust mitotic spindle formation and cytokinesis (PubMed:19414596). Phosphorylates ATF4, CIR1, PTN, RAD26L, RBBP6, RPS7, RPS6KB1, TRIP4, STAT3 and histones H1 and H3 (PubMed:12054534, PubMed:20873783). Phosphorylates KIF11 to promote mitotic spindle formation (PubMed:19001501). Involved in G2/M phase cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage (PubMed:18728393). Inhibition of activity results in apoptosis. May contribute to tumorigenesis by suppressing p53/TP53-induced cancer cell senescence (PubMed:21099361). Phosphorylates EML4 at 'Ser-144', promoting its dissociation from microtubules during mitosis which is required for efficient chromosome congression (PubMed:31409757).
