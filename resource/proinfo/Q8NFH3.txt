EntryName	NUP43_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleoporin Nup43 (Nup107-160 subcomplex subunit Nup43) (p42)
GeneName	NUP43
Length	380
Function	Component of the Nup107-160 subcomplex of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The Nup107-160 subcomplex is required for the assembly of a functional NPC. The Nup107-160 subcomplex is also required for normal kinetochore microtubule attachment, mitotic progression and chromosome segregation.
