UniprotID	Q86Y82
Accession	Q86Y82;B1AJQ7;O95564
EntryName	STX12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Syntaxin-12
GeneName	STX12
Length	276
Function	SNARE promoting fusion of transport vesicles with target membranes. Together with SNARE STX6, promotes movement of vesicles from endosomes to the cell membrane, and may therefore function in the endocytic recycling pathway. Through complex formation with GRIP1, GRIA2 and NSG1 controls the intracellular fate of AMPAR and the endosomal sorting of the GRIA2 subunit toward recycling and membrane targeting.
Subcellular Location	Endosome membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Endomembrane system; Early endosome membrane; Recycling endosome membrane
