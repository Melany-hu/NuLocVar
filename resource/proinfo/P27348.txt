UniprotID	P27348
Accession	P27348;D6W4Z5;Q567U5;Q5TZU8;Q9UP48
EntryName	1433T_HUMAN
ProteinName	14-3-3 protein theta (14-3-3 protein T-cell) (14-3-3 protein tau) (Protein HS1)
GeneName	YWHAQ
Length	245
Function	Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathways. Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner. Negatively regulates the kinase activity of PDPK1.
