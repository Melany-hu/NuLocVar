UniprotID	Q86SH2
Accession	Q86SH2
EntryName	ZAR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zygote arrest protein 1
GeneName	ZAR1
Length	424
Function	mRNA-binding protein that mediates formation of MARDO (mitochondria-associated ribonucleoprotein domain), a membraneless compartment that stores maternal mRNAs in oocytes. MARDO assembly around mitochondria is directed by an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential during oocyte growth. Promotes formation of MARDO phase-separated membraneless compartment by undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation upon binding to maternal mRNAs. Binds to the 3'-UTR of maternal mRNAs. Maternal mRNAs stored in the MARDO are translationally repressed. Essential for female fertility and oocyte-to-embryo transition by coordinating maternal mRNA storage, translation and degradation.
