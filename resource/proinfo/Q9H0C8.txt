UniprotID	Q9H0C8
Accession	Q9H0C8;B3KM39
EntryName	ILKAP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Integrin-linked kinase-associated serine/threonine phosphatase 2C (ILKAP) (EC 3.1.3.16)
GeneName	ILKAP
Length	392
Function	Protein phosphatase that may play a role in regulation of cell cycle progression via dephosphorylation of its substrates whose appropriate phosphorylation states might be crucial for cell proliferation. Selectively associates with integrin linked kinase (ILK), to modulate cell adhesion and growth factor signaling. Inhibits the ILK-GSK3B signaling axis and may play an important role in inhibiting oncogenic transformation.
