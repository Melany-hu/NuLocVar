Function	Plays an important role in cell protection against oxidative stress and in the regulation of redox-related calcium homeostasis. Regulates the calcium level of the ER by protecting the calcium pump ATP2A2 against the oxidoreductase ERO1A-mediated oxidative damage. Within the ER, ERO1A activity increases the concentration of H(2)O(2), which attacks the luminal thiols in ATP2A2 and thus leads to cysteinyl sulfenic acid formation (-SOH) and SEPN1 reduces the SOH back to free thiol (-SH), thus restoring ATP2A2 activity (PubMed:25452428). Acts as a modulator of ryanodine receptor (RyR) activity: protects RyR from oxidation due to increased oxidative stress, or directly controls the RyR redox state, regulating the RyR-mediated calcium mobilization required for normal muscle development and differentiation (PubMed:18713863, PubMed:19557870).
