UniprotID	Q6PH85
Accession	Q6PH85;Q5JSA5;Q5JSA6;Q5JSA7;Q9NVJ1;Q9NXR6
EntryName	DCNL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	DCN1-like protein 2 (DCNL2) (DCUN1 domain-containing protein 2) (Defective in cullin neddylation protein 1-like protein 2)
GeneName	DCUN1D2 C13orf17 DCUN1L2
Length	259
Function	Contributes to the neddylation of all cullins by transferring NEDD8 from N-terminally acetylated NEDD8-conjugating E2s enzyme to different cullin C-terminal domain-RBX complexes and plays an essential role in the regulation of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein)-type complexes activity.
