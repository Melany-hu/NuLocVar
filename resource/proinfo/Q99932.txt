EntryName	SPAG8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sperm-associated antigen 8 (HSD-1) (Sperm membrane protein 1) (SMP-1) (Sperm membrane protein BS-84)
GeneName	SPAG8
Length	485
Function	Microtubule inner protein (MIP) part of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in cilia axoneme, which is required for motile cilia beating (PubMed:36191189). Plays a role in spermatogenesis by enhancing the binding of CREM isoform tau to its coactivator FHL5 and increasing the FHL5-regulated transcriptional activation of CREM isoform tau (By similarity). Involved in the acrosome reaction and in binding of sperm to the zona pellucida (By similarity). Plays a role in regulation of the cell cycle by controlling progression through the G2/M phase, possibly by delaying the activation of CDK1 which is required for entry into mitosis (PubMed:19548270). May play a role in fertility and microtubule formation through interaction with RANBP9 (PubMed:10500252).
