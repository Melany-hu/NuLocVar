UniprotID	O60239
Accession	O60239;B3KQW6;Q5JWV9
EntryName	3BP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	SH3 domain-binding protein 5 (SH3BP-5) (SH3 domain-binding protein that preferentially associates with BTK)
GeneName	SH3BP5 SAB
Length	455
Function	Functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) with specificity for RAB11A and RAB25 (PubMed:26506309, PubMed:30217979). Inhibits the auto- and transphosphorylation activity of BTK. Plays a negative regulatory role in BTK-related cytoplasmic signaling in B-cells. May be involved in BCR-induced apoptotic cell death.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Mitochondrion
