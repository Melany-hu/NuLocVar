UniprotID	P05154
Accession	P05154;Q07616;Q9UG30
EntryName	IPSP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Plasma serine protease inhibitor (Acrosomal serine protease inhibitor) (Plasminogen activator inhibitor 3) (PAI-3) (PAI3) (Protein C inhibitor) (PCI) (Serpin A5)
GeneName	SERPINA5 PCI PLANH3 PROCI
Length	406
Function	Heparin-dependent serine protease inhibitor acting in body fluids and secretions. Inactivates serine proteases by binding irreversibly to their serine activation site. Involved in the regulation of intravascular and extravascular proteolytic activities. Plays hemostatic roles in the blood plasma. Acts as a procoagulant and pro-inflammatory factor by inhibiting the anticoagulant activated protein C factor as well as the generation of activated protein C factor by the thrombin/thrombomodulin complex. Acts as an anticoagulant factor by inhibiting blood coagulation factors like prothrombin, factor XI, factor Xa, plasma kallikrein and fibrinolytic enzymes such as tissue- and urinary-type plasminogen activators. In seminal plasma, inactivates several serine proteases implicated in the reproductive system. Inhibits the serpin acrosin; indirectly protects component of the male genital tract from being degraded by excessive released acrosin. Inhibits tissue- and urinary-type plasminogen activator, prostate-specific antigen and kallikrein activities; has a control on the sperm motility and fertilization. Inhibits the activated protein C-catalyzed degradation of SEMG1 and SEMG2; regulates the degradation of semenogelin during the process of transfer of spermatozoa from the male reproductive tract into the female tract. In urine, inhibits urinary-type plasminogen activator and kallikrein activities. Inactivates membrane-anchored serine proteases activities such as MPRSS7 and TMPRSS11E. Inhibits urinary-type plasminogen activator-dependent tumor cell invasion and metastasis. May also play a non-inhibitory role in seminal plasma and urine as a hydrophobic hormone carrier by its binding to retinoic acid.
