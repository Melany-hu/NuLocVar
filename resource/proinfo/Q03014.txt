UniprotID	Q03014
Accession	Q03014;B1AQ17;Q96CE9
EntryName	HHEX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hematopoietically-expressed homeobox protein HHEX (Homeobox protein HEX) (Homeobox protein PRH) (Proline-rich homeodomain protein)
GeneName	HHEX HEX PRH PRHX
Length	270
Function	Recognizes the DNA sequence 5'-ATTAA-3' (By similarity). Transcriptional repressor (By similarity). Activator of WNT-mediated transcription in conjunction with CTNNB1 (PubMed:20028982). Establishes anterior identity at two levels; acts early to enhance canonical WNT-signaling by repressing expression of TLE4, and acts later to inhibit NODAL-signaling by directly targeting NODAL (By similarity). Inhibits EIF4E-mediated mRNA nuclear export (PubMed:12554669). May play a role in hematopoietic differentiation (PubMed:8096636).
