EntryName	PALS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein PALS1 (MAGUK p55 subfamily member 5) (Membrane protein, palmitoylated 5) (Protein associated with Lin-7 1)
GeneName	PALS1 MPP5
Length	675
Function	Plays a role in tight junction biogenesis and in the establishment of cell polarity in epithelial cells (PubMed:16678097, PubMed:25385611). Also involved in adherens junction biogenesis by ensuring correct localization of the exocyst complex protein EXOC4/SEC8 which allows trafficking of adherens junction structural component CDH1 to the cell surface (By similarity). Plays a role through its interaction with CDH5 in vascular lumen formation and endothelial membrane polarity (PubMed:27466317). Required during embryonic and postnatal retinal development (By similarity). Required for the maintenance of cerebellar progenitor cells in an undifferentiated proliferative state, preventing premature differentiation, and is required for cerebellar histogenesis, fissure formation, cerebellar layer organization and cortical development (By similarity). Plays a role in neuronal progenitor cell survival, potentially via promotion of mTOR signaling (By similarity). Plays a role in the radial and longitudinal extension of the myelin sheath in Schwann cells (By similarity). May modulate SC6A1/GAT1-mediated GABA uptake by stabilizing the transporter (By similarity). Plays a role in the T-cell receptor-mediated activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:21479189). Required for localization of EZR to the apical membrane of parietal cells and may play a role in the dynamic remodeling of the apical cytoskeleton (By similarity). Required for the normal polarized localization of the vesicular marker STX4 (By similarity). Required for the correct trafficking of the myelin proteins PMP22 and MAG (By similarity). Involved in promoting phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of transcriptional coactivators YAP1 and WWTR1/TAZ which leads to suppression of TGFB1-dependent transcription of target genes such as CCN2/CTGF, SERPINE1/PAI1, SNAI1/SNAIL1 and SMAD7 (By similarity).
