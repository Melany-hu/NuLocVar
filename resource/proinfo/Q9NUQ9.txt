EntryName	CYRIB_HUMAN
ProteinName	CYFIP-related Rac1 interactor B (L1)
GeneName	CYRIB CYRI FAM49B BM-009
Length	324
Function	Negatively regulates RAC1 signaling and RAC1-driven cytoskeletal remodeling (PubMed:30250061, PubMed:31285585). Regulates chemotaxis, cell migration and epithelial polarization by controlling the polarity, plasticity, duration and extent of protrusions. Limits Rac1 mediated activation of the Scar/WAVE complex, focuses protrusion signals and regulates pseudopod complexity by inhibiting Scar/WAVE-induced actin polymerization (PubMed:30250061). Protects against Salmonella bacterial infection. Attenuates processes such as macropinocytosis, phagocytosis and cell migration and restrict sopE-mediated bacterial entry (PubMed:31285585). Also restricts infection mediated by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes (By similarity). Involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and oxidative stress (PubMed:29059164).
