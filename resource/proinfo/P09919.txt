UniprotID	P09919
Accession	P09919;A8MXR7
EntryName	CSF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (Pluripoietin) (Filgrastim) (Lenograstim)
GeneName	CSF3 C17orf33 GCSF
Length	207
Function	Granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factors are cytokines that act in hematopoiesis by controlling the production, differentiation, and function of 2 related white cell populations of the blood, the granulocytes and the monocytes-macrophages. This CSF induces granulocytes.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
