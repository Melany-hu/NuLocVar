EntryName	ENTR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endosome-associated-trafficking regulator 1 (Antigen NY-CO-3) (Serologically defined colon cancer antigen 3)
GeneName	ENTR1 SDCCAG3
Length	435
Function	Endosome-associated protein that plays a role in membrane receptor sorting, cytokinesis and ciliogenesis (PubMed:23108400, PubMed:25278552, PubMed:27767179). Involved in the endosome-to-plasma membrane trafficking and recycling of SNX27-retromer-dependent cargo proteins, such as GLUT1 (PubMed:25278552). Involved in the regulation of cytokinesis; the function may involve PTPN13 and GIT1 (PubMed:23108400). Plays a role in the formation of cilia (PubMed:27767179). Involved in cargo protein localization, such as PKD2, at primary cilia (PubMed:27767179). Involved in the presentation of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor TNFRSF1A on the cell surface, and hence in the modulation of the TNF-induced apoptosis (By similarity).
