UniprotID	Q969F0
Accession	Q969F0
EntryName	FATE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fetal and adult testis-expressed transcript protein (Cancer/testis antigen 43) (CT43) (Tumor antigen BJ-HCC-2)
GeneName	FATE1 FATE
Length	183
Function	Involved in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria coupling. Negatively regulates the ER-mitochondria distance and Ca(2+) transfer from ER to mitochondria possibly implicating it in the regulation of apoptosis (PubMed:27402544). May collaborate with RNF183 to restrain BIK protein levels thus regulating apoptotic signaling (PubMed:26567849).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion; Mitochondrion outer membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
