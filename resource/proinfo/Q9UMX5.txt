EntryName	NENF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neudesin (Cell immortalization-related protein 2) (Neuron-derived neurotrophic factor) (Protein GIG47) (Secreted protein of unknown function) (SPUF protein)
GeneName	NENF CIR2 SPUF
Length	172
Function	Acts as a neurotrophic factor in postnatal mature neurons enhancing neuronal survival (PubMed:31536960). Promotes cell proliferation and neurogenesis in undifferentiated neural progenitor cells at the embryonic stage and inhibits differentiation of astrocytes (By similarity). Its neurotrophic activity is exerted via MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and AKT1/AKT pathways (By similarity). Neurotrophic activity is enhanced by binding to heme (By similarity). Also acts as an anorexigenic neurotrophic factor that contributes to energy balance (By similarity).
