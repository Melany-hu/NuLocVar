UniprotID	Q9Y3A3
Accession	Q9Y3A3;B4DML0;Q53SE0;Q7Z4Y6;Q9H2P3;Q9H5J1;Q9Y4T8
EntryName	PHOCN_HUMAN
ProteinName	MOB-like protein phocein (2C4D) (Class II mMOB1) (Mob1 homolog 3) (Mob3) (Mps one binder kinase activator-like 3) (Preimplantation protein 3)
GeneName	MOB4 MOB3 MOBKL3 PHOCN PREI3 CGI-95
Length	225
Function	Part of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. STRIPAK complexes have critical roles in protein (de)phosphorylation and are regulators of multiple signaling pathways including Hippo, MAPK, nuclear receptor and cytoskeleton remodeling. Different types of STRIPAK complexes are involved in a variety of biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism and immune regulation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region; Membrane; Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack membrane
