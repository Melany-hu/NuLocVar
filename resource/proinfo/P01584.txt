EntryName	IL1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) (Catabolin)
GeneName	IL1B IL1F2
Length	269
Function	Potent pro-inflammatory cytokine (PubMed:10653850, PubMed:12794819, PubMed:28331908, PubMed:3920526). Initially discovered as the major endogenous pyrogen, induces prostaglandin synthesis, neutrophil influx and activation, T-cell activation and cytokine production, B-cell activation and antibody production, and fibroblast proliferation and collagen production (PubMed:3920526). Promotes Th17 differentiation of T-cells. Synergizes with IL12/interleukin-12 to induce IFNG synthesis from T-helper 1 (Th1) cells (PubMed:10653850). Plays a role in angiogenesis by inducing VEGF production synergistically with TNF and IL6 (PubMed:12794819). Involved in transduction of inflammation downstream of pyroptosis: its mature form is specifically released in the extracellular milieu by passing through the gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pore (PubMed:33377178, PubMed:33883744). Acts as a sensor of S.pyogenes infection in skin: cleaved and activated by pyogenes SpeB protease, leading to an inflammatory response that prevents bacterial growth during invasive skin infection (PubMed:28331908).
