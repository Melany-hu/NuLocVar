Length	399
Function	Chromatin binding factor that binds to DNA sequence specific sites and regulates the 3D structure of chromatin (PubMed:18347100, PubMed:18654629, PubMed:19322193). Binds together strands of DNA, thus forming chromatin loops, and anchors DNA to cellular structures, such as the nuclear lamina (PubMed:18347100, PubMed:18654629, PubMed:19322193). Defines the boundaries between active and heterochromatic DNA via binding to chromatin insulators, thereby preventing interaction between promoter and nearby enhancers and silencers (PubMed:18347100, PubMed:18654629, PubMed:19322193). Plays a critical role in the epigenetic regulation (PubMed:16949368). Participates in the allele-specific gene expression at the imprinted IGF2/H19 gene locus (PubMed:16107875, PubMed:16815976, PubMed:17827499). On the maternal allele, binding within the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) mediates maternally inherited higher-order chromatin conformation to restrict enhancer access to IGF2 (By similarity). Mediates interchromosomal association between IGF2/H19 and WSB1/NF1 and may direct distant DNA segments to a common transcription factory (By similarity). Regulates asynchronous replication of IGF2/H19 (By similarity). Plays a critical role in gene silencing over considerable distances in the genome (By similarity). Preferentially interacts with unmethylated DNA, preventing spreading of CpG methylation and maintaining methylation-free zones (PubMed:18413740). Inversely, binding to target sites is prevented by CpG methylation (PubMed:18413740). Plays an important role in chromatin remodeling (PubMed:18413740). Can dimerize when it is bound to different DNA sequences, mediating long-range chromatin looping (PubMed:12191639). Causes local loss of histone acetylation and gain of histone methylation in the beta-globin locus, without affecting transcription (PubMed:12191639). When bound to chromatin, it provides an anchor point for nucleosomes positioning (PubMed:12191639). Seems to be essential for homologous X-chromosome pairing (By similarity). May participate with Tsix in establishing a regulatable epigenetic switch for X chromosome inactivation (PubMed:11743158). May play a role in preventing the propagation of stable methylation at the escape genes from X-inactivation (PubMed:11743158). Involved in sister chromatid cohesion (PubMed:12191639). Associates with both centromeres and chromosomal arms during metaphase and required for cohesin localization to CTCF sites (PubMed:18550811). Plays a role in the recruitment of CENPE to the pericentromeric/centromeric regions of the chromosome during mitosis (PubMed:26321640). Acts as a transcriptional repressor binding to promoters of vertebrate MYC gene and BAG1 gene (PubMed:18413740, PubMed:8649389, PubMed:9591631). Also binds to the PLK and PIM1 promoters (PubMed:12191639). Acts as a transcriptional activator of APP (PubMed:9407128). Regulates APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster and controls MHC class II gene expression (PubMed:18347100, PubMed:19322193). Plays an essential role in oocyte and preimplantation embryo development by activating or repressing transcription (By similarity). Seems to act as tumor suppressor (PubMed:12191639).
