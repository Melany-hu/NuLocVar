UniprotID	Q13323
Accession	Q13323;Q16582;Q6FH93
EntryName	BIK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bcl-2-interacting killer (Apoptosis inducer NBK) (BIP1) (BP4)
GeneName	BIK NBK
Length	160
Function	Accelerates programmed cell death. Association to the apoptosis repressors Bcl-X(L), BHRF1, Bcl-2 or its adenovirus homolog E1B 19k protein suppresses this death-promoting activity. Does not interact with BAX.
Subcellular Location	Endomembrane system; Mitochondrion membrane
