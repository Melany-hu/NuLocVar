UniprotID	P46089
Accession	P46089;A8K570
EntryName	GPR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 3 (ACCA orphan receptor)
GeneName	GPR3 ACCA
Length	330
Function	Constitutively active G-protein coupled receptor that maintains high 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels that a plays a role in serveral processes including meiotic arrest in oocytes or neuronal development via activation of numerous intracellular signaling pathways. Acts as an essential activator of thermogenic adipocytes and drives thermogenesis via its intrinsic G(s)-coupling activity without the requirement of a ligand (PubMed:34048700). Has a potential role in modulating a number of brain functions, including behavioral responses to stress (By similarity), amyloid-beta peptide generation in neurons (By similarity). Stimulates neurite outgrowth in cerebellar granular neurons modulated via PKA, ERK, and most strongly PI3K-mediated signaling pathways (By similarity).
