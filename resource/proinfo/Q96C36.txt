EntryName	P5CR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 2 (P5C reductase 2) (P5CR 2) (EC 1.5.1.2)
GeneName	PYCR2
Length	320
Function	Oxidoreductase that catalyzes the last step in proline biosynthesis, which corresponds to the reduction of pyrroline-5-carboxylate to L-proline using NAD(P)H (PubMed:23024808, PubMed:2722838, PubMed:6894153). At physiologic concentrations, has higher specific activity in the presence of NADH (PubMed:23024808, PubMed:2722838, PubMed:6894153). Involved in cellular response to oxidative stress (PubMed:25865492). In some cell types, such as erythrocytes, its primary function may be the generation of NADP(+) (PubMed:2722838, PubMed:6894153).
