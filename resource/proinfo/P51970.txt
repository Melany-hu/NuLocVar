UniprotID	P51970
Accession	P51970;B1AM93;Q9Y6N0
EntryName	NDUA8_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 8 (Complex I-19kD) (CI-19kD) (Complex I-PGIV) (CI-PGIV) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 19 kDa subunit)
GeneName	NDUFA8
Length	172
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis (PubMed:27626371, PubMed:32385911, PubMed:33153867). Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain (PubMed:27626371). The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone (PubMed:27626371).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Mitochondrion intermembrane space; Mitochondrion
