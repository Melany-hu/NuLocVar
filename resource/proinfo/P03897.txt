UniprotID	P03897
Accession	P03897
EntryName	NU3M_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 3 (EC 7.1.1.2) (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3)
GeneName	MT-ND3 MTND3 NADH3 ND3
Length	115
Function	Core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) which catalyzes electron transfer from NADH through the respiratory chain, using ubiquinone as an electron acceptor (PubMed:25118196). Essential for the catalytic activity of complex I (PubMed:25118196).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
