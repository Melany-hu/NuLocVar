UniprotID	Q99879
Accession	Q99879;Q6NWQ3
EntryName	H2B1M_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type 1-M (Histone H2B.e) (H2B/e)
GeneName	H2BC14 H2BFE HIST1H2BM
Length	126
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
