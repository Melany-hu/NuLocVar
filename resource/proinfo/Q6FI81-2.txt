EntryName	CPIN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Anamorsin (Cytokine-induced apoptosis inhibitor 1) (Fe-S cluster assembly protein DRE2 homolog)
GeneName	CIAPIN1 CUA001 PRO0915
Length	108
Function	Component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein assembly (CIA) machinery required for the maturation of extramitochondrial Fe-S proteins. Part of an electron transfer chain functioning in an early step of cytosolic Fe-S biogenesis, facilitating the de novo assembly of a  cluster on the scaffold complex NUBP1-NUBP2. Electrons are transferred to CIAPIN1 from NADPH via the FAD- and FMN-containing protein NDOR1 (PubMed:23596212). NDOR1-CIAPIN1 are also required for the assembly of the diferric tyrosyl radical cofactor of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), probably by providing electrons for reduction during radical cofactor maturation in the catalytic small subunit (By similarity). Has anti-apoptotic effects in the cell. Involved in negative control of cell death upon cytokine withdrawal. Promotes development of hematopoietic cells (By similarity).
