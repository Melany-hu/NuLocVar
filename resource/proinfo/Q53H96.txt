UniprotID	Q53H96
Accession	Q53H96;B3KMB5;B4DVT6;H0Y6C3;Q8N3N9;Q96HX4;Q9H896
EntryName	P5CR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 3 (P5C reductase 3) (P5CR 3) (EC 1.5.1.2) (Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase-like protein)
GeneName	PYCR3 PYCRL
Length	274
Function	Oxidoreductase that catalyzes the last step in proline biosynthesis, which corresponds to the reduction of pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) to L-proline using NAD(P)H (PubMed:23024808, PubMed:36414121). Proline is synthesized from either glutamate or ornithine; both are converted to P5C, and then to proline via pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductases (PYCRs) (PubMed:23024808). PYCR3 is exclusively linked to the biosynthesis of proline from ornithine (PubMed:23024808).
