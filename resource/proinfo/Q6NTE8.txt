UniprotID	Q6NTE8
Accession	Q6NTE8;B5MD09;E9PAK6;Q7Z3D8;Q9BUC1;Q9UN54
EntryName	MRNIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	MRN complex-interacting protein (MRN-interacting protein)
GeneName	MRNIP C5orf45
Length	343
Function	Plays a role in the cellular response to DNA damage and the maintenance of genome stability through its association with the MRN damage-sensing complex (PubMed:27568553). Promotes chromatin loading and activity of the MRN complex to facilitate subsequent ATM-mediated DNA damage response signaling and DNA repair (PubMed:27568553).
