UniprotID	Q8TCB7
Accession	Q8TCB7;Q96LU4
EntryName	METL6_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA N(3)-cytidine methyltransferase METTL6 (EC 2.1.1.-) (Methyltransferase-like protein 6) (hMETTL6)
GeneName	METTL6
Length	284
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase that mediates N(3)-methylcytidine modification of residue 32 of the tRNA anticodon loop of tRNA(Ser), including tRNA(Ser)(UGA) and tRNA(Ser)(GCU) (PubMed:32923617, PubMed:34268557, PubMed:34862464, PubMed:34922197). Interaction with SARS1/SerRS is required for N(3)-methylcytidine methylation (PubMed:34268557).
