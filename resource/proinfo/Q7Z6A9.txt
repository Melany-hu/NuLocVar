UniprotID	Q7Z6A9
Accession	Q7Z6A9;Q3B831;Q3HS85;Q6ZNH9
EntryName	BTLA_HUMAN
ProteinName	B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (B- and T-lymphocyte-associated protein) (CD antigen CD272)
GeneName	BTLA
Length	289
Function	Inhibitory receptor on lymphocytes that negatively regulates antigen receptor signaling via PTPN6/SHP-1 and PTPN11/SHP-2 (PubMed:12796776, PubMed:14652006, PubMed:15568026, PubMed:18193050). May interact in cis (on the same cell) or in trans (on other cells) with TNFRSF14 (PubMed:19915044). In cis interactions, appears to play an immune regulatory role inhibiting in trans interactions in naive T cells to maintain a resting state. In trans interactions, can predominate during adaptive immune response to provide survival signals to effector T cells (PubMed:19915044).
