UniprotID	P35408
Accession	P35408;Q3MJ87
EntryName	PE2R4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP4 subtype (PGE receptor EP4 subtype) (PGE2 receptor EP4 subtype) (Prostanoid EP4 receptor)
GeneName	PTGER4 PTGER2
Length	488
Function	Receptor for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The activity of this receptor is mediated by G(s) proteins that stimulate adenylate cyclase. Has a relaxing effect on smooth muscle. May play an important role in regulating renal hemodynamics, intestinal epithelial transport, adrenal aldosterone secretion, and uterine function.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
