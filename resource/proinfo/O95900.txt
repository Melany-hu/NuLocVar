UniprotID	O95900
Accession	O95900;B7Z7G5
EntryName	TRUB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pseudouridylate synthase TRUB2, mitochondrial (EC 5.4.99.-) (TruB pseudouridine synthase homolog 2) (tRNA pseudouridine 55 synthase TRUB2) (Psi55 synthase TRUB2) (EC 5.4.99.25)
GeneName	TRUB2
Length	331
Function	Minor enzyme contributing to the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine (pseudouridylation) of specific mitochondrial mRNAs (mt-mRNAs) such as COXI and COXIII mt-mRNAs (PubMed:27974379, PubMed:31477916). As a component of a functional protein-RNA module, consisting of RCC1L, NGRN, RPUSD3, RPUSD4, TRUB2, FASTKD2 and 16S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (16S mt-rRNA), controls 16S mt-rRNA abundance and is required for intra-mitochondrial translation (PubMed:27667664). Also catalyzes pseudouridylation of some tRNAs, including synthesis of pseudouridine(55) from uracil-55, in the psi GC loop of a subset of tRNAs (PubMed:33023933).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
