UniprotID	Q9UGY1
Accession	Q9UGY1
EntryName	NOL12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleolar protein 12
GeneName	NOL12
Length	213
Function	Multifunctional RNA binding protein that plays a role in RNA metabolism and DNA maintenance. Participates in the resolution of DNA stress and the maintenance of genome integrity by localizing to sites of DNA insults (PubMed:29069457). Also plays a role in proper nucleolar organization by limiting nucleolar size and regulating nucleolar number. Mechanistically, regulates the nucleolar levels of fibrillarin and nucleolin, two key players in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly (PubMed:30988155).
