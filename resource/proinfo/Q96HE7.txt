EntryName	ERO1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	ERO1-like protein alpha (ERO1-L) (ERO1-L-alpha) (EC 1.8.4.-) (Endoplasmic oxidoreductin-1-like protein) (Endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase alpha) (Oxidoreductin-1-L-alpha)
GeneName	ERO1A ERO1L UNQ434/PRO865
Length	468
Function	Oxidoreductase involved in disulfide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum. Efficiently reoxidizes P4HB/PDI, the enzyme catalyzing protein disulfide formation, in order to allow P4HB to sustain additional rounds of disulfide formation. Following P4HB reoxidation, passes its electrons to molecular oxygen via FAD, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell. Required for the proper folding of immunoglobulins (PubMed:29858230). Plays an important role in ER stress-induced, CHOP-dependent apoptosis by activating the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor IP3R1. Involved in the release of the unfolded cholera toxin from reduced P4HB/PDI in case of infection by V.cholerae, thereby playing a role in retrotranslocation of the toxin.
