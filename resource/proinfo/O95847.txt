UniprotID	O95847
Accession	O95847;F5GWR4;Q5VTS9;Q8N518
EntryName	UCP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 4 (UCP 4) (Solute carrier family 25 member 27)
GeneName	SLC25A27 UCP4 UNQ772/PRO1566
Length	323
Function	Facilitates proton transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane and may dissipate excessive proton gradient associated with oxidative and metabolic stress at neuronal synapses. Regulates glutamate-induced proton conductance in astrocytes, shifting the energy metabolism toward aerobic glycolysis and lactate transfer to neurons for ATP synthesis. Can transport chloride ions with lower efficiency. The transport mechanism remains to be elucidated.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
