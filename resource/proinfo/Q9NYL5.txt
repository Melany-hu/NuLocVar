UniprotID	Q9NYL5
Accession	Q9NYL5;Q5VTT0;Q96FW5
EntryName	CP39A_HUMAN
ProteinName	24-hydroxycholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.14.26) (Cytochrome P450 39A1) (hCYP39A1) (Oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase)
GeneName	CYP39A1
Length	469
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in neural cholesterol clearance through bile acid synthesis (PubMed:10748047, PubMed:25201972). Catalyzes 7-alpha hydroxylation of (24S)-hydroxycholesterol, a neural oxysterol that is metabolized to bile acids in the liver (PubMed:10748047, PubMed:25201972). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR; NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:10748047, PubMed:25201972).
