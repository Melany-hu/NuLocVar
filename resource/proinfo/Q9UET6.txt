UniprotID	Q9UET6
Accession	Q9UET6;B2RCJ0;O75670
EntryName	TRM7_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA (cytidine(32)/guanosine(34)-2'-O)-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.205) (2'-O-ribose RNA methyltransferase TRM7 homolog) (Protein ftsJ homolog 1)
GeneName	FTSJ1 JM23
Length	329
Function	Methylates the 2'-O-ribose of nucleotides at positions 32 and 34 of the tRNA anticodon loop of substrate tRNAs (PubMed:25404562, PubMed:26310293, PubMed:32198346, PubMed:32558197, PubMed:33771871, PubMed:36720500). Requisite for faithful cytoplasmic translation (PubMed:32393790). Requires THADA for methylation of the nucleotide at position 32 of the anticodon loop of substrate tRNAs (PubMed:25404562, PubMed:26310293). Requires WDR6 for methylation of the nucleotide at position 34 of the anticodon loop of substrate tRNAs (PubMed:32558197, PubMed:33771871). Promotes translation efficiency of the UUU codon (PubMed:32558197). Plays a role in neurogenesis (PubMed:36720500). Required for expression of genes involved in neurogenesis, mitochondrial translation and energy generation, and lipid biosynthesis (PubMed:33771871, PubMed:36720500). Requisite for RNA-mediated gene silencing (PubMed:36720500). May modify position 32 in tRNA(Arg(ACG)), tRNA(Arg(CCG)), tRNA(Arg(UCG)), tRNA(Cys(GCA)), tRNA(Cys(ACA)), tRNA(Gln(CUG)), tRNA(Gln(UUG)), tRNA(Gly(CCC)), tRNA(Leu(CAG))/tRNA(Leu(CAA)), tRNA(Leu(A/IAG)), tRNA(Leu(UAG)), tRNA(Phe(GAA)), tRNA(Pro(AGG))/tRNA(Pro(CGG))/tRNA(Pro(UGG)) and tRNA(Trp(CCA)), and position 34 in tRNA(Phe(GAA)), tRNA(Leu(CAA)), tRNA(Sec(UCA)), and tRNA(Trp(CCA)) (PubMed:26310293, PubMed:32198346, PubMed:32558197, PubMed:33771871, PubMed:36720500).
