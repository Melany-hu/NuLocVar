UniprotID	Q9HBY0
Accession	Q9HBY0;Q9HBJ9
EntryName	NOX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADPH oxidase 3 (EC 1.6.3.-) (Mitogenic oxidase 2) (MOX-2) (gp91phox homolog 3) (GP91-3)
GeneName	NOX3 MOX2
Length	568
Function	NADPH oxidase that catalyzes the generation of superoxide from molecular oxygen utilizing NADPH as an electron donor, upon formation of a complex with CYBA/p22phox (PubMed:15181005, PubMed:15824103). Plays a role in the biogenesis of otoconia/otolith, which are crystalline structures of the inner ear involved in the perception of gravity (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
