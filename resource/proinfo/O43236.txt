EntryName	SEPT4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Septin-4 (Bradeion beta) (Brain protein H5) (CE5B3 beta) (Cell division control-related protein 2) (hCDCREL-2) (Peanut-like protein 2)
GeneName	SEPTIN4 C17orf47 PNUTL2 SEP4 SEPT4 hucep-7
Length	478
Function	Filament-forming cytoskeletal GTPase (Probable). Pro-apoptotic protein involved in LGR5-positive intestinal stem cell and Paneth cell expansion in the intestines, via its interaction with XIAP (By similarity). May also play a role in the regulation of cell fate in the intestine (By similarity). Positive regulator of apoptosis involved in hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis; via its interaction with XIAP (By similarity). Negative regulator of repair and hair follicle regeneration in response to injury, due to inhibition of hair follicle stem cell proliferation, potentially via its interaction with XIAP (By similarity). Plays an important role in male fertility and sperm motility (By similarity). During spermiogenesis, essential for the establishment of the annulus (a fibrous ring structure connecting the midpiece and the principal piece of the sperm flagellum) which is a requisite for the structural and mechanical integrity of the sperm (By similarity). Involved in the migration of cortical neurons and the formation of neuron leading processes during embryonic development (By similarity). Required for dopaminergic metabolism in presynaptic autoreceptors; potentially via activity as a presynaptic scaffold protein (By similarity).
