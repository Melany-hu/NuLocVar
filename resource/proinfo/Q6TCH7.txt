UniprotID	Q6TCH7
Accession	Q6TCH7;A8K5B7;B3KP59;Q6PIQ1;Q86X05;Q8NCP9
EntryName	PAQR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 3 (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member III) (Raf kinase trapping to Golgi) (RKTG)
GeneName	PAQR3
Length	311
Function	Golgi-scaffold protein which modulates its interactors acitivies by anchoring them to the Golgi apparatus (PubMed:18547165, PubMed:26311497). Functions as a spatial regulator of RAF1 kinase by sequestrating it to the Golgi apparatus (PubMed:18547165). Acts as a positive regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis by mediating the anchoring of the SCAP:SREBP complex in the Golgi apparatus, thereby promoting SCAP:SREBF2 complex formation, potentiating SREBF2 and SREBF1 processing and enhancing lipid synthesis (PubMed:26311497). Also regulates PPARA and PPARG functions by mediating their interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as STUB1 or HUWE1, leading to their polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
