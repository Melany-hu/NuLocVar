EntryName	GEMI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gem-associated protein 2 (Gemin-2) (Component of gems 2) (Survival of motor neuron protein-interacting protein 1) (SMN-interacting protein 1)
GeneName	GEMIN2 SIP1
Length	280
Function	The SMN complex catalyzes the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome, and thereby plays an important role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs (PubMed:18984161, PubMed:9323129). Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP (Sm core) (PubMed:18984161). In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG (5Sm) are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP (PubMed:18984161). To assemble core snRNPs, the SMN complex accepts the trapped 5Sm proteins from CLNS1A (PubMed:18984161, PubMed:9323129). Binding of snRNA inside 5Sm ultimately triggers eviction of the SMN complex, thereby allowing binding of SNRPD3 and SNRPB to complete assembly of the core snRNP (PubMed:31799625). Within the SMN complex, GEMIN2 constrains the conformation of 5Sm, thereby promoting 5Sm binding to snRNA containing the snRNP code (a nonameric Sm site and a 3'-adjacent stem-loop), thus preventing progression of assembly until a cognate substrate is bound (PubMed:16314521, PubMed:21816274, PubMed:31799625).
