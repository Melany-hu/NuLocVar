Accession	Q96LJ7;D3DS71;Q8NDG3;Q96B59;Q96CQ5
EntryName	DHRS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 1 (EC 1.1.1.-) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 19C member 1) (Protein SDR19C1)
GeneName	DHRS1 SDR19C1
Length	313
Function	NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase which catalyzes the reduction of steroids (estrone, androstene-3,17-dione and cortisone) as well as prostaglandin E1, isatin and xenobiotics in vitro (PubMed:30031147). May have a role in steroid and/or xenobiotic metabolism (PubMed:30031147).
