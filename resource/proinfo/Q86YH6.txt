UniprotID	Q86YH6
Accession	Q86YH6;Q33DR4;Q4G158;Q5VU38;Q5VU39;Q9NR58
EntryName	DLP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	All trans-polyprenyl-diphosphate synthase PDSS2 (All-trans-decaprenyl-diphosphate synthase subunit 2) (EC 2.5.1.91) (Candidate tumor suppressor protein) (Decaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase subunit 2) (Decaprenyl-diphosphate synthase subunit 2) (Solanesyl-diphosphate synthase subunit 2)
GeneName	PDSS2 C6orf210 DLP1
Length	399
Function	Heterotetrameric enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), which acts as a primer, and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to produce prenyl diphosphates of varying chain lengths and participates in the determination of the side chain of ubiquinone (PubMed:16262699). Supplies nona and decaprenyl diphosphate, the precursors for the side chain of the isoprenoid quinones ubiquinone-9 (Q9) and ubiquinone-10 (Q10) respectively (PubMed:16262699). The enzyme adds isopentenyl diphosphate molecules sequentially to farnesyl diphosphate with trans stereochemistry (PubMed:16262699). May play a role during cerebellar development (By similarity). May regulate mitochondrial respiratory chain function (By similarity).
