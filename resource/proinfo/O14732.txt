UniprotID	O14732
Accession	O14732;B0YJ29;Q9UJT3
EntryName	IMPA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inositol monophosphatase 2 (IMP 2) (IMPase 2) (EC 3.1.3.25) (Inositol-1(or 4)-monophosphatase 2) (Myo-inositol monophosphatase A2)
GeneName	IMPA2 IMP.18P
Length	288
Function	Phosphatase that can use myo-inositol monophosphates, myo-inositol 1,4-diphosphate, scyllo-inositol-1,4-diphosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, beta-glycerophosphate and 2'-AMP as substrates in vitro (PubMed:17068342). It is likely that IMPA2 has an as yet unidentified in vivo substrate(s) (PubMed:17068342). Has been implicated as the pharmacological target for lithium (Li(+)) action in brain (PubMed:17068342).
