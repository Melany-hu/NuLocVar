UniprotID	Q9NZL4
Accession	Q9NZL4;B3KQP0;B4DG11;O95351;Q6ZNU5
EntryName	HPBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hsp70-binding protein 1 (HspBP1) (Heat shock protein-binding protein 1) (Hsp70-binding protein 2) (HspBP2) (Hsp70-interacting protein 1) (Hsp70-interacting protein 2)
GeneName	HSPBP1 HSPBP PP1845
Length	359
Function	Inhibits HSPA1A chaperone activity by changing the conformation of the ATP-binding domain of HSPA1A and interfering with ATP binding. Interferes with ubiquitination mediated by STUB1 and inhibits chaperone-assisted degradation of immature CFTR.
