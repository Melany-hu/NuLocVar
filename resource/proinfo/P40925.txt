EntryName	MDHC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Malate dehydrogenase, cytoplasmic (EC 1.1.1.37) (Aromatic alpha-keto acid reductase) (KAR) (EC 1.1.1.96) (Cytosolic malate dehydrogenase)
GeneName	MDH1 MDHA
Length	334
Function	Catalyzes the reduction of aromatic alpha-keto acids in the presence of NADH (PubMed:2449162, PubMed:3052244). Plays essential roles in the malate-aspartate shuttle and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, important in mitochondrial NADH supply for oxidative phosphorylation (PubMed:31538237). Catalyzes the reduction of 2-oxoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) (PubMed:34012073).
