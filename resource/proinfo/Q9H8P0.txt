UniprotID	Q9H8P0
Accession	Q9H8P0;Q4W5Q6
EntryName	SR5A3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polyprenal reductase (EC 1.3.1.94) (3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase 3) (EC 1.3.1.22) (Steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2-like) (Steroid 5-alpha-reductase 3) (S5AR 3) (SR type 3)
GeneName	SRD5A3 SRD5A2L
Length	318
Function	Plays a key role in early steps of protein N-linked glycosylation by being involved in the conversion of polyprenol into dolichol (PubMed:20637498, PubMed:38821050). Acts as a polyprenal reductase that mediates the reduction of polyprenal into dolichal in a NADP-dependent mechanism (PubMed:38821050). Dolichols are required for the synthesis of dolichol-linked monosaccharides and the oligosaccharide precursor used for N-glycosylation (PubMed:20637498, PubMed:38821050). Also able to convert testosterone (T) into 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (PubMed:17986282, PubMed:26855069).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
