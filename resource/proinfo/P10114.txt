UniprotID	P10114
Accession	P10114;B2RCJ1;Q5JSC1;Q5JSC2
EntryName	RAP2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rap-2a (EC 3.6.5.2) (RbBP-30)
GeneName	RAP2A
Length	183
Function	Small GTP-binding protein which cycles between a GDP-bound inactive and a GTP-bound active form. In its active form interacts with and regulates several effectors including MAP4K4, MINK1 and TNIK. Part of a signaling complex composed of NEDD4, RAP2A and TNIK which regulates neuronal dendrite extension and arborization during development. More generally, it is part of several signaling cascades and may regulate cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell migration, cell adhesion and cell spreading.
Subcellular Location	Recycling endosome membrane; Midbody
