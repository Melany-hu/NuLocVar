Accession	P46091;A5JUU6;A8K4L1;Q53TR9;Q6NVX4
EntryName	CML2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chemerin-like receptor 2 (Chemerin chemokine-like receptor 2) (Chemokine-like receptor 2) (G-protein coupled receptor 1)
GeneName	CMKLR2 GPR1
Length	355
Function	Receptor for chemoattractant adipokine chemerin/RARRES2 suggesting a role for this receptor in the regulation of inflammation and energy homesotasis (PubMed:18165312, PubMed:27716822). Signals mainly via beta-arrestin pathway. Binding of RARRES2 activates weakly G proteins, calcium mobilization and MAPK1/MAPK3 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation too (PubMed:27716822). Also acts as a receptor for TAFA1, mediates its effects on neuronal stem-cell proliferation and differentiation via the activation of ROCK/ERK and ROCK/STAT3 signaling pathway (By similarity).
