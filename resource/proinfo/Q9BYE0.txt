UniprotID	Q9BYE0
Accession	Q9BYE0;F8VPC9
EntryName	HES7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor HES-7 (hHes7) (Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 37) (bHLHb37) (Hairy and enhancer of split 7) (bHLH factor Hes7)
GeneName	HES7 BHLHB37
Length	225
Function	Transcriptional repressor. Represses transcription from both N box- and E box-containing promoters. May with HES1, cooperatively regulate somite formation in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM). May function as a segmentation clock, which is essential for coordinated somite segmentation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
