UniprotID	Q9UI95
Accession	Q9UI95;B3KNE3;Q5TGW7;Q9UNA7;Q9Y6I6
EntryName	MD2L2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2B (Mitotic arrest deficient 2-like protein 2) (MAD2-like protein 2) (REV7 homolog) (hREV7)
GeneName	MAD2L2 MAD2B REV7
Length	211
Function	Adapter protein able to interact with different proteins and involved in different biological processes (PubMed:11459825, PubMed:11459826, PubMed:17296730, PubMed:17719540, PubMed:19443654, PubMed:29656893). Mediates the interaction between the error-prone DNA polymerase zeta catalytic subunit REV3L and the inserter polymerase REV1, thereby mediating the second polymerase switching in translesion DNA synthesis (PubMed:20164194). Translesion DNA synthesis releases the replication blockade of replicative polymerases, stalled in presence of DNA lesions (PubMed:20164194). Component of the shieldin complex, which plays an important role in repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:29656893). During G1 and S phase of the cell cycle, the complex functions downstream of TP53BP1 to promote non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and suppress DNA end resection (PubMed:29656893). Mediates various NHEJ-dependent processes including immunoglobulin class-switch recombination, and fusion of unprotected telomeres (PubMed:29656893). May also regulate another aspect of cellular response to DNA damage through regulation of the JNK-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the transcriptional activator ELK1 (PubMed:17296730). Inhibits the FZR1- and probably CDC20-mediated activation of the anaphase promoting complex APC thereby regulating progression through the cell cycle (PubMed:11459825, PubMed:17719540). Regulates TCF7L2-mediated gene transcription and may play a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (PubMed:19443654).
