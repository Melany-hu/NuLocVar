EntryName	LICH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysosomal acid lipase/cholesteryl ester hydrolase (Acid cholesteryl ester hydrolase) (LAL) (EC 3.1.1.13) (Cholesteryl esterase) (Diacylglycerol lipase) (Lipase A) (Sterol esterase) (Triacylglycerol ester hydrolase) (Triacylglycerol lipase)
GeneName	LIPA
Length	399
Function	Catalyzes the deacylation of cholesteryl ester core lipids of endocytosed low density lipoproteins to generate free fatty acids and cholesterol (PubMed:15269241, PubMed:1718995, PubMed:7204383, PubMed:8112342, PubMed:9633819). Hydrolyzes triglycerides (1,2,3-triacylglycerol) and diglycerides (such as 1,2-diacylglycerol and 1,3-diacylglycerol) with preference for the acyl moieties at the sn-1 or sn-3 positions (PubMed:7204383, PubMed:8112342).
