UniprotID	Q92765
Accession	Q92765;O00181;Q99686
EntryName	SFRP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (sFRP-3) (Frezzled) (Fritz) (Frizzled-related protein 1) (FrzB-1)
GeneName	FRZB FIZ FRE FRP FRZB1 SFRP3
Length	325
Function	Soluble frizzled-related proteins (sFRPS) function as modulators of Wnt signaling through direct interaction with Wnts. They have a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation in specific cell types. SFRP3/FRZB appears to be involved in limb skeletogenesis. Antagonist of Wnt8 signaling. Regulates chondrocyte maturation and long bone development.
