ProteinName	Growth/differentiation factor 6 (GDF-6) (Bone morphogenetic protein 13) (BMP-13) (Growth/differentiation factor 16)
GeneName	GDF6 BMP13 GDF16
Length	455
Function	Growth factor that controls proliferation and cellular differentiation in the retina and bone formation. Plays a key role in regulating apoptosis during retinal development. Establishes dorsal-ventral positional information in the retina and controls the formation of the retinotectal map (PubMed:23307924). Required for normal formation of bones and joints in the limbs, skull, digits and axial skeleton. Plays a key role in establishing boundaries between skeletal elements during development. Regulation of GDF6 expression seems to be a mechanism for evolving species-specific changes in skeletal structures. Seems to positively regulate differentiation of chondrogenic tissue through the growth factor receptors subunits BMPR1A, BMPR1B, BMPR2 and ACVR2A, leading to the activation of SMAD1-SMAD5-SMAD8 complex. The regulation of chondrogenic differentiation is inhibited by NOG (PubMed:26643732). Also involved in the induction of adipogenesis from mesenchymal stem cells. This mechanism acts through the growth factor receptors subunits BMPR1A, BMPR2 and ACVR2A and the activation of SMAD1-SMAD5-SMAD8 complex and MAPK14/p38 (By similarity).
