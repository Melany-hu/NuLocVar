UniprotID	Q8TAA3-2
Accession	Q8TAA3;B0YJ75;Q8IVP4;Q8TA98;Q8TAA2
EntryName	PSMA8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteasome subunit alpha-type 8 (Proteasome alpha 4 subunit) (Alpha4s) (Proteasome subunit alpha-type 7-like)
GeneName	PSMA8 PSMA7L
Length	212
Function	Component of the spermatoproteasome, a proteasome specifically found in testis that promotes acetylation-dependent degradation of histones, thereby participating actively to the exchange of histones during spermatogenesis. The proteasome is a protein complex that degrades unneeded or damaged proteins by proteolysis, a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds. Required for 20S core proteasome assembly, essential for the degradation of meiotic proteins RAD51 and RPA1 at late prophase I and the progression of meiosis I during spermatogenesis. Localizes to the synaptonemal complex, a 'zipper'-like structure that holds homologous chromosome pairs in synapsis during meiotic prophase I.
