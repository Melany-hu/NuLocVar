UniprotID	Q96KN8
Accession	Q96KN8;B7X6T1;F5GZ87;F5H4Y9
EntryName	PLAT5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholipase A and acyltransferase 5 (Ca(2+)-independent N-acyltransferase) (iNAT) (EC 2.3.1.-, EC 3.1.1.32, EC 3.1.1.4) (H-rev107-like protein 5) (HRAS-like suppressor 5) (HRSL5)
GeneName	PLAAT5 HRASLS5 HRLP5
Length	279
Function	Exhibits both phospholipase A1/2 and acyltransferase activities (PubMed:22825852, PubMed:26503625). Shows phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and A2 (PLA2) activity, catalyzing the calcium-independent release of fatty acids from the sn-1 or sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids (PubMed:22825852). Shows N-acyltransferase activity, catalyzing the calcium-independent transfer of a fatty acyl group at the sn-1 position of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and other glycerophospholipids to the primary amine of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), forming N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE), which serves as precursor for N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) (PubMed:19000777, PubMed:22825852).
