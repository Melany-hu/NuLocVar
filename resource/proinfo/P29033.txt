EntryName	CXB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gap junction beta-2 protein (Connexin-26) (Cx26)
GeneName	GJB2
Length	226
Function	Structural component of gap junctions (PubMed:16849369, PubMed:17551008, PubMed:19340074, PubMed:19384972, PubMed:21094651, PubMed:26753910). Gap junctions are dodecameric channels that connect the cytoplasm of adjoining cells. They are formed by the docking of two hexameric hemichannels, one from each cell membrane (PubMed:17551008, PubMed:19340074, PubMed:21094651, PubMed:26753910). Small molecules and ions diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell via the central pore (PubMed:16849369, PubMed:19384972, PubMed:21094651).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell junction; Gap junction
