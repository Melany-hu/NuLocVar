EntryName	AP2C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor AP-2 gamma (AP2-gamma) (Activating enhancer-binding protein 2 gamma) (Transcription factor ERF-1)
GeneName	TFAP2C
Length	450
Function	Sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor that interacts with cellular enhancer elements to regulate transcription of selected genes, and which plays a key role in early embryonic development (PubMed:11694877, PubMed:24413532). AP-2 factors bind to the consensus sequence 5'-GCCNNNGGC-3' and activate genes involved in a large spectrum of important biological functions (PubMed:11694877, PubMed:24413532). TFAP2C plays a key role in early embryonic development by regulating both inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm differentiation (By similarity). At the 8-cell stage, during morula development, controls expression of cell-polarity genes (By similarity). Upon trophoblast commitment, binds to late trophectoderm genes in blastocysts together with CDX2, and later to extra-embryonic ectoderm genes together with SOX2 (By similarity). Binds to both closed and open chromatin with other transcription factors (By similarity). Involved in the MTA1-mediated epigenetic regulation of ESR1 expression in breast cancer (PubMed:24413532).
