UniprotID	P16520
Accession	P16520;Q96B71;Q9BQC0
EntryName	GBB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(T) subunit beta-3 (Transducin beta chain 3)
GeneName	GNB3
Length	340
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
