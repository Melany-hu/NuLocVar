UniprotID	O95050
Accession	O95050;B8ZZ69;Q3KP49;Q9P1Y2;Q9UBY4;Q9UHQ0
EntryName	INMT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (Indolamine N-methyltransferase) (EC 2.1.1.49) (EC 2.1.1.96) (Aromatic alkylamine N-methyltransferase) (Amine N-methyltransferase) (Arylamine N-methyltransferase) (Thioether S-methyltransferase) (TEMT)
GeneName	INMT
Length	263
Function	Functions as a thioether S-methyltransferase and is active with a variety of thioethers and the corresponding selenium and tellurium compounds, including 3-methylthiopropionaldehyde, dimethyl selenide, dimethyl telluride, 2-methylthioethylamine, 2-methylthioethanol, methyl-n-propyl sulfide and diethyl sulfide. Plays an important role in the detoxification of selenium compounds (By similarity). Catalyzes the N-methylation of tryptamine and structurally related compounds.
