Length	496
Function	Transforming growth factor-beta superfamily receptors signaling occurs through the Smad family of intracellular mediators. SMAD6 is an inhibitory Smad (i-Smad) that negatively regulates signaling downstream of type I transforming growth factor-beta (PubMed:10647776, PubMed:10708948, PubMed:10708949, PubMed:16951688, PubMed:22275001, PubMed:30848080, PubMed:9436979, PubMed:9759503). Acts as a mediator of TGF-beta and BMP anti-inflammatory activities. Suppresses IL1R-TLR signaling through its direct interaction with PEL1, preventing NF-kappa-B activation, nuclear transport and NF-kappa-B-mediated expression of pro-inflammatory genes (PubMed:16951688). Blocks the BMP-SMAD1 signaling pathway by competing with SMAD4 for receptor-activated SMAD1-binding (PubMed:30848080, PubMed:9436979). Binds to regulatory elements in target promoter regions (PubMed:16491121).
