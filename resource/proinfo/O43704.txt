UniprotID	O43704
Accession	O43704;O15497;Q96FI1;Q9UK34
EntryName	ST1B1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sulfotransferase 1B1 (ST1B1) (EC 2.8.2.1) (Sulfotransferase 1B2) (Sulfotransferase family cytosolic 1B member 1) (Thyroid hormone sulfotransferase)
GeneName	SULT1B1 ST1B2 SULT1B2
Length	296
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) as sulfonate donor to catalyze the sulfate conjugation of dopamine, small phenols such as 1-naphthol and p-nitrophenol and thyroid hormones, including 3,3'-diiodothyronine, triidothyronine (T3) and reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) (PubMed:28084139, PubMed:9443824, PubMed:9463486). May play a role in gut microbiota-host metabolic interaction. O-sulfonates 4-ethylphenol (4-EP), a dietary tyrosine-derived metabolite produced by gut bacteria. The product 4-EPS crosses the blood-brain barrier and may negatively regulate oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, affecting the functional connectivity of different brain regions associated with the limbic system (PubMed:35165440).
