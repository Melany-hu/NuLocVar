UniprotID	P83110
Accession	P83110;Q7Z7A2
EntryName	HTRA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine protease HTRA3 (EC 3.4.21.-) (High-temperature requirement factor A3) (Pregnancy-related serine protease)
GeneName	HTRA3 PRSP
Length	453
Function	Serine protease that cleaves beta-casein/CSN2 as well as several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycans such as decorin/DCN, biglycan/BGN and fibronectin/FN1. Inhibits signaling mediated by TGF-beta family proteins possibly indirectly by degradation of these ECM proteoglycans (By similarity). May act as a tumor suppressor. Negatively regulates, in vitro, trophoblast invasion during placental development and may be involved in the development of the placenta in vivo. May also have a role in ovarian development, granulosa cell differentiation and luteinization (PubMed:21321049, PubMed:22229724).
