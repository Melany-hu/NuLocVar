Function	Transcriptional coregulator which can act as both a transcriptional corepressor and coactivator (PubMed:16617102, PubMed:17671180, PubMed:17922032, PubMed:21965678, PubMed:24413532). Acts as a component of the histone deacetylase NuRD complex which participates in the remodeling of chromatin (PubMed:16428440, PubMed:28977666). In the NuRD complex, regulates transcription of its targets by modifying the acetylation status of the target chromatin and cofactor accessibility to the target DNA (PubMed:17671180). In conjunction with other components of NuRD, acts as a transcriptional corepressor of BRCA1, ESR1, TFF1 and CDKN1A (PubMed:17922032, PubMed:24413532). Acts as a transcriptional coactivator of BCAS3, and SUMO2, independent of the NuRD complex (PubMed:16617102, PubMed:17671180, PubMed:21965678). Stimulates the expression of WNT1 by inhibiting the expression of its transcriptional corepressor SIX3 (By similarity). Regulates p53-dependent and -independent DNA repair processes following genotoxic stress (PubMed:19837670). Regulates the stability and function of p53/TP53 by inhibiting its ubiquitination by COP1 and MDM2 thereby regulating the p53-dependent DNA repair (PubMed:19837670). Plays a role in the regulation of the circadian clock and is essential for the generation and maintenance of circadian rhythms under constant light and for normal entrainment of behavior to light-dark (LD) cycles (By similarity). Positively regulates the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer mediated transcriptional activation of its own transcription and the transcription of CRY1 (By similarity). Regulates deacetylation of BMAL1 by regulating SIRT1 expression, resulting in derepressing CRY1-mediated transcription repression (By similarity). With TFCP2L1, promotes establishment and maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and inhibits endoderm differentiation (By similarity).
