UniprotID	Q969T9
Accession	Q969T9;B4DFG2;O95638
EntryName	WBP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	WW domain-binding protein 2 (WBP-2)
GeneName	WBP2
Length	261
Function	Acts as a transcriptional coactivator of estrogen and progesterone receptors (ESR1 and PGR) upon hormone activation (PubMed:16772533). In presence of estrogen, binds to ESR1-responsive promoters (PubMed:16772533). Synergizes with YAP1 to enhance PGR activity (PubMed:16772533). Modulates expression of post-synaptic scaffolding proteins via regulation of ESR1, ESR2 and PGR (By similarity).
