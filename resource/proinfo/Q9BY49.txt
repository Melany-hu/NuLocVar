EntryName	PECR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisomal trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (TERP) (EC 1.3.1.38) (2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase-related protein) (DCR-RP) (HPDHase) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 29C member 1) (pVI-ARL)
GeneName	PECR SDR29C1 PRO1004
Length	303
Function	Participates in chain elongation of fatty acids. Catalyzes the reduction of trans-2-enoyl-CoAs of varying chain lengths from 6:1 to 16:1, having maximum activity with 10:1 CoA. Has no 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase activity.
