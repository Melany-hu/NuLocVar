UniprotID	P41238
Accession	P41238;Q9UE64;Q9UM71
EntryName	ABEC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	C->U-editing enzyme APOBEC-1 (EC 3.5.4.-) (Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 1) (APO1) (APOBEC-1) (Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme 1) (EC 3.5.4.36) (HEPR) (mRNA(cytosine(6666)) deaminase 1)
GeneName	APOBEC1
Length	236
Function	Cytidine deaminase catalyzing the cytidine to uridine postranscriptional editing of a variety of mRNAs (PubMed:30844405). Form complexes with cofactors that confer differential editing activity and selectivity. Responsible for the postranscriptional editing of a CAA codon for Gln to a UAA codon for stop in the apolipoprotein B mRNA (PubMed:24916387). Also involved in CGA (Arg) to UGA (Stop) editing in the NF1 mRNA (PubMed:11727199). May also play a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by participating in DNA demethylation (By similarity).
