UniprotID	P56373
Accession	P56373;Q6DK37;Q9UQB6
EntryName	P2RX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	P2X purinoceptor 3 (P2X3) (ATP receptor) (Purinergic receptor)
GeneName	P2RX3
Length	397
Function	Extracellular ATP-activated non-selective cation channel (PubMed:10440098, PubMed:27626375, PubMed:29674445, PubMed:31232692). Plays particularly important role in sensory neurons where its activation is critical for gustatory, nociceptive responses, visceral reflexes and sensory hypersensitization (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
