UniprotID	Q96A58
Accession	Q96A58;B2R9R0;B4DI02
EntryName	RERG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related and estrogen-regulated growth inhibitor (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RERG
Length	199
Function	Binds GDP/GTP and possesses intrinsic GTPase activity. Has higher affinity for GDP than for GTP. In cell lines overexpression leads to a reduction in the rate of proliferation, colony formation and in tumorigenic potential.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
