UniprotID	A0A096LP55
Accession	A0A096LP55
EntryName	QCR6L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 6-like, mitochondrial
GeneName	UQCRHL
Length	91
Function	May be a component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex), which is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein may mediate formation of the complex between cytochromes c and c1.
