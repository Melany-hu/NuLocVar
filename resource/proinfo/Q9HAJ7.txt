UniprotID	Q9HAJ7
Accession	Q9HAJ7;E9PAU7;E9PAY2
EntryName	SP30L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone deacetylase complex subunit SAP30L (HCV non-structural protein 4A-transactivated protein 2) (Sin3 corepressor complex subunit SAP30L) (Sin3-associated protein p30-like)
GeneName	SAP30L NS4ATP2
Length	183
Function	Functions as a transcription repressor, probably via its interaction with histone deacetylase complexes (PubMed:16820529, PubMed:18070604). Involved in the functional recruitment of the class 1 Sin3-histone deacetylase complex (HDAC) to the nucleolus (PubMed:16820529). Binds DNA, apparently without sequence-specificity, and bends bound double-stranded DNA (PubMed:19015240). Binds phosphoinositol phosphates (phosphoinositol 3-phosphate, phosphoinositol 4-phosphate and phosphoinositol 5-phosphate) via the same basic sequence motif that mediates DNA binding and nuclear import (PubMed:19015240, PubMed:26609676).
