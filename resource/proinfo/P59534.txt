UniprotID	P59534
Accession	P59534;A4FUI7;Q3ZCN6;Q645W4
EntryName	T2R39_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 39 (T2R39) (Taste receptor type 2 member 57) (T2R57)
GeneName	TAS2R39
Length	338
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5 (By similarity).
