UniprotID	P04818
Accession	P04818;Q8WYK3;Q8WYK4
EntryName	TYSY_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thymidylate synthase (TS) (TSase) (EC 2.1.1.45)
GeneName	TYMS TS OK/SW-cl.29
Length	313
Function	Catalyzes the reductive methylation of 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (dUMP) to thymidine 5'-monophosphate (dTMP), using the cosubstrate, 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2H4folate) as a 1-carbon donor and reductant and contributes to the de novo mitochondrial thymidylate biosynthesis pathway.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Mitochondrion; Mitochondrion matrix; Mitochondrion inner membrane
