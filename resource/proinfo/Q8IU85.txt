UniprotID	Q8IU85
Accession	Q8IU85;B0YIY0;Q9HD31
EntryName	KCC1D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type 1D (EC 2.7.11.17) (CaM kinase I delta) (CaM kinase ID) (CaM-KI delta) (CaMKI delta) (CaMKID) (CaMKI-like protein kinase) (CKLiK)
GeneName	CAMK1D CAMKID
Length	385
Function	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase that operates in the calcium-triggered CaMKK-CaMK1 signaling cascade and, upon calcium influx, activates CREB-dependent gene transcription, regulates calcium-mediated granulocyte function and respiratory burst and promotes basal dendritic growth of hippocampal neurons. In neutrophil cells, required for cytokine-induced proliferative responses and activation of the respiratory burst. Activates the transcription factor CREB1 in hippocampal neuron nuclei. May play a role in apoptosis of erythroleukemia cells. In vitro, phosphorylates transcription factor CREM isoform Beta.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus
