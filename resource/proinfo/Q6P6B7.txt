UniprotID	Q6P6B7
Accession	Q6P6B7;A6NEF0;F8WEI4;Q9NT01
EntryName	ANR16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 16
GeneName	ANKRD16
Length	361
Function	Required to prevent the misactivation of serine (Ser) with tRNA(Ala) by promoting the hydrolysis of Ser-mischarged tRNA(Ala), thereby playing a role in translational fidelity. Binds directly to the catalytic domain of AARS/AlaRS and captures Ser that is misactivated by AARS/AlaRS, preventing the charging of Ser adenylates to tRNA(Ala) and precluding Ser misincorporation in nascent peptides.
