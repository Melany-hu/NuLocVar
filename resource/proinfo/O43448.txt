UniprotID	O43448
Accession	O43448;Q4VAW0
EntryName	KCAB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit beta-3 (EC 1.1.1.-) (K(+) channel subunit beta-3) (Kv-beta-3)
GeneName	KCNAB3 KCNA3B
Length	404
Function	Regulatory subunit of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels composed of pore-forming and potassium-conducting alpha subunits and of regulatory beta subunit (PubMed:9857044). The beta-3/KCNAB3 subunit may mediate closure of potassium channels (By similarity). Increases inactivation of Kv1.5/KCNA5 alpha subunit-containing channels (PubMed:9857044). May display nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent aldoketoreductase activity (By similarity). The binding of oxidized and reduced NADP(H) cofactors may be required for the regulation of potassium channel activity (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
