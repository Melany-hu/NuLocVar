UniprotID	P49716
Accession	P49716;Q14937;Q2M2X9
EntryName	CEBPD_HUMAN
ProteinName	CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein delta (C/EBP delta) (Nuclear factor NF-IL6-beta) (NF-IL6-beta)
GeneName	CEBPD
Length	269
Function	Transcription activator that recognizes two different DNA motifs: the CCAAT homology common to many promoters and the enhanced core homology common to many enhancers (PubMed:16397300). Important transcription factor regulating the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (PubMed:16397300, PubMed:1741402). Transcriptional activator that enhances IL6 transcription alone and as heterodimer with CEBPB (PubMed:1741402).
