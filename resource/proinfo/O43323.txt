UniprotID	O43323
Accession	O43323;Q15794
EntryName	DHH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Desert hedgehog protein (DHH) (EC 3.1.-.-) (HHG-3) [Cleaved into: Desert hedgehog protein N-product (DHH-N)]
GeneName	DHH
Length	396
Function	The C-terminal part of the desert hedgehog protein precursor displays an autoproteolysis and a cholesterol transferase activity (By similarity). Both activities result in the cleavage of the full-length protein into two parts (N-product and C-product) followed by the covalent attachment of a cholesterol moiety to the C-terminal of the newly generated N-product (By similarity). Both activities occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (By similarity). Functions in cell-cell mediated juxtacrine signaling (PubMed:24342078). Promotes endothelium integrity (PubMed:33063110). Binds to PTCH1 receptor, which functions in association with smoothened (SMO), to activate the transcription of target genes in endothelial cells (PubMed:33063110). In Schwann cells, controls the development of the peripheral nerve sheath and the transition of mesenchymal cells to form the epithelium-like structure of the perineurial tube (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Secreted; Cell membrane
