UniprotID	P62879
Accession	P62879;B3KPU1;P11016;P54312
EntryName	GBB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(T) subunit beta-2 (G protein subunit beta-2) (Transducin beta chain 2)
GeneName	GNB2
Length	340
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region; Cell membrane
