UniprotID	Q17RH7
Accession	Q17RH7;Q8NAM5
EntryName	TPRXL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tetra-peptide repeat homeobox-like protein
GeneName	TPRXL
Length	139
Function	Transcription factor required for zygotic genome activation (ZGA), a critical event in early embryonic development during which the developmental control passes from maternally provided mRNAs to the expression of the zygotic genome after fertilization (PubMed:36074823). Protein produced from maternal transcripts that binds and activates expression of key ZGA marker genes, such as NANOGNB, ZSCAN4, DUXB, KLF5 and DPPA3 (PubMed:36074823). Binds to regulatory DNA sequences containing a 5'-TAATCC-3' sequence motif (By similarity).
