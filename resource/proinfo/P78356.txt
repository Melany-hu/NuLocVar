ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase type-2 beta (EC 2.7.1.149) (1-phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase 2-beta) (Diphosphoinositide kinase 2-beta) (Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase type II beta) (PI(5)P 4-kinase type II beta) (PIP4KII-beta) (PtdIns(5)P-4-kinase isoform 2-beta)
GeneName	PIP4K2B PIP5K2B
Length	416
Function	Participates in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PubMed:26774281, PubMed:9038203). Preferentially utilizes GTP, rather than ATP, for PI(5)P phosphorylation and its activity reflects changes in direct proportion to the physiological GTP concentration (PubMed:26774281). Its GTP-sensing activity is critical for metabolic adaptation (PubMed:26774281). PIP4Ks negatively regulate insulin signaling through a catalytic-independent mechanism. They interact with PIP5Ks and suppress PIP5K-mediated PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis and insulin-dependent conversion to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PubMed:31091439).
