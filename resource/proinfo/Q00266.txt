UniprotID	Q00266
Accession	Q00266;D3DWD5;Q5QP09
EntryName	METK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	S-adenosylmethionine synthase isoform type-1 (AdoMet synthase 1) (EC 2.5.1.6) (Methionine adenosyltransferase 1) (MAT 1) (Methionine adenosyltransferase I/III) (MAT-I/III)
GeneName	MAT1A AMS1 MATA1
Length	395
Function	Catalyzes the formation of S-adenosylmethionine from methionine and ATP. The reaction comprises two steps that are both catalyzed by the same enzyme: formation of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and triphosphate, and subsequent hydrolysis of the triphosphate.
