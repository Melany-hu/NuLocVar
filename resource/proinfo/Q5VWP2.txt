UniprotID	Q5VWP2
Accession	Q5VWP2;A3KMG2;Q8NE25;Q9NXK0
EntryName	TET5C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Terminal nucleotidyltransferase 5C (EC 2.7.7.19) (Non-canonical poly(A) polymerase FAM46C)
GeneName	TENT5C FAM46C
Length	391
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of one adenosine molecule from an ATP to an mRNA poly(A) tail bearing a 3'-OH terminal group and enhances mRNA stability and gene expression (PubMed:28931820, PubMed:32009146, PubMed:34048638). Can also elongate RNA oligos ending with uridine molecule, provided that the sequence is adenosine-rich (PubMed:34048638). Mainly targets mRNAs encoding endoplasmic reticulum-targeted protein (PubMed:28931820).
