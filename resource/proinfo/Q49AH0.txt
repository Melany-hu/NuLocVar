UniprotID	Q49AH0
Accession	Q49AH0;A2RUU0;B4DVW3
EntryName	CDNF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (ARMET-like protein 1) (Conserved dopamine neurotrophic factor)
GeneName	CDNF ARMETL1
Length	187
Function	Trophic factor for dopamine neurons. Prevents the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. When administered after 6-OHDA-lesioning, restores the dopaminergic function and prevents the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra (By similarity).
