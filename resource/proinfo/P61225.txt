UniprotID	P61225
Accession	P61225;P17964;Q96EG5;Q9CXG0
EntryName	RAP2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rap-2b (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAP2B
Length	183
Function	Small GTP-binding protein which cycles between a GDP-bound inactive and a GTP-bound active form. Involved in EGFR and CHRM3 signaling pathways through stimulation of PLCE1. May play a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements and regulate cell spreading through activation of the effector TNIK. May regulate membrane vesiculation in red blood cells.
Subcellular Location	Recycling endosome membrane
