UniprotID	Q5JTJ3
Accession	Q5JTJ3;Q5JTJ2;Q5JTJ4;Q8TA88
EntryName	COA6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 6 homolog
GeneName	COA6 C1orf31
Length	125
Function	Involved in the maturation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV subunit MT-CO2/COX2. Thereby, may regulate early steps of complex IV assembly. Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV or cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from intermembrane space cytochrome c to molecular oxygen in the matrix and as a consequence contributes to the proton gradient involved in mitochondrial ATP synthesis. May also be required for efficient formation of respiratory supercomplexes comprised of complexes III and IV.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion intermembrane space
