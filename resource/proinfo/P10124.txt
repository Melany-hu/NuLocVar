UniprotID	P10124
Accession	P10124;B2R4L7;Q5VW06
EntryName	SRGN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serglycin (Hematopoietic proteoglycan core protein) (Platelet proteoglycan core protein) (P.PG) (Secretory granule proteoglycan core protein)
GeneName	SRGN PRG PRG1
Length	158
Function	Plays a role in formation of mast cell secretory granules and mediates storage of various compounds in secretory vesicles. Required for storage of some proteases in both connective tissue and mucosal mast cells and for storage of granzyme B in T-lymphocytes. Plays a role in localizing neutrophil elastase in azurophil granules of neutrophils. Mediates processing of MMP2. Plays a role in cytotoxic cell granule-mediated apoptosis by forming a complex with granzyme B which is delivered to cells by perforin to induce apoptosis. Regulates the secretion of TNF-alpha and may also regulate protease secretion. Inhibits bone mineralization.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic granule; Cytolytic granule; Secreted; Extracellular space; Golgi apparatus
