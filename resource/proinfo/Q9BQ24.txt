UniprotID	Q9BQ24
Accession	Q9BQ24;A8K3A4;Q86T05;Q96LT1
EntryName	ZFY21_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger FYVE domain-containing protein 21 (ZF21)
GeneName	ZFYVE21
Length	234
Function	Plays a role in cell adhesion, and thereby in cell motility which requires repeated formation and disassembly of focal adhesions. Regulates microtubule-induced PTK2/FAK1 dephosphorylation, an event important for focal adhesion disassembly, as well as integrin beta-1/ITGB1 cell surface expression.
Subcellular Location	Cell junction; Focal adhesion; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Endosome
