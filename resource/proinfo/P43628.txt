UniprotID	P43628
Accession	P43628;O43472;P78402;Q14944;Q14945;Q9UM51;Q9UQ70
EntryName	KI2L3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 2DL3 (CD158 antigen-like family member B2) (KIR-023GB) (Killer inhibitory receptor cl 2-3) (NKAT2a) (NKAT2b) (Natural killer-associated transcript 2) (NKAT-2) (p58 natural killer cell receptor clone CL-6) (p58 NK receptor CL-6) (p58.2 MHC class-I-specific NK receptor) (CD antigen CD158b2)
GeneName	KIR2DL3 CD158B2 KIRCL23 NKAT2
Length	341
Function	Receptor on natural killer (NK) cells for HLA-C alleles (HLA-Cw1, HLA-Cw3 and HLA-Cw7). Inhibits the activity of NK cells thus preventing cell lysis.
