UniprotID	P0C5Y4
Accession	P0C5Y4;A6NJ92
EntryName	KRA14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 1-4 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 1.4) (Keratin-associated protein 1.4)
GeneName	KRTAP1-4 KAP1.4 KRTAP1.4
Length	121
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
