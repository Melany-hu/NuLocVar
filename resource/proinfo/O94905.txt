EntryName	ERLN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Erlin-2 (Endoplasmic reticulum lipid raft-associated protein 2) (Stomatin-prohibitin-flotillin-HflC/K domain-containing protein 2) (SPFH domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	ERLIN2 C8orf2 SPFH2 UNQ2441/PRO5003/PRO9924
Length	339
Function	Component of the ERLIN1/ERLIN2 complex which mediates the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) such as ITPR1 (PubMed:17502376, PubMed:19240031). Promotes sterol-accelerated ERAD of HMGCR probably implicating an AMFR/gp78-containing ubiquitin ligase complex (PubMed:21343306). Involved in regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis by regulation the SREBP signaling pathway. May promote ER retention of the SCAP-SREBF complex (PubMed:24217618).
