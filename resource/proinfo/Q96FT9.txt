EntryName	IFT43_HUMAN
ProteinName	Intraflagellar transport protein 43 homolog
GeneName	IFT43 C14orf179
Length	208
Function	As a component of IFT complex A (IFT-A), a complex required for retrograde ciliary transport and entry into cilia of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), it is involved in ciliogenesis (PubMed:28400947, PubMed:28973684). Involved in retrograde ciliary transport along microtubules from the ciliary tip to the base (PubMed:21378380).
