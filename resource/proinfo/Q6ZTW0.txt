UniprotID	Q6ZTW0
Accession	Q6ZTW0;Q96GE2
EntryName	TPGS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tubulin polyglutamylase complex subunit 1 (PGs1)
GeneName	TPGS1 C19orf20
Length	290
Function	Subunit of the tubulin polyglutamylase complex (TPGC). The complex mediates cilia and flagella polyglutamylation which is essential for their biogenesis and motility (Probable). May act in the targeting of the tubulin polyglutamylase complex. Required for the development of the spermatid flagellum (By similarity).
