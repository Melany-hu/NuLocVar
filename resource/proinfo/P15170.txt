UniprotID	P15170
Accession	P15170;J3KQG6;Q96GF2
EntryName	ERF3A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic peptide chain release factor GTP-binding subunit ERF3A (Eukaryotic peptide chain release factor subunit 3a) (eRF3a) (EC 3.6.5.-) (G1 to S phase transition protein 1 homolog)
GeneName	GSPT1 ERF3A
Length	499
Function	GTPase component of the eRF1-eRF3-GTP ternary complex, a ternary complex that mediates translation termination in response to the termination codons UAA, UAG and UGA (PubMed:15987998, PubMed:19417105, PubMed:2511002, PubMed:27863242). GSPT1/ERF3A mediates ETF1/ERF1 delivery to stop codons: The eRF1-eRF3-GTP complex binds to a stop codon in the ribosomal A-site (PubMed:27863242). GTP hydrolysis by GSPT1/ERF3A induces a conformational change that leads to its dissociation, permitting ETF1/ERF1 to accommodate fully in the A-site (PubMed:16777602, PubMed:27863242). Component of the transient SURF complex which recruits UPF1 to stalled ribosomes in the context of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mRNAs containing premature stop codons (PubMed:24486019). Required for SHFL-mediated translation termination which inhibits programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1PRF) of mRNA from viruses and cellular genes (PubMed:30682371).
