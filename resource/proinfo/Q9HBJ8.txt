UniprotID	Q9HBJ8
Accession	Q9HBJ8;B2R9M1;Q6UW07
EntryName	CLTRN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Collectrin (Transmembrane protein 27)
GeneName	CLTRN TMEM27 UNQ679/PRO1312
Length	222
Function	Plays an important role in amino acid transport by acting as binding partner of amino acid transporters SLC6A18 and SLC6A19, regulating their trafficking on the cell surface and their amino acid transporter activity (By similarity). May also play a role in trafficking of amino acid transporters SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 to the renal cortical cell membrane (By similarity). Regulator of SNARE complex function (PubMed:16330323). Stimulator of beta cell replication (PubMed:16330323).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
