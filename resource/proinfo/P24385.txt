UniprotID	P24385
Accession	P24385;Q6LEF0
EntryName	CCND1_HUMAN
ProteinName	G1/S-specific cyclin-D1 (B-cell lymphoma 1 protein) (BCL-1) (BCL-1 oncogene) (PRAD1 oncogene)
GeneName	CCND1 BCL1 PRAD1
Length	295
Function	Regulatory component of the cyclin D1-CDK4 (DC) complex that phosphorylates and inhibits members of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family including RB1 and regulates the cell-cycle during G(1)/S transition (PubMed:1827756, PubMed:1833066, PubMed:19412162, PubMed:33854235, PubMed:8114739, PubMed:8302605). Phosphorylation of RB1 allows dissociation of the transcription factor E2F from the RB/E2F complex and the subsequent transcription of E2F target genes which are responsible for the progression through the G(1) phase (PubMed:1827756, PubMed:1833066, PubMed:19412162, PubMed:8114739, PubMed:8302605). Hypophosphorylates RB1 in early G(1) phase (PubMed:1827756, PubMed:1833066, PubMed:19412162, PubMed:8114739, PubMed:8302605). Cyclin D-CDK4 complexes are major integrators of various mitogenenic and antimitogenic signals (PubMed:1827756, PubMed:1833066, PubMed:19412162, PubMed:8302605). Also a substrate for SMAD3, phosphorylating SMAD3 in a cell-cycle-dependent manner and repressing its transcriptional activity (PubMed:15241418). Component of the ternary complex, cyclin D1/CDK4/CDKN1B, required for nuclear translocation and activity of the cyclin D-CDK4 complex (PubMed:9106657). Exhibits transcriptional corepressor activity with INSM1 on the NEUROD1 and INS promoters in a cell cycle-independent manner (PubMed:16569215, PubMed:18417529).
