UniprotID	Q9P0S2
Accession	Q9P0S2;A6NDT5;A8K3X8;B8XYC5
EntryName	COX16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein COX16 homolog, mitochondrial (hCOX16)
GeneName	COX16 C14orf112 HSPC203 PTD019
Length	106
Function	Required for the assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (CIV), also known as cytochrome c oxidase (PubMed:29355485, PubMed:29381136, PubMed:33169484). Promotes the insertion of copper into the active site of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (MT-CO2/COX2) (PubMed:29355485, PubMed:29381136). Interacts specifically with newly synthesized MT-CO2/COX and its copper center-forming metallochaperones SCO1, SCO2 and COA6 (PubMed:29381136). Probably facilitates MT-CO2/COX2 association with the MITRAC assembly intermediate containing MT-CO1/COX1, thereby participating in merging the MT-CO1/COX1 and MT-CO2/COX2 assembly lines (PubMed:29381136).
