UniprotID	Q14847
Accession	Q14847;B4DGQ0;Q96ED2;Q96IG0
EntryName	LASP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	LIM and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP-1) (Metastatic lymph node gene 50 protein) (MLN 50)
GeneName	LASP1 MLN50
Length	261
Function	Plays an important role in the regulation of dynamic actin-based, cytoskeletal activities. Agonist-dependent changes in LASP1 phosphorylation may also serve to regulate actin-associated ion transport activities, not only in the parietal cell but also in certain other F-actin-rich secretory epithelial cell types (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cell cortex; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
