UniprotID	P04899
Accession	P04899;B3KTZ0;B4DYA0;B4E2X5;Q6B6N3;Q8IZ71
EntryName	GNAI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit alpha-2 (Adenylate cyclase-inhibiting G alpha protein)
GeneName	GNAI2 GNAI2B
Length	355
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as modulators or transducers in various transmembrane signaling systems. The G(i) proteins are involved in hormonal regulation of adenylate cyclase: they inhibit the cyclase in response to beta-adrenergic stimuli. May play a role in cell division.
