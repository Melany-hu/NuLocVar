Accession	Q15007;Q5TCL8;Q5TCL9;Q96T28;Q9BYJ7;Q9H4E2
EntryName	FL2D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pre-mRNA-splicing regulator WTAP (Female-lethal(2)D homolog) (hFL(2)D) (WT1-associated protein) (Wilms tumor 1-associating protein)
GeneName	WTAP KIAA0105
Length	396
Function	Associated component of the WMM complex, a complex that mediates N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation of RNAs, a modification that plays a role in the efficiency of mRNA splicing and RNA processing (PubMed:29507755). Required for accumulation of METTL3 and METTL14 to nuclear speckle (PubMed:24316715, PubMed:24407421, PubMed:24981863). Acts as a mRNA splicing regulator (PubMed:12444081). Regulates G2/M cell-cycle transition by binding to the 3' UTR of CCNA2, which enhances its stability (PubMed:17088532). Impairs WT1 DNA-binding ability and inhibits expression of WT1 target genes (PubMed:17095724).
