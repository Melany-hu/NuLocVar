UniprotID	P02818
Accession	P02818;Q5TCK6
EntryName	OSTCN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Osteocalcin (Bone Gla protein) (BGP) (Gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein)
GeneName	BGLAP
Length	100
Function	Bone protein that constitutes 1-2% of the total bone protein, and which acts as a negative regulator of bone formation (PubMed:3019668, PubMed:6967872). Functions to limit bone formation without impairing bone resorption or mineralization (By similarity). It binds strongly to apatite and calcium (PubMed:6967872).
