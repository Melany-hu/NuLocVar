EntryName	RRFM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosome-recycling factor, mitochondrial (RRF) (mtRRF) (Ribosome-releasing factor, mitochondrial)
GeneName	MRRF
Length	262
Function	Responsible for the disassembly of ribosomes from messenger RNA at the termination of mitochondrial protein biosynthesis (PubMed:19716793, PubMed:33878294).
