Accession	Q8N4T8;Q8WTW8;Q96K93
EntryName	CBR4_HUMAN
ProteinName	3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (EC 1.1.1.100) (3-ketoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase beta subunit) (KAR beta subunit) (Carbonyl reductase family member 4) (CBR4) (Quinone reductase CBR4) (EC 1.6.5.10) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 45C member 1)
GeneName	CBR4 SDR45C1
Length	237
Function	Component of the heterotetramer complex KAR (3-ketoacyl- reductase or 3-ketoacyl- reductase) that forms part of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthase (mtFAS). Beta-subunit of the KAR heterotetramer complex, responsible for the 3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase activity of the mtFAS, reduces 3-oxoacyl- to (3R)-hydroxyacyl- in a NADPH-dependent manner with no chain length preference, thereby participating in mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis (PubMed:25203508). The homotetramer has NADPH-dependent quinone reductase activity (in vitro), hence could play a role in protection against cytotoxicity of exogenous quinones (PubMed:19000905). As a heterotetramer, it can also reduce 9,10-phenanthrenequinone, 1,4-benzoquinone and various other o-quinones and p-quinones (in vitro) (PubMed:19000905, PubMed:19571038, PubMed:25203508).
