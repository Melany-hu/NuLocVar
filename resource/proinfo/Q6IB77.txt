UniprotID	Q6IB77
Accession	Q6IB77;H1AE11;O14833;Q96QK7
EntryName	GLYAT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycine N-acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.13) (Acyl-CoA:glycine N-acyltransferase) (AAc) (Aralkyl acyl-CoA N-acyltransferase) (Aralkyl acyl-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase) (Benzoyl-coenzyme A:glycine N-acyltransferase) (Glycine N-benzoyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.71) (HRP-1(CLP))
GeneName	GLYAT ACGNAT CAT GAT
Length	296
Function	Mitochondrial acyltransferase which transfers an acyl group to the N-terminus of glycine and glutamine, although much less efficiently. Can conjugate numerous substrates to form a variety of N-acylglycines, with a preference for benzoyl-CoA over phenylacetyl-CoA as acyl donors. Thereby detoxify xenobiotics, such as benzoic acid or salicylic acid, and endogenous organic acids, such as isovaleric acid.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
