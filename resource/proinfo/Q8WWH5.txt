ProteinName	Pseudouridylate synthase TRUB1 (EC 5.4.99.-) (TruB pseudouridine synthase homolog 1) (tRNA pseudouridine 55 synthase TRUB1) (Psi55 synthase TRUB1) (EC 5.4.99.25)
GeneName	TRUB1 PUS4
Length	349
Function	Pseudouridine synthase that catalyzes pseudouridylation of mRNAs and tRNAs (PubMed:28073919, PubMed:31477916, PubMed:32926445). Mediates pseudouridylation of mRNAs with the consensus sequence 5'-GUUCNANNC-3', harboring a stem-loop structure (PubMed:28073919, PubMed:31477916). Constitutes the major pseudouridine synthase acting on mRNAs (PubMed:28073919). Also catalyzes pseudouridylation of some tRNAs, including synthesis of pseudouridine(55) from uracil-55, in the psi GC loop of a subset of tRNAs (PubMed:32926445, PubMed:33023933). Promotes the processing of pri-let-7 microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) independently of its RNA pseudouridylate synthase activity (PubMed:32926445). Acts by binding to the stem-loop structure on pri-let-7, preventing LIN28-binding (LIN28A and/or LIN28B), thereby enhancing the interaction between pri-let-7 and the microprocessor DGCR8, which mediates miRNA maturation (PubMed:32926445).
