UniprotID	Q8TAI7
Accession	Q8TAI7;Q56VH8
EntryName	REBL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	GTPase RhebL1 (EC 3.6.5.-) (Ras homolog enriched in brain like-1 c) (RhebL1c) (Ras homolog enriched in brain-like protein 1) (Rheb-like protein 1) (Rheb2)
GeneName	RHEBL1
Length	183
Function	Binds GTP and exhibits intrinsic GTPase activity (By similarity). May activate NF-kappa-B-mediated gene transcription (PubMed:16328882). Promotes signal transduction through MTOR, activates RPS6KB1, and is a downstream target of the small GTPase-activating proteins TSC1 and TSC2.
Subcellular Location	Endomembrane system; Cytoplasm
