UniprotID	Q6PIY7
Accession	Q6PIY7;Q86WZ2;Q8N927
EntryName	GLD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Poly(A) RNA polymerase GLD2 (hGLD-2) (EC 2.7.7.19) (PAP-associated domain-containing protein 4) (Terminal nucleotidyltransferase 2) (Terminal uridylyltransferase 2) (TUTase 2)
GeneName	TENT2 GLD2 PAPD4
Length	484
Function	Cytoplasmic poly(A) RNA polymerase that adds successive AMP monomers to the 3'-end of specific RNAs, forming a poly(A) tail (PubMed:15070731, PubMed:31792053). In contrast to the canonical nuclear poly(A) RNA polymerase, it only adds poly(A) to selected cytoplasmic mRNAs (PubMed:15070731). Does not play a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation (PubMed:18172165). Adds a single nucleotide to the 3' end of specific miRNAs, monoadenylation stabilizes and prolongs the activity of some but not all miRNAs (PubMed:23200856, PubMed:31792053).
