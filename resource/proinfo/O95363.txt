UniprotID	O95363
Accession	O95363;B2R664;Q53F66;Q5TCS3;Q6FG29;Q9NPY7;Q9P062
EntryName	SYFM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phenylalanine--tRNA ligase, mitochondrial (EC 6.1.1.20) (Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase) (PheRS)
GeneName	FARS2 FARS1 HSPC320
Length	451
Function	Is responsible for the charging of tRNA(Phe) with phenylalanine in mitochondrial translation. To a lesser extent, also catalyzes direct attachment of m-Tyr (an oxidized version of Phe) to tRNA(Phe), thereby opening the way for delivery of the misacylated tRNA to the ribosome and incorporation of ROS-damaged amino acid into proteins.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix; Mitochondrion
