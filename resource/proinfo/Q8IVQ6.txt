UniprotID	Q8IVQ6
Accession	Q8IVQ6;A8KA95;D3DRI7;Q5VWG1
EntryName	ZDH21_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC21 (EC 2.3.1.225) (DHHC domain-containing cysteine-rich protein 21) (DHHC-21) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 21)
GeneName	ZDHHC21
Length	265
Function	Palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of palmitate onto various protein substrates (PubMed:22031296). Palmitoylates sex steroid hormone receptors, including ESR1, PGR and AR, thereby regulating their targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:22031296). This affects rapid intracellular signaling by sex hormones via ERK and AKT kinases and the generation of cAMP, but does not affect that mediated by their nuclear receptor (PubMed:22031296). Palmitoylates FYN, regulates its localization in hair follicles and plays a key role in epidermal homeostasis and hair follicle differentiation. Through the palmitoylation of PLCB1 and the regulation of PLCB1 downstream signaling may indirectly regulate the function of the endothelial barrier and the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium. Also has a palmitoyltransferase activity toward ADRA1D, positively regulating its activity and expression and may thereby play a role in vascular contraction. May also palmitoylate eNOS and LCK (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Golgi apparatus; cis-Golgi network membrane; Cell membrane
