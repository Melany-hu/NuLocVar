UniprotID	Q9BQC3
Accession	Q9BQC3;A8MVC9;B2RDE3;B4DNI8;O60623
EntryName	DPH2_HUMAN
ProteinName	2-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)histidine synthase subunit 2 (Diphthamide biosynthesis protein 2) (Diphtheria toxin resistance protein 2) (S-adenosyl-L-methionine:L-histidine 3-amino-3-carboxypropyltransferase 2)
GeneName	DPH2 DPH2L2
Length	489
Function	Required for the first step of diphthamide biosynthesis, a post-translational modification of histidine which occurs in elongation factor 2 (PubMed:32576952). DPH1 and DPH2 transfer a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to a histidine residue, the reaction is assisted by a reduction system comprising DPH3 and a NADH-dependent reductase (By similarity). Facilitates the reduction of the catalytic iron-sulfur cluster found in the DPH1 subunit (By similarity).
