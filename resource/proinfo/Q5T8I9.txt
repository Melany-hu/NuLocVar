UniprotID	Q5T8I9
Accession	Q5T8I9;A8MRR6;B1AM16;B1AM17;Q96EJ7;Q96NN0
EntryName	HENMT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small RNA 2'-O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.386) (HEN1 methyltransferase homolog 1)
GeneName	HENMT1 C1orf59
Length	393
Function	Methyltransferase that adds a 2'-O-methyl group at the 3'-end of piRNAs, a class of 24 to 30 nucleotide RNAs that are generated by a Dicer-independent mechanism and are primarily derived from transposons and other repeated sequence elements. This probably protects the 3'-end of piRNAs from uridylation activity and subsequent degradation. Stabilization of piRNAs is essential for gametogenesis.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
