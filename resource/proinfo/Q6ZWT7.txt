ProteinName	Lysophospholipid acyltransferase 2 (LPLAT 2) (EC 2.3.1.-) (1-acylglycerophosphate O-acyltransferase MBOAT2) (EC 2.3.1.51) (1-acylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase MBOAT2) (EC 2.3.1.23) (1-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine MBOAT2 O-acyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.n7) (Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase) (LPAAT) (Lyso-PA acyltransferase) (Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase) (LPCAT) (Lyso-PC acyltransferase) (Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 4) (Lyso-PC acyltransferase 4) (Lysophosphatidylethanolamine acyltransferase) (LPEAT) (Lyso-PE acyltransferase) (Membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing protein 2) (O-acyltransferase domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	MBOAT2 LPCAT4 OACT2
Length	520
Function	Acyltransferase which catalyzes the transfer of an acyl group from an acyl-CoA to a lysophospholipid leading to the production of a phospholipid and participates in the reacylation step of the phospholipid remodeling pathway also known as the Lands cycle (PubMed:18772128). Catalyzes preferentially the acylation of lysophosphatidylethanolamine (1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or LPE) and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and to a lesser extend lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and lysophosphatidylserine (LPS) (PubMed:18772128). Prefers oleoyl-CoA as the acyl donor (PubMed:18772128). May be involved in chondrocyte differentiation (By similarity).
