UniprotID	Q9BQ15
Accession	Q9BQ15;A6NDF8;Q6XYC8
EntryName	SOSB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	SOSS complex subunit B1 (Nucleic acid-binding protein 2) (Oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold-containing protein 2B) (Sensor of single-strand DNA complex subunit B1) (Sensor of ssDNA subunit B1) (SOSS-B1) (Single-stranded DNA-binding protein 1) (hSSB1)
GeneName	NABP2 OBFC2B SSB1 LP3587
Length	211
Function	Component of the SOSS complex, a multiprotein complex that functions downstream of the MRN complex to promote DNA repair and G2/M checkpoint (PubMed:25249620). In the SOSS complex, acts as a sensor of single-stranded DNA that binds to single-stranded DNA, in particular to polypyrimidines. The SOSS complex associates with DNA lesions and influences diverse endpoints in the cellular DNA damage response including cell-cycle checkpoint activation, recombinational repair and maintenance of genomic stability. Required for efficient homologous recombination-dependent repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and ATM-dependent signaling pathways.
