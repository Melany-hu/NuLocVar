UniprotID	Q86UW1
Accession	Q86UW1;Q6ZMC7
EntryName	OSTA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Organic solute transporter subunit alpha (OST-alpha) (Solute carrier family 51 subunit alpha)
GeneName	SLC51A OSTA
Length	340
Function	Essential component of the Ost-alpha/Ost-beta complex, a heterodimer that acts as the intestinal basolateral transporter responsible for bile acid export from enterocytes into portal blood (PubMed:16317684). Efficiently transports the major species of bile acids (taurocholate) (PubMed:16317684). Taurine conjugates are transported more efficiently across the basolateral membrane than glycine-conjugated bile acids (By similarity). Can also transport steroids such as estrone 3-sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate, therefore playing a role in the enterohepatic circulation of sterols (PubMed:16317684). Able to transport eicosanoids such as prostaglandin E2 (By similarity).
