EntryName	PAFA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF acetylhydrolase) (EC 3.1.1.47) (1-alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine esterase) (2-acetyl-1-alkylglycerophosphocholine esterase) (Group-VIIA phospholipase A2) (gVIIA-PLA2) (LDL-associated phospholipase A2) (LDL-PLA(2)) (PAF 2-acylhydrolase)
GeneName	PLA2G7 PAFAH
Length	441
Function	Lipoprotein-associated calcium-independent phospholipase A2 involved in phospholipid catabolism during inflammatory and oxidative stress response (PubMed:10066756, PubMed:16371369, PubMed:17090529, PubMed:2040620, PubMed:7700381, PubMed:8624782). At the lipid-aqueous interface, hydrolyzes the ester bond of fatty acyl group attached at sn-2 position of phospholipids (phospholipase A2 activity) (PubMed:10504265, PubMed:2040620). Specifically targets phospholipids with a short-chain fatty acyl group at sn-2 position (PubMed:2040620). Can hydrolyze phospholipids with long fatty acyl chains, only if they carry oxidized functional groups (PubMed:2040620, PubMed:8624782). Hydrolyzes and inactivates platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), a potent pro-inflammatory signaling lipid that acts through PTAFR on various innate immune cells (PubMed:10066756, PubMed:10504265, PubMed:11590221, PubMed:16371369, PubMed:18434304, PubMed:7592717, PubMed:7700381, PubMed:8624782, PubMed:8675689). Hydrolyzes oxidatively truncated phospholipids carrying an aldehyde group at omega position, preventing their accumulation in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and uncontrolled pro-inflammatory effects (PubMed:2040620, PubMed:7700381). As part of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, can hydrolyze phospholipids having long-chain fatty acyl hydroperoxides at sn-2 position and protect against potential accumulation of these oxylipins in the vascular wall (PubMed:17090529). Catalyzes the release from membrane phospholipids of F2-isoprostanes, lipid biomarkers of cellular oxidative damage (PubMed:16371369).
