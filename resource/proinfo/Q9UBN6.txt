UniprotID	Q9UBN6
Accession	Q9UBN6;B2R8W0;Q9Y6Q4
EntryName	TR10D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10D (Decoy receptor 2) (DcR2) (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 4) (TRAIL receptor 4) (TRAIL-R4) (TRAIL receptor with a truncated death domain) (CD antigen CD264)
GeneName	TNFRSF10D DCR2 TRAILR4 TRUNDD UNQ251/PRO288
Length	386
Function	Receptor for the cytotoxic ligand TRAIL (PubMed:9430226). Contains a truncated death domain and hence is not capable of inducing apoptosis but protects against TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (PubMed:9537512). Reports are contradictory with regards to its ability to induce the NF-kappa-B pathway. According to PubMed:9382840, it cannot but according to PubMed:9430226, it can induce the NF-kappa-B pathway (PubMed:9382840, PubMed:9430226).
