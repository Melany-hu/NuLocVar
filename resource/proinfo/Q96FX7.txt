UniprotID	Q96FX7
Accession	Q96FX7;A6NN78;Q8N7Q9
EntryName	TRM61_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA (adenine(58)-N(1))-methyltransferase catalytic subunit TRMT61A (EC 2.1.1.220) (mRNA methyladenosine-N(1)-methyltransferase catalytic subunit TRMT61A) (EC 2.1.1.-) (tRNA(m1A58)-methyltransferase subunit TRMT61A) (tRNA(m1A58)MTase subunit TRMT61A)
GeneName	TRMT61A C14orf172 TRM61
Length	289
Function	Catalytic subunit of tRNA (adenine-N(1)-)-methyltransferase, which catalyzes the formation of N(1)-methyladenine at position 58 (m1A58) in initiator methionyl-tRNA (PubMed:16043508). Catalytic subunit of mRNA N(1)-methyltransferase complex, which mediates methylation of adenosine residues at the N(1) position of a small subset of mRNAs: N(1) methylation takes place in tRNA T-loop-like structures of mRNAs and is only present at low stoichiometries (PubMed:29072297, PubMed:29107537).
