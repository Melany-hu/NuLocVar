Accession	O14763;O14720;O15508;O15517;O15531;Q6UXM8;Q7Z360;Q9BVE0
EntryName	TR10B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10B (Death receptor 5) (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 2) (TRAIL receptor 2) (TRAIL-R2) (CD antigen CD262)
GeneName	TNFRSF10B DR5 KILLER TRAILR2 TRICK2 ZTNFR9 UNQ160/PRO186
Length	440
Function	Receptor for the cytotoxic ligand TNFSF10/TRAIL (PubMed:10549288). The adapter molecule FADD recruits caspase-8 to the activated receptor. The resulting death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) performs caspase-8 proteolytic activation which initiates the subsequent cascade of caspases (aspartate-specific cysteine proteases) mediating apoptosis. Promotes the activation of NF-kappa-B. Essential for ER stress-induced apoptosis.
