UniprotID	P62140
Accession	P62140;B2R5V4;D6W565;P37140;Q5U087;Q6FG45
EntryName	PP1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1-beta catalytic subunit (PP-1B) (PPP1CD) (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.53)
GeneName	PPP1CB
Length	327
Function	Protein phosphatase that associates with over 200 regulatory proteins to form highly specific holoenzymes which dephosphorylate hundreds of biological targets. Protein phosphatase (PP1) is essential for cell division, it participates in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, muscle contractility and protein synthesis. Involved in regulation of ionic conductances and long-term synaptic plasticity. Component of the PTW/PP1 phosphatase complex, which plays a role in the control of chromatin structure and cell cycle progression during the transition from mitosis into interphase. In balance with CSNK1D and CSNK1E, determines the circadian period length, through the regulation of the speed and rhythmicity of PER1 and PER2 phosphorylation. May dephosphorylate CSNK1D and CSNK1E. Dephosphorylates the 'Ser-418' residue of FOXP3 in regulatory T-cells (Treg) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, thereby inactivating FOXP3 and rendering Treg cells functionally defective (PubMed:23396208). Core component of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1c (SMP) holophosphatase complex that regulates the MAPK pathway activation (PubMed:35768504, PubMed:35831509, PubMed:36175670). The SMP complex specifically dephosphorylates the inhibitory phosphorylation at 'Ser-259' of RAF1 kinase, 'Ser-365' of BRAF kinase and 'Ser-214' of ARAF kinase, stimulating their kinase activities (PubMed:35768504, PubMed:35831509, PubMed:36175670). The SMP complex enhances the dephosphorylation activity and substrate specificity of PP1c (PubMed:35768504, PubMed:36175670).
