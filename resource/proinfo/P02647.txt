UniprotID	P02647
Accession	P02647;A8K866;Q6LDN9;Q6Q785;Q9UCS8;Q9UCT8
EntryName	APOA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Apolipoprotein A-I (Apo-AI) (ApoA-I) (Apolipoprotein A1) [Cleaved into: Proapolipoprotein A-I (ProapoA-I); Truncated apolipoprotein A-I (Apolipoprotein A-I(1-242))]
GeneName	APOA1
Length	267
Function	Participates in the reverse transport of cholesterol from tissues to the liver for excretion by promoting cholesterol efflux from tissues and by acting as a cofactor for the lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). As part of the SPAP complex, activates spermatozoa motility.
