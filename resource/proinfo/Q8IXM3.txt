UniprotID	Q8IXM3
Accession	Q8IXM3;Q96Q49
EntryName	RM41_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein mL41 (39S ribosomal protein L41, mitochondrial) (L41mt) (MRP-L41) (Bcl-2-interacting mitochondrial ribosomal protein L41) (Cell proliferation-inducing gene 3 protein) (MRP-L27 homolog)
GeneName	MRPL41 BMRP MRPL27 RPML27 PIG3
Length	137
Function	Component of the mitochondrial ribosome large subunit (PubMed:25278503, PubMed:25838379, PubMed:28892042, PubMed:35177605). Also involved in apoptosis and cell cycle (PubMed:16024796, PubMed:16256947). Enhances p53/TP53 stability, thereby contributing to p53/TP53-induced apoptosis in response to growth-inhibitory condition. Enhances p53/TP53 translocation to the mitochondria. Has the ability to arrest the cell cycle at the G1 phase, possibly by stabilizing the CDKN1A and CDKN1B (p27Kip1) proteins (PubMed:16024796).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
