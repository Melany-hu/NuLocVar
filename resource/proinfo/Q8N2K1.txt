UniprotID	Q8N2K1
Accession	Q8N2K1;A8MYC7;Q504T9;Q96N26;Q96T84
EntryName	UB2J2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J2 (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme J2) (Non-canonical ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2) (NCUBE-2)
GeneName	UBE2J2 NCUBE2
Length	259
Function	Catalyzes the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. Seems to function in the selective degradation of misfolded membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ERAD) (By similarity). In cooperation with the GATOR2 complex, catalyzes 'Lys-6'-linked ubiquitination of NPRL2 (PubMed:36528027).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
