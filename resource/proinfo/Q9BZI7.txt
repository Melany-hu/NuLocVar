UniprotID	Q9BZI7
Accession	Q9BZI7;D3DWI3;D3DWI4;Q0VAK8;Q9H1J0
EntryName	REN3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of nonsense transcripts 3B (Nonsense mRNA reducing factor 3B) (Up-frameshift suppressor 3 homolog B) (hUpf3B) (Up-frameshift suppressor 3 homolog on chromosome X) (hUpf3p-X)
GeneName	UPF3B RENT3B UPF3X
Length	483
Function	Involved in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mRNAs containing premature stop codons by associating with the nuclear exon junction complex (EJC) and serving as link between the EJC core and NMD machinery. Recruits UPF2 at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope and the subsequent formation of an UPF1-UPF2-UPF3 surveillance complex (including UPF1 bound to release factors at the stalled ribosome) is believed to activate NMD. In cooperation with UPF2 stimulates both ATPase and RNA helicase activities of UPF1. Binds spliced mRNA upstream of exon-exon junctions. In vitro, stimulates translation; the function is independent of association with UPF2 and components of the EJC core.
