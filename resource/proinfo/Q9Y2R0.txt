UniprotID	Q9Y2R0
Accession	Q9Y2R0;A8K498
EntryName	COA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 3 homolog, mitochondrial (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 56) (Mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase protein of 12 kDa)
GeneName	COA3 CCDC56 MITRAC12 HSPC009
Length	106
Function	Core component of the MITRAC (mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase complex) complex, that regulates cytochrome c oxidase assembly. MITRAC complexes regulate both translation of mitochondrial encoded components and assembly of nuclear-encoded components imported in mitochondrion. Required for efficient translation of MT-CO1 and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV assembly.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
