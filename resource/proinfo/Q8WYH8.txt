EntryName	ING5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inhibitor of growth protein 5 (p28ING5)
GeneName	ING5
Length	240
Function	Component of the HBO1 complex, which specifically mediates acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-14' (H3K14ac) and, to a lower extent, acetylation of histone H4 (PubMed:24065767). Component of the MOZ/MORF complex which has a histone H3 acetyltransferase activity (PubMed:16387653). Through chromatin acetylation it may regulate DNA replication and may function as a transcriptional coactivator (PubMed:12750254, PubMed:16387653). Inhibits cell growth, induces a delay in S-phase progression and enhances Fas-induced apoptosis in an INCA1-dependent manner (PubMed:21750715).
