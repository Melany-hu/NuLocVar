UniprotID	Q9BYR3
Accession	Q9BYR3;Q9BYU7
EntryName	KRA44_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 4-4 (Keratin-associated protein 4-13) (Keratin-associated protein 4.13) (Keratin-associated protein 4.4) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 4.13) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 4.4)
GeneName	KRTAP4-4 KAP4.13 KAP4.4 KRTAP4-13 KRTAP4.13 KRTAP4.4
Length	166
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
