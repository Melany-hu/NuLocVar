UniprotID	Q9NX63
Accession	Q9NX63
EntryName	MIC19_HUMAN
ProteinName	MICOS complex subunit MIC19 (Coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain-containing protein 3)
GeneName	CHCHD3 MIC19 MINOS3
Length	227
Function	Component of the MICOS complex, a large protein complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane that plays crucial roles in the maintenance of crista junctions, inner membrane architecture, and formation of contact sites to the outer membrane (PubMed:25781180, PubMed:32567732, PubMed:33130824). Plays an important role in the maintenance of the MICOS complex stability and the mitochondrial cristae morphology (PubMed:25781180, PubMed:32567732, PubMed:33130824). Has also been shown to function as a transcription factor which binds to the BAG1 promoter and represses BAG1 transcription (PubMed:22567091).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Mitochondrion
