EntryName	BIN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myc box-dependent-interacting protein 1 (Amphiphysin II) (Amphiphysin-like protein) (Box-dependent myc-interacting protein 1) (Bridging integrator 1)
GeneName	BIN1 AMPHL
Length	593
Function	Is a key player in the control of plasma membrane curvature, membrane shaping and membrane remodeling. Required in muscle cells for the formation of T-tubules, tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane that function in depolarization-contraction coupling (PubMed:24755653). Is a negative regulator of endocytosis (By similarity). Is also involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicles sorting, modulation of BACE1 trafficking and the control of amyloid-beta production (PubMed:27179792). In neuronal circuits, endocytosis regulation may influence the internalization of PHF-tau aggregates (By similarity). May be involved in the regulation of MYC activity and the control cell proliferation (PubMed:8782822). Has actin bundling activity and stabilizes actin filaments against depolymerization in vitro (PubMed:28893863).
