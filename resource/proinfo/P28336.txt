EntryName	NMBR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuromedin-B receptor (NMB-R) (Epididymis tissue protein Li 185a) (Neuromedin-B-preferring bombesin receptor)
GeneName	NMBR
Length	390
Function	Receptor for neuromedin-B (PubMed:1655761). Contributes to the maintenance of basal sigh rate through signaling in the pre-Botzinger complex, a cluster of several thousand neurons in the ventrolateral medulla responsible for inspiration during respiratory activity (By similarity). Contributes to the induction of sneezing following exposure to chemical irritants or allergens which causes release of NMB by nasal sensory neurons and activation of NMBR-expressing neurons in the sneeze-evoking region of the brainstem (By similarity). These in turn activate neurons of the caudal ventral respiratory group, giving rise to the sneezing response (By similarity). Contributes to induction of acute itch, possibly through its activation on dorsal root ganglion neurons by the NMB peptide (By similarity). Plays a role in the innate immune response to influenza A virus infection by enhancing interferon alpha expression and reducing expression of IL6 (PubMed:31601264). Plays a role in CSF1-induced proliferation of osteoclast precursors by contributing to the positive regulation of the expression of the CSF1 receptor CSF1R (By similarity).
