UniprotID	P01574
Accession	P01574;Q5VWC9
EntryName	IFNB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon beta (IFN-beta) (Fibroblast interferon)
GeneName	IFNB1 IFB IFNB
Length	187
Function	Type I interferon cytokine that plays a key role in the innate immune response to infection, developing tumors and other inflammatory stimuli (PubMed:10049744, PubMed:10556041, PubMed:6157094, PubMed:6171735, PubMed:7665574, PubMed:8027027, PubMed:8969169). Signals via binding to high-affinity (IFNAR2) and low-affinity (IFNAR1) heterodimeric receptor, activating the canonical Jak-STAT signaling pathway resulting in transcriptional activation or repression of interferon-regulated genes that encode the effectors of the interferon response, such as antiviral proteins, regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation, and immunoregulatory proteins (PubMed:10049744, PubMed:10556041, PubMed:7665574, PubMed:8027027, PubMed:8969169). Signals mostly via binding to a IFNAR1-IFNAR2 heterodimeric receptor, but can also function with IFNAR1 alone and independently of Jak-STAT pathways (By similarity). Elicits a wide variety of responses, including antiviral and antibacterial activities, and can regulate the development of B-cells, myelopoiesis and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible production of tumor necrosis factor (By similarity). Plays a role in neuronal homeostasis by regulating dopamine turnover and protecting dopaminergic neurons: acts by promoting neuronal autophagy and alpha-synuclein clearance, thereby preventing dopaminergic neuron loss (By similarity). IFNB1 is more potent than interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in inducing the apoptotic and antiproliferative pathways required for control of tumor cell growth (By similarity).
