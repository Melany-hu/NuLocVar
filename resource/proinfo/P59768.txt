UniprotID	P59768
Accession	P59768;Q5JPE2;Q6P9A9
EntryName	GBG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(O) subunit gamma-2 (G gamma-I)
GeneName	GNG2
Length	71
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems (PubMed:29925951, PubMed:33762731, PubMed:34239069, PubMed:35610220, PubMed:35714614, PubMed:35835867, PubMed:36087581, PubMed:36989299, PubMed:37327704, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37935377, PubMed:37963465, PubMed:38168118, PubMed:38552625). The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction (PubMed:29925951, PubMed:33762731, PubMed:34239069, PubMed:35610220, PubMed:35714614, PubMed:35835867, PubMed:36087581, PubMed:36989299, PubMed:37327704, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37935377, PubMed:37963465, PubMed:38168118, PubMed:38552625).
