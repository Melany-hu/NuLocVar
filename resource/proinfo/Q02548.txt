EntryName	PAX5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Paired box protein Pax-5 (B-cell-specific transcription factor) (BSAP)
GeneName	PAX5
Length	391
Function	Transcription factor that plays an essential role in commitment of lymphoid progenitors to the B-lymphocyte lineage (PubMed:10811620, PubMed:27181361). Fulfills a dual role by repressing B-lineage inappropriate genes and simultaneously activating B-lineage-specific genes (PubMed:10811620, PubMed:27181361). In turn, regulates cell adhesion and migration, induces V(H)-to-D(H)J(H) recombination, facilitates pre-B-cell receptor signaling and promotes development to the mature B-cell stage (PubMed:32612238). Repression of the cohesin-release factor WAPL causes global changes of the chromosomal architecture in pro-B cells to facilitate the generation of a diverse antibody repertoire (PubMed:32612238).
