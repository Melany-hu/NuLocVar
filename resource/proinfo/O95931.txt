Accession	O95931;Q86T17
EntryName	CBX7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chromobox protein homolog 7
GeneName	CBX7
Length	251
Function	Component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones; it mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119', rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility. Promotes histone H3 trimethylation at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me3). Binds to trimethylated lysine residues in histones, and possibly also other proteins. Regulator of cellular lifespan by maintaining the repression of CDKN2A, but not by inducing telomerase activity.
