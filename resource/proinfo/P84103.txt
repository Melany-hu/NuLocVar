UniprotID	P84103
Accession	P84103;B4E241;O08831;P23152;Q5R3K0
EntryName	SRSF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (Pre-mRNA-splicing factor SRP20) (Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 3)
GeneName	SRSF3 SFRS3 SRP20
Length	164
Function	Splicing factor, which binds the consensus motif 5'-CCC-3' within pre-mRNA and promotes specific exons inclusion during alternative splicing (PubMed:17036044, PubMed:26876937, PubMed:32440474). Interaction with YTHDC1, a RNA-binding protein that recognizes and binds N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing RNAs, promotes recruitment of SRSF3 to its mRNA-binding elements adjacent to m6A sites within exons (PubMed:26876937). Also functions as an adapter involved in mRNA nuclear export (PubMed:11336712, PubMed:18364396, PubMed:28984244). Binds mRNA which is thought to be transferred to the NXF1-NXT1 heterodimer for export (TAP/NXF1 pathway); enhances NXF1-NXT1 RNA-binding activity (PubMed:11336712, PubMed:18364396). Involved in nuclear export of m6A-containing mRNAs via interaction with YTHDC1: interaction with YTHDC1 facilitates m6A-containing mRNA-binding to both SRSF3 and NXF1, promoting mRNA nuclear export (PubMed:28984244).
