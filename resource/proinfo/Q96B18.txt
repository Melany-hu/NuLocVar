UniprotID	Q96B18
Accession	Q96B18
EntryName	DACT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dapper homolog 3 (Antagonist of beta-catenin Dapper homolog 3) (Arginine-rich region 1 protein) (Dapper antagonist of catenin 3)
GeneName	DACT3 RRR1
Length	629
Function	May be involved in regulation of intracellular signaling pathways during development. Specifically thought to play a role in canonical and/or non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways through interaction with DSH (Dishevelled) family proteins.
