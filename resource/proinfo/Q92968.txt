UniprotID	Q92968
Accession	Q92968;B2RCS1
EntryName	PEX13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisomal membrane protein PEX13 (Peroxin-13)
GeneName	PEX13
Length	403
Function	Component of the PEX13-PEX14 docking complex, a translocon channel that specifically mediates the import of peroxisomal cargo proteins bound to PEX5 receptor (PubMed:28765278, PubMed:8858165, PubMed:9653144). The PEX13-PEX14 docking complex forms a large import pore which can be opened to a diameter of about 9 nm (By similarity). Mechanistically, PEX5 receptor along with cargo proteins associates with the PEX14 subunit of the PEX13-PEX14 docking complex in the cytosol, leading to the insertion of the receptor into the organelle membrane with the concomitant translocation of the cargo into the peroxisome matrix (PubMed:28765278, PubMed:8858165, PubMed:9653144). Involved in the import of PTS1- and PTS2-type containing proteins (PubMed:8858165, PubMed:9653144).
