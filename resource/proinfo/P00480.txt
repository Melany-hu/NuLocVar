EntryName	OTC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ornithine transcarbamylase, mitochondrial (OTCase) (EC 2.1.3.3) (Ornithine carbamoyltransferase, mitochondrial)
GeneName	OTC
Length	354
Function	Catalyzes the second step of the urea cycle, the condensation of carbamoyl phosphate with L-ornithine to form L-citrulline (PubMed:2556444, PubMed:6372096, PubMed:8112735). The urea cycle ensures the detoxification of ammonia by converting it to urea for excretion (PubMed:2556444).
