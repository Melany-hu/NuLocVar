UniprotID	Q9NPJ4
Accession	Q9NPJ4;B4DU72
EntryName	PNRC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator 2
GeneName	PNRC2 HSPC208
Length	139
Function	Involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by acting as a bridge between the mRNA decapping complex and the NMD machinery (PubMed:19150429). May act by targeting the NMD machinery to the P-body and recruiting the decapping machinery to aberrant mRNAs (PubMed:19150429). Required for UPF1/RENT1 localization to the P-body (PubMed:19150429). Plays a role in glucocorticoid receptor-mediated mRNA degradation by interacting with the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 in a ligand-dependent manner when it is bound to the 5' UTR of target mRNAs and recruiting the RNA helicase UPF1 and the mRNA-decapping enzyme DCP1A, leading to RNA decay (PubMed:25775514). Also acts as a nuclear receptor coactivator (PubMed:11574675). May play a role in controlling the energy balance between energy storage and energy expenditure (By similarity).
