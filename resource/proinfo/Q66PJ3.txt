UniprotID	Q66PJ3
Accession	Q66PJ3;A4UCR8;B3V0L0;B3V0L1;Q4F966;Q504R8;Q96BI2;Q9NR05;Q9P2R9
EntryName	AR6P4_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 6-interacting protein 4 (ARL-6-interacting protein 4) (Aip-4) (HSP-975) (HSVI-binding protein) (SR-15) (SRp25) (SR-25) (Splicing factor SRrp37)
GeneName	ARL6IP4
Length	237
Function	Involved in modulating alternative pre-mRNA splicing with either 5' distal site activation or preferential use of 3' proximal site. In case of infection by Herpes simplex virus (HSVI), may act as a splicing inhibitor of HSVI pre-mRNA.
