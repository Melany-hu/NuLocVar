UniprotID	O60906
Accession	O60906;Q5TED1;Q9BWR3
EntryName	NSMA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 2 (EC 3.1.4.12) (Lyso-platelet-activating factor-phospholipase C) (Lyso-PAF-PLC) (Neutral sphingomyelinase) (N-SMase) (nSMase) (nSMase1)
GeneName	SMPD2
Length	423
Function	Catalyzes, at least in vitro, the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to form ceramide and phosphocholine (PubMed:10608884). Also hydrolyzes 1-O-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-platelet-activating factor) in vivo (PubMed:10608884). Also acts on 1-acyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PC) and sphingosylphosphocholine (PubMed:10608884, PubMed:14741383).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
