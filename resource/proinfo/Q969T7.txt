UniprotID	Q969T7
Accession	Q969T7;A8MWB9;C9JKC4;Q7L3B7
EntryName	5NT3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	7-methylguanosine phosphate-specific 5'-nucleotidase (7-methylguanosine nucleotidase) (EC 3.1.3.91) (Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 3B) (Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase III-like protein) (cN-III-like protein) (EC 3.1.3.5) (N(7)-methylguanylate 5'-phosphatase)
GeneName	NT5C3B NT5C3L
Length	300
Function	Specifically hydrolyzes 7-methylguanosine monophosphate (m(7)GMP) to 7-methylguanosine and inorganic phosphate (PubMed:23223233, PubMed:24603684). The specific activity for m(7)GMP may protect cells against undesired salvage of m(7)GMP and its incorporation into nucleic acids (PubMed:23223233). Also has weak activity for CMP (PubMed:23223233, PubMed:24603684). UMP and purine nucleotides are poor substrates (PubMed:23223233).
