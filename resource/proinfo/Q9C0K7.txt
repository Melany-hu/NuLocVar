UniprotID	Q9C0K7
Accession	Q9C0K7;Q5BKY7;Q9P1L0
EntryName	STRAB_HUMAN
ProteinName	STE20-related kinase adapter protein beta (STRAD beta) (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2 chromosomal region candidate gene 2 protein) (CALS-21) (ILP-interacting protein) (Pseudokinase ALS2CR2)
GeneName	STRADB ALS2CR2 ILPIP PRO1038
Length	418
Function	Pseudokinase which, in complex with CAB39/MO25 (CAB39/MO25alpha or CAB39L/MO25beta), binds to and activates STK11/LKB1. Adopts a closed conformation typical of active protein kinases and binds STK11/LKB1 as a pseudosubstrate, promoting conformational change of STK11/LKB1 in an active conformation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm
