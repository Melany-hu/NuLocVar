Accession	Q9NNW7;O95840;Q96IJ2;Q9H2Z5;Q9NZV3;Q9NZV4;Q9P2Y0;Q9P2Y1;Q9UQU8
EntryName	TRXR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thioredoxin reductase 2, mitochondrial (EC 1.8.1.9) (Selenoprotein Z) (SelZ) (TR-beta) (Thioredoxin reductase TR3)
GeneName	TXNRD2 KIAA1652 TRXR2
Length	524
Function	Involved in the control of reactive oxygen species levels and the regulation of mitochondrial redox homeostasis (PubMed:24601690). Maintains thioredoxin in a reduced state. May play a role in redox-regulated cell signaling.
