UniprotID	P09341
Accession	P09341;Q9UCR7
EntryName	GROA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Growth-regulated alpha protein (C-X-C motif chemokine 1) (GRO-alpha(1-73)) (Melanoma growth stimulatory activity) (MGSA) (Neutrophil-activating protein 3) (NAP-3) [Cleaved into: GRO-alpha(4-73); GRO-alpha(5-73); GRO-alpha(6-73)]
GeneName	CXCL1 GRO GRO1 GROA MGSA SCYB1
Length	107
Function	Has chemotactic activity for neutrophils. May play a role in inflammation and exerts its effects on endothelial cells in an autocrine fashion. In vitro, the processed forms GRO-alpha(4-73), GRO-alpha(5-73) and GRO-alpha(6-73) show a 30-fold higher chemotactic activity.
