EntryName	SEMG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Semenogelin-1 (Cancer/testis antigen 103) (Semenogelin I) (SGI) [Cleaved into: Alpha-inhibin-92; Alpha-inhibin-31; Seminal basic protein]
GeneName	SEMG1 SEMG
Length	462
Function	Predominant protein in semen. It participates in the formation of a gel matrix entrapping the accessory gland secretions and ejaculated spermatozoa. Fragments of semenogelin and/or fragments of the related proteins may contribute to the activation of progressive sperm movements as the gel-forming proteins are fragmented by KLK3/PSA.
