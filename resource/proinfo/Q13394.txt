UniprotID	Q13394
Accession	Q13394;Q6I9T5
EntryName	MB211_HUMAN
ProteinName	Putative nucleotidyltransferase MAB21L1 (EC 2.7.7.-) (Protein mab-21-like 1)
GeneName	MAB21L1 CAGR1 Nbla00126
Length	359
Function	Putative nucleotidyltransferase required for several aspects of embryonic development including normal development of the eye (PubMed:27103078, PubMed:30487245). It is unclear whether it displays nucleotidyltransferase activity in vivo (PubMed:27271801). Binds single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (PubMed:27271801).
