UniprotID	Q96FQ6
Accession	Q96FQ6;A8K439;D3DV52;Q5RHS6
EntryName	S10AG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein S100-A16 (Aging-associated gene 13 protein) (Protein S100-F) (S100 calcium-binding protein A16)
GeneName	S100A16 S100F AAG13
Length	103
Function	Calcium-binding protein. Binds one calcium ion per monomer (PubMed:17030513). Can promote differentiation of adipocytes (in vitro) (By similarity). Overexpression in preadipocytes increases their proliferation, enhances adipogenesis and reduces insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (By similarity).
