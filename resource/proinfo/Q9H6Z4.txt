Accession	Q9H6Z4;B2RAT8;O60405;O75759;O75760;Q9BT47;Q9UG74
EntryName	RANB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ran-binding protein 3 (RanBP3)
GeneName	RANBP3
Length	567
Function	Acts as a cofactor for XPO1/CRM1-mediated nuclear export, perhaps as export complex scaffolding protein. Bound to XPO1/CRM1, stabilizes the XPO1/CRM1-cargo interaction. In the absence of Ran-bound GTP prevents binding of XPO1/CRM1 to the nuclear pore complex. Binds to CHC1/RCC1 and increases the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of CHC1/RCC1. Recruits XPO1/CRM1 to CHC1/RCC1 in a Ran-dependent manner. Negative regulator of TGF-beta signaling through interaction with the R-SMAD proteins, SMAD2 and SMAD3, and mediating their nuclear export.
