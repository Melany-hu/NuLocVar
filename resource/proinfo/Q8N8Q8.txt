UniprotID	Q8N8Q8
Accession	Q8N8Q8;Q2PB66;Q2PB67;Q2PB68;Q49B97;Q6IPP9
EntryName	COX18_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein COX18, mitochondrial (COX18Hs) (Cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein 18)
GeneName	COX18 OXA1L2
Length	333
Function	Mitochondrial membrane insertase required for the translocation of the C-terminus of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (MT-CO2/COX2) across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Plays a role in MT-CO2/COX2 maturation following the COX20-mediated stabilization of newly synthesized MT-CO2/COX2 protein and before the action of the metallochaperones SCO1/2. Essential for the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (also known as cytochrome c oxidase).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
