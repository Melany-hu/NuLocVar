UniprotID	Q9NSP4
Accession	Q9NSP4;A7LM22;B1AHQ9;Q6I9W3
EntryName	CENPM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Centromere protein M (CENP-M) (Interphase centromere complex protein 39) (Proliferation-associated nuclear element protein 1)
GeneName	CENPM C22orf18 ICEN39 PANE1
Length	180
Function	Component of the CENPA-NAC (nucleosome-associated) complex, a complex that plays a central role in assembly of kinetochore proteins, mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. The CENPA-NAC complex recruits the CENPA-CAD (nucleosome distal) complex and may be involved in incorporation of newly synthesized CENPA into centromeres.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Chromosome; Centromere; Kinetochore
