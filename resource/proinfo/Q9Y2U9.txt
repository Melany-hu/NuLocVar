Accession	Q9Y2U9;B3KPF9;Q6IAF0;Q86TY9
EntryName	KLDC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kelch domain-containing protein 2 (Hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 33) (Host cell factor homolog LCP) (Host cell factor-like protein 1) (HCLP-1)
GeneName	KLHDC2 HCA33
Length	406
Function	Substrate-recognition component of a Cul2-RING (CRL2) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex of the DesCEND (destruction via C-end degrons) pathway, which recognizes a C-degron located at the extreme C terminus of target proteins, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:29775578, PubMed:29779948, PubMed:30526872, PubMed:36805027, PubMed:38177675). The C-degron recognized by the DesCEND pathway is usually a motif of less than ten residues and can be present in full-length proteins, truncated proteins or proteolytically cleaved forms (PubMed:29775578, PubMed:29779948, PubMed:30526872). The CRL2(KLHDC2) complex specifically recognizes proteins with a diglycine (Gly-Gly) at the C-terminus, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:29775578, PubMed:29779948, PubMed:30526872, PubMed:36805027, PubMed:38177675). The CRL2(KLHDC2) complex mediates ubiquitination and degradation of truncated SELENOK and SELENOS selenoproteins produced by failed UGA/Sec decoding, which end with a diglycine (PubMed:26138980, PubMed:30526872, PubMed:36805027). The CRL2(KLHDC2) complex also recognizes proteolytically cleaved proteins ending with Gly-Gly, such as the N-terminal fragment of USP1, leading to their degradation (PubMed:29775578, PubMed:30526872, PubMed:36805027, PubMed:38177675). May also act as an indirect repressor of CREB3-mediated transcription by interfering with CREB3-DNA-binding (PubMed:11384994).
