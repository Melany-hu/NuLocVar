UniprotID	O60359
Accession	O60359
EntryName	CCG3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma-3 subunit (Neuronal voltage-gated calcium channel gamma-3 subunit) (Transmembrane AMPAR regulatory protein gamma-3) (TARP gamma-3)
GeneName	CACNG3
Length	315
Function	Regulates the trafficking to the somatodendritic compartment and gating properties of AMPA-selective glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Promotes their targeting to the cell membrane and synapses and modulates their gating properties by slowing their rates of activation, deactivation and desensitization. Does not show subunit-specific AMPA receptor regulation and regulates all AMPAR subunits. Thought to stabilize the calcium channel in an inactivated (closed) state.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
