EntryName	MEIKN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Meiosis-specific kinetochore protein
GeneName	MEIKIN
Length	373
Function	Key regulator of kinetochore function during meiosis I: required both for mono-orientation of kinetochores on sister chromosomes and protection of centromeric cohesin from separase-mediated cleavage. Acts by facilitating kinetochore mono-orientation during meiosis I, when kinetochores on sister chromosomes face the same direction and are thus captured and pulled by spindle fibers from the same pole. Also required to prevent cleavage of cohesin at centromeres during meiosis I, possibly by acting as a regulator of the shugoshin-dependent protection pathway. Acts in collaboration with PLK1: required for PLK1 enrichment to kinetochores. Not required during meiosis II or mitosis.
