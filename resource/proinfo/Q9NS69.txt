UniprotID	Q9NS69
Accession	Q9NS69
EntryName	TOM22_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM22 homolog (hTom22) (1C9-2) (Translocase of outer membrane 22 kDa subunit homolog)
GeneName	TOMM22 TOM22
Length	142
Function	Central receptor component of the translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondria (TOM complex) responsible for the recognition and translocation of cytosolically synthesized mitochondrial preproteins. Together with the peripheral receptor TOM20 functions as the transit peptide receptor and facilitates the movement of preproteins into the translocation pore (PubMed:10982837). Required for the translocation across the mitochondrial outer membrane of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane
