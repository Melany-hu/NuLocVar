UniprotID	Q16663
Accession	Q16663;B2RU34;E1P651;Q9UM74
EntryName	CCL15_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 15 (Chemokine CC-2) (HCC-2) (Leukotactin-1) (LKN-1) (MIP-1 delta) (Macrophage inflammatory protein 5) (MIP-5) (Mrp-2b) (NCC-3) (Small-inducible cytokine A15) [Cleaved into: CCL15(22-92); CCL15(25-92); CCL15(29-92)]
GeneName	CCL15 MIP5 NCC3 SCYA15
Length	113
Function	Chemotactic factor that attracts T-cells and monocytes, but not neutrophils, eosinophils, or B-cells. Acts mainly via CC chemokine receptor CCR1. Also binds to CCR3. CCL15(22-92), CCL15(25-92) and CCL15(29-92) are more potent chemoattractants than the CCL15.
