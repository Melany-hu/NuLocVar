ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ZNRF1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Nerve injury-induced gene 283 protein) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase ZNRF1) (Zinc/RING finger protein 1)
GeneName	ZNRF1 NIN283
Length	227
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a role in different processes including cell differentiation, receptor recycling or regulation of inflammation (PubMed:28593998, PubMed:33996800, PubMed:37158982). Mediates the ubiquitination of AKT1 and GLUL, thereby playing a role in neuron cells differentiation. Plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of neuronal transmission and plasticity. Regulates Schwann cells differentiation by mediating ubiquitination of GLUL. Promotes neurodegeneration by mediating 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of AKT1 in axons: degradation of AKT1 prevents AKT1-mediated phosphorylation of GSK3B, leading to GSK3B activation and phosphorylation of DPYSL2/CRMP2 followed by destabilization of microtubule assembly in axons. Ubiquitinates the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase alpha-1 subunit/ATP1A1 and thereby influences its endocytosis and/or degradation (PubMed:22797923). Controls ligand-induced EGFR signaling via mediating receptor ubiquitination and recruitment of the ESCRT machinery (PubMed:33996800). Acts as a negative feedback mechanism controlling TLR3 trafficking by mediating TLR3 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination to reduce type I IFN production (PubMed:37158982). Modulates inflammation by promoting caveolin-1/CAV1 ubiquitination and degradation to regulate TLR4-activated immune response (PubMed:28593998).
