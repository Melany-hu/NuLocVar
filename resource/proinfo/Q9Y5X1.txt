UniprotID	Q9Y5X1
Accession	Q9Y5X1;Q9BSI7;Q9BVM1;Q9UJH6;Q9UP20
EntryName	SNX9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sorting nexin-9 (SH3 and PX domain-containing protein 1) (Protein SDP1) (SH3 and PX domain-containing protein 3A)
GeneName	SNX9 SH3PX1 SH3PXD3A
Length	595
Function	Involved in endocytosis and intracellular vesicle trafficking, both during interphase and at the end of mitosis. Required for efficient progress through mitosis and cytokinesis. Required for normal formation of the cleavage furrow at the end of mitosis. Plays a role in endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits, but also clathrin-independent, actin-dependent fluid-phase endocytosis. Plays a role in macropinocytosis. Promotes internalization of TNFR. Promotes degradation of EGFR after EGF signaling. Stimulates the GTPase activity of DNM1. Promotes DNM1 oligomerization. Promotes activation of the Arp2/3 complex by WASL, and thereby plays a role in the reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton. Binds to membranes enriched in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and promotes membrane tubulation. Has lower affinity for membranes enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate.
