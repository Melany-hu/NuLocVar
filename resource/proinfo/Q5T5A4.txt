UniprotID	Q5T5A4
Accession	Q5T5A4;Q5T5A3
EntryName	CF276_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 276
GeneName	CFAP276 C1orf194
Length	169
Function	Microtubule inner protein (MIP) part of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in cilia axoneme, which is required for motile cilia beating (PubMed:36191189). May play an important role for the maintenance of myelin-axon integrity (By similarity). May affect intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis (PubMed:31199454).
