UniprotID	P58166
Accession	P58166
EntryName	INHBE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inhibin beta E chain (Activin beta-E chain)
GeneName	INHBE
Length	350
Function	Inhibins and activins inhibit and activate, respectively, the secretion of follitropin by the pituitary gland. Inhibins/activins are involved in regulating a number of diverse functions such as hypothalamic and pituitary hormone secretion, gonadal hormone secretion, germ cell development and maturation, erythroid differentiation, insulin secretion, nerve cell survival, embryonic axial development or bone growth, depending on their subunit composition. Inhibins appear to oppose the functions of activins.
