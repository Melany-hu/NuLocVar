ProteinName	Phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) (Group IB phospholipase A2) (Phosphatidylcholine 2-acylhydrolase 1B)
GeneName	PLA2G1B PLA2 PLA2A PPLA2
Length	148
Function	Secretory calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 that primarily targets dietary phospholipids in the intestinal tract (PubMed:10681567, PubMed:1420353, PubMed:17603006). Hydrolyzes the ester bond of the fatty acyl group attached at sn-2 position of phospholipids (phospholipase A2 activity) with preference for phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylglycerols over phosphatidylcholines (PubMed:10681567, PubMed:1420353, PubMed:17603006). May play a role in the biosynthesis of N-acyl ethanolamines that regulate energy metabolism and inflammation in the intestinal tract. Hydrolyzes N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines to N-acyl lysophosphatidylethanolamines, which are further cleaved by a lysophospholipase D to release N-acyl ethanolamines (By similarity). May act in an autocrine and paracrine manner (PubMed:25335547, PubMed:7721806). Upon binding to the PLA2R1 receptor can regulate podocyte survival and glomerular homeostasis (PubMed:25335547). Has anti-helminth activity in a process regulated by gut microbiota. Upon helminth infection of intestinal epithelia, directly affects phosphatidylethanolamine contents in the membrane of helminth larvae, likely controlling an array of phospholipid-mediated cellular processes such as membrane fusion and cell division while providing for better immune recognition, ultimately reducing larvae integrity and infectivity (By similarity).
