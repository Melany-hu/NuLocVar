UniprotID	P62304
Accession	P62304;B2R5B9;P08578;Q15498;Q5BKT2
EntryName	RUXE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein E (snRNP-E) (Sm protein E) (Sm-E) (SmE)
GeneName	SNRPE
Length	92
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing as a core component of the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:18984161, PubMed:19325628, PubMed:23246290, PubMed:23333303, PubMed:25555158, PubMed:26912367, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:28781166, PubMed:32494006). Component of both the pre-catalytic spliceosome B complex and activated spliceosome C complexes (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:28781166). As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (PubMed:15146077). As part of the U7 snRNP it is involved in histone 3'-end processing (PubMed:12975319).
