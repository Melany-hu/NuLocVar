UniprotID	O96007
Accession	O96007;Q6IAI3
EntryName	MOC2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Molybdopterin synthase catalytic subunit (EC 2.8.1.12) (MOCO1-B) (Molybdenum cofactor synthesis protein 2 large subunit) (Molybdenum cofactor synthesis protein 2B) (MOCS2B) (Molybdopterin-synthase large subunit) (MPT synthase large subunit)
GeneName	MOCS2 MCBPE MOCO1
Length	188
Function	Catalytic subunit of the molybdopterin synthase complex, a complex that catalyzes the conversion of precursor Z into molybdopterin. Acts by mediating the incorporation of 2 sulfur atoms from thiocarboxylated MOCS2A into precursor Z to generate a dithiolene group.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol
