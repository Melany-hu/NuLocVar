EntryName	TUSC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase subunit TUSC3 (Oligosaccharyl transferase subunit TUSC3) (Magnesium uptake/transporter TUSC3) (Protein N33) (Tumor suppressor candidate 3)
GeneName	TUSC3 N33
Length	348
Function	Acts as accessory component of the N-oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) complex which catalyzes the transfer of a high mannose oligosaccharide from a lipid-linked oligosaccharide donor to an asparagine residue within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif in nascent polypeptide chains. Involved in N-glycosylation of STT3B-dependent substrates. Specifically required for the glycosylation of a subset of acceptor sites that are near cysteine residues; in this function seems to act redundantly with MAGT1. In its oxidized form proposed to form transient mixed disulfides with a glycoprotein substrate to facilitate access of STT3B to the unmodified acceptor site. Also has oxidoreductase-independent functions in the STT3B-containing OST complex possibly involving substrate recognition. Could indirectly play a role in Mg(2+) transport (PubMed:19717468).
