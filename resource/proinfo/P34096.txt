UniprotID	P34096
Accession	P34096
EntryName	RNAS4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease 4 (RNase 4) (EC 3.1.27.-)
GeneName	RNASE4 RNS4
Length	147
Function	Cleaves preferentially after uridine bases (PubMed:3467790). Has antimicrobial activity against uropathogenic E.coli (UPEC) (PubMed:33818125). Probably contributes to urinary tract sterility (PubMed:33818125).
