UniprotID	P28067
Accession	P28067;Q29639;Q29640
EntryName	DMA_HUMAN
ProteinName	HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DM alpha chain (MHC class II antigen DMA) (Really interesting new gene 6 protein)
GeneName	HLA-DMA DMA RING6
Length	261
Function	Plays a critical role in catalyzing the release of class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) from newly synthesized MHC class II molecules and freeing the peptide binding site for acquisition of antigenic peptides. In B-cells, the interaction between HLA-DM and MHC class II molecules is regulated by HLA-DO.
Subcellular Location	Late endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane
