UniprotID	Q8TAD8
Accession	Q8TAD8;Q96SP9;Q9H9T7
EntryName	SNIP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Smad nuclear-interacting protein 1 (FHA domain-containing protein SNIP1)
GeneName	SNIP1
Length	396
Function	Required for pre-mRNA splicing as component of the spliceosome (PubMed:29360106). As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (Probable). Down-regulates NF-kappa-B signaling by competing with RELA for CREBBP/EP300 binding. Involved in the microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. May be involved in cyclin-D1/CCND1 mRNA stability through the SNARP complex which associates with both the 3'end of the CCND1 gene and its mRNA.
