EntryName	SGMR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sigma intracellular receptor 2 (S2R) (Sigma-2 receptor) (Sigma2 receptor) (Meningioma-associated protein 30) (MAC30) (Transmembrane protein 97)
GeneName	TMEM97 MAC30 S2R
Length	176
Function	Sigma-2 receptor which contributes to ameliorate dysfunctional cellular processes and slow degenerative progression by regulating cell functions including cholesterol biosynthesis/trafficking, membrane trafficking, autophagy, lipid membrane-bound protein trafficking, and receptor stabilization at the cell surface (Probable) (PubMed:19583955, PubMed:23922215, PubMed:25620095, PubMed:27378690, PubMed:28559337, PubMed:30443021, PubMed:34233061, PubMed:34799735, PubMed:35970844). Forms a ternary complex with PGRMC1 receptor and low density lipoprotein receptor/LDLR at the plasma membrane, which increases LDLR-mediated LDL cholesterol internalization (PubMed:30443021). Decreases lysosomal sterol transporter NPC1 availability to the cell, probably through NPC1-binding, hence controlling lipid transport, including cholesterol and LBPA, outside of late endosome/lysosome (PubMed:19583955, PubMed:27378690). Binds regio- and stereoselective ligand 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol (20(S)-OHC) which enhances TMEM97-NPC1 interaction and decreases TMEM97-PGRMC1 and TMEM97-TSPO interactions, thereby linking OHC binding to cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:34799735, PubMed:37047353). Also able to bind cholesterol (By similarity). Binds histatin 1 (Hst 1)/HN1 salivary peptide at the ER membrane, which is critical for increasing mitochondria-ER contacts and stimulating Hst1 wound healing properties (PubMed:34233061, PubMed:35970844). May alter the activity of some cytochrome P450 proteins (PubMed:22292588). Although shows homologies with sterol isomerases (EXPERA domain), not able to catalyze sterol isomerization (Probable) (PubMed:34880501). However, may act as sensors of these molecules (Probable) (PubMed:34880501). Acts as a quality control factor in the ER, promoting the proteolytic degradation of nonproductive and extramitochondrial precursor proteins in the ER membrane thus removing them from the ER surface (By similarity).
