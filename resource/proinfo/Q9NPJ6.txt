UniprotID	Q9NPJ6
Accession	Q9NPJ6;B4DX67;Q53GB4;Q53H68;Q5T912;Q6FHC4;Q6IA79;Q9BS95;Q9NYR5
EntryName	MED4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 4 (Activator-recruited cofactor 36 kDa component) (ARC36) (Mediator complex subunit 4) (TRAP/SMCC/PC2 subunit p36 subunit) (Vitamin D3 receptor-interacting protein complex 36 kDa component) (DRIP36)
GeneName	MED4 ARC36 DRIP36 VDRIP HSPC126
Length	270
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
