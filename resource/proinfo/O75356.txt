ProteinName	Nucleoside diphosphate phosphatase ENTPD5 (EC 3.6.1.6) (CD39 antigen-like 4) (ER-UDPase) (Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 5) (NTPDase 5) (Guanosine-diphosphatase ENTPD5) (GDPase ENTPD5) (Inosine diphosphate phosphatase ENTPD5) (Nucleoside diphosphatase) (Uridine-diphosphatase ENTPD5) (UDPase ENTPD5)
GeneName	ENTPD5 CD39L4 PCPH
Length	428
Function	Hydrolyzes nucleoside diphosphates with a preference for GDP, IDP and UDP compared to ADP and CDP (PubMed:10400613, PubMed:15698960). In the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, hydrolyzes UDP that acts as an end-product feedback inhibitor of the UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferases. UMP can be transported back by an UDP-sugar antiporter to the cytosol where it is consumed to regenerate UDP-glucose. Therefore, it positively regulates protein reglucosylation by clearing UDP from the ER lumen and by promoting the regeneration of UDP-glucose. Protein reglucosylation is essential to proper glycoprotein folding and quality control in the ER (By similarity).
