UniprotID	Q9NPC8
Accession	Q9NPC8;Q9BXH7
EntryName	SIX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein SIX2 (Sine oculis homeobox homolog 2)
GeneName	SIX2
Length	291
Function	Transcription factor that plays an important role in the development of several organs, including kidney, skull and stomach. During kidney development, maintains cap mesenchyme multipotent nephron progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state by opposing the inductive signals emanating from the ureteric bud and cooperates with WNT9B to promote renewing progenitor cells proliferation. Acts through its interaction with TCF7L2 and OSR1 in a canonical Wnt signaling independent manner preventing transcription of differentiation genes in cap mesenchyme such as WNT4. Also acts independently of OSR1 to activate expression of many cap mesenchyme genes, including itself, GDNF and OSR1. During craniofacial development plays a role in growth and elongation of the cranial base through regulation of chondrocyte differentiation. During stomach organogenesis, controls pyloric sphincter formation and mucosal growth through regulation of a gene network including NKX2-5, BMPR1B, BMP4, SOX9 and GREM1. During branchial arch development, acts to mediate HOXA2 control over the insulin-like growth factor pathway. May also be involved in limb tendon and ligament development (By similarity). Plays a role in cell proliferation and migration.
