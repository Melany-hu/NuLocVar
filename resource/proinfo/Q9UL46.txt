UniprotID	Q9UL46
Accession	Q9UL46;Q15129
EntryName	PSME2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteasome activator complex subunit 2 (11S regulator complex subunit beta) (REG-beta) (Activator of multicatalytic protease subunit 2) (Proteasome activator 28 subunit beta) (PA28b) (PA28beta)
GeneName	PSME2
Length	239
Function	Implicated in immunoproteasome assembly and required for efficient antigen processing. The PA28 activator complex enhances the generation of class I binding peptides by altering the cleavage pattern of the proteasome.
