UniprotID	Q96AH0
Accession	Q96AH0;Q658Y8;Q9H5X6
EntryName	SOSB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	SOSS complex subunit B2 (Nucleic acid-binding protein 1) (Oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold-containing protein 2A) (Sensor of single-strand DNA complex subunit B2) (Sensor of ssDNA subunit B2) (SOSS-B2) (Single-stranded DNA-binding protein 2) (hSSB2)
GeneName	NABP1 OBFC2A SSB2
Length	204
Function	Component of the SOSS complex, a multiprotein complex that functions downstream of the MRN complex to promote DNA repair and G2/M checkpoint. In the SOSS complex, acts as a sensor of single-stranded DNA that binds to single-stranded DNA, in particular to polypyrimidines. The SOSS complex associates with DNA lesions and influences diverse endpoints in the cellular DNA damage response including cell-cycle checkpoint activation, recombinational repair and maintenance of genomic stability. Required for efficient homologous recombination-dependent repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and ATM-dependent signaling pathways.
