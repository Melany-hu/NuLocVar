UniprotID	P83369
Accession	P83369;A0AVQ1;Q7Z7P0;Q8N975
EntryName	LSM11_HUMAN
ProteinName	U7 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein LSm11
GeneName	LSM11
Length	360
Function	Component of the U7 snRNP complex that is involved in the histone 3'-end pre-mRNA processing (PubMed:11574479, PubMed:16914750, PubMed:33230297). Increases U7 snRNA levels but not histone 3'-end pre-mRNA processing activity, when overexpressed (PubMed:11574479, PubMed:16914750). Required for cell cycle progression from G1 to S phases (By similarity). Binds specifically to the Sm-binding site of U7 snRNA (PubMed:11574479, PubMed:16914750).
