UniprotID	Q9HBU9
Accession	Q9HBU9;Q86UE7
EntryName	POPD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Popeye domain-containing protein 2 (Popeye protein 2)
GeneName	POPDC2 POP2
Length	364
Function	Important for the maintenance of cardiac function. Plays a regulatory function in heart rate dynamics mediated, at least in part, through cAMP-binding and, probably, by increasing cell surface expression of the potassium channel KCNK2 and enhancing current density.
