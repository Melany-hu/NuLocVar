UniprotID	P08319
Accession	P08319;A8K470;B4DIE7;C9J4A9;Q8TCD7
EntryName	ADH4_HUMAN
ProteinName	All-trans-retinol dehydrogenase [NAD(+)] ADH4 (EC 1.1.1.105) (Alcohol dehydrogenase 2) (Alcohol dehydrogenase 4) (Alcohol dehydrogenase class II pi chain)
GeneName	ADH4 ADH2
Length	380
Function	Catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of either all-trans-retinol or 9-cis-retinol (PubMed:17279314). Also oxidizes long chain omega-hydroxy fatty acids, such as 20-HETE, producing both the intermediate aldehyde, 20-oxoarachidonate and the end product, a dicarboxylic acid, (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenedioate (PubMed:16081420). Also catalyzes the reduction of benzoquinones (PubMed:10514444).
