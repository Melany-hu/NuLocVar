EntryName	BANP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein BANP (BEN domain-containing protein 1) (Btg3-associated nuclear protein) (Scaffold/matrix-associated region-1-binding protein)
GeneName	BANP BEND1 SMAR1
Length	519
Function	Controls V(D)J recombination during T-cell development by repressing T-cell receptor (TCR) beta enhancer function (By similarity). Binds to scaffold/matrix attachment region beta (S/MARbeta), an ATC-rich DNA sequence located upstream of the TCR beta enhancer (By similarity). Represses cyclin D1 transcription by recruiting HDAC1 to its promoter, thereby diminishing H3K9ac, H3S10ph and H4K8ac levels (PubMed:16166625). Promotes TP53 activation, which causes cell cycle arrest (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of alternative splicing (PubMed:26080397). Binds to CD44 pre-mRNA and negatively regulates the inclusion of CD44 proximal variable exons v2-v6 but has no effect on distal variable exons v7-v10 (PubMed:26080397).
