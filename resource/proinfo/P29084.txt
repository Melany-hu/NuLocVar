UniprotID	P29084
Accession	P29084;D3DSV2;Q9H2B9
EntryName	T2EB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription initiation factor IIE subunit beta (TFIIE-beta) (General transcription factor IIE subunit 2)
GeneName	GTF2E2 TF2E2
Length	291
Function	Recruits TFIIH to the initiation complex and stimulates the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities of TFIIH. Both TFIIH and TFIIE are required for promoter clearance by RNA polymerase.
