UniprotID	Q5VTH2
Accession	Q5VTH2
EntryName	FLTOP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Flattop (Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 126)
GeneName	CFAP126 C1orf192 FLTP
Length	177
Function	Microtubule inner protein (MIP) part of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in cilia axoneme (PubMed:36191189). Acts as a regulator of cilium basal body docking and positioning in mono- and multiciliated cells (By similarity). Regulates basal body docking and cilia formation in multiciliated lung cells (By similarity). Regulates kinocilium positioning and stereocilia bundle morphogenesis in the inner ear (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium basal body; Cell projection; Cilium; Apical cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium axoneme; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Flagellum axoneme
