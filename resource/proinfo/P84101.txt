UniprotID	P84101
Accession	P84101;A6NL45;B5MCG1;B9A026;O75918;O88891;Q9BZH7
EntryName	SERF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small EDRK-rich factor 2 (Gastric cancer-related protein VRG107) (Protein 4F5-related) (4F5rel) (h4F5rel)
GeneName	SERF2 FAM2C
Length	59
Function	Positive regulator of amyloid protein aggregation and proteotoxicity (PubMed:20723760). Induces conformational changes in amyloid proteins, such as HTT, driving them into compact formations preceding the formation of aggregates (PubMed:20723760).
