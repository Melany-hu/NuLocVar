EntryName	ATAD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Outer mitochondrial transmembrane helix translocase (EC 7.4.2.-) (ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 1) (hATAD1) (Thorase)
GeneName	ATAD1 FNP001
Length	361
Function	Outer mitochondrial translocase required to remove mislocalized tail-anchored transmembrane proteins on mitochondria (PubMed:24843043). Specifically recognizes and binds tail-anchored transmembrane proteins: acts as a dislocase that mediates the ATP-dependent extraction of mistargeted tail-anchored transmembrane proteins from the mitochondrion outer membrane (By similarity). Also plays a critical role in regulating the surface expression of AMPA receptors (AMPAR), thereby regulating synaptic plasticity and learning and memory (By similarity). Required for NMDA-stimulated AMPAR internalization and inhibition of GRIA1 and GRIA2 recycling back to the plasma membrane; these activities are ATPase-dependent (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane; Peroxisome membrane; Postsynaptic cell membrane
