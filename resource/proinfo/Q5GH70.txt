ProteinName	XK-related protein 9 (hXKR9) [Cleaved into: XK-related protein 9, processed form]
GeneName	XKR9 XRG9
Length	373
Function	Phospholipid scramblase that promotes phosphatidylserine exposure on apoptotic cell surface (PubMed:25231987). Phosphatidylserine is a specific marker only present at the surface of apoptotic cells and acts as a specific signal for engulfment (PubMed:25231987).
