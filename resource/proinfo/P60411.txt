UniprotID	P60411
Accession	P60411;A2RRG1;A6NIR9;Q70LJ1
EntryName	KR109_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 10-9 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.9) (Keratin-associated protein 10.9) (Keratin-associated protein 18-9) (Keratin-associated protein 18.9)
GeneName	KRTAP10-9 KAP10.9 KAP18-9 KRTAP10.9 KRTAP18-9 KRTAP18.9
Length	292
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
