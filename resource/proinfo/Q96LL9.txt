UniprotID	Q96LL9
Accession	Q96LL9;Q9BSG8
EntryName	DJC30_HUMAN
ProteinName	DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 30, mitochondrial (Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosomal region 18 protein)
GeneName	DNAJC30 WBSCR18
Length	226
Function	Mitochondrial protein enriched in neurons that acts as a regulator of mitochondrial respiration (By similarity). Associates with the ATP synthase complex and facilitates ATP synthesis (By similarity). May be a chaperone protein involved in the turnover of the subunits of mitochondrial complex I N-module. It facilitates the degradation of N-module subunits damaged by oxidative stress, and contributes to complex I functional efficiency (PubMed:33465056).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
