EntryName	TOLIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Toll-interacting protein
GeneName	TOLLIP
Length	274
Function	Component of the signaling pathway of IL-1 and Toll-like receptors (PubMed:10854325, PubMed:11751856). Inhibits cell activation by microbial products. Recruits IRAK1 to the IL-1 receptor complex (PubMed:10854325). Inhibits IRAK1 phosphorylation and kinase activity (PubMed:11751856). Connects the ubiquitin pathway to autophagy by functioning as a ubiquitin-ATG8 family adapter and thus mediating autophagic clearance of ubiquitin conjugates (PubMed:25042851). The TOLLIP-dependent selective autophagy pathway plays an important role in clearance of cytotoxic polyQ proteins aggregates (PubMed:25042851). In a complex with TOM1, recruits ubiquitin-conjugated proteins onto early endosomes (PubMed:15047686). Binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) (PubMed:26320582).
