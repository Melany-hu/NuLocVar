EntryName	DPEP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dipeptidase 3
GeneName	DPEP3 UNQ834/PRO1772
Length	488
Function	Lacks dipeptidase activity and is unable to hydrolyze cystinyl-bis-glycine, leukotriene D4 and the beta-lactam antibiotic imipenem (PubMed:32325220). The absence of activity may be due to the inability of asparagine (instead of aspartate found in DPEP1/2) at position 359 to function as the acid/base catalyst and activate the nucleophilic water/hydroxide (PubMed:32325220). A tyrosine (instead of histidine) at position 269 reduces affinity for the beta zinc and may cause substrate steric hindrance (PubMed:32325220).
