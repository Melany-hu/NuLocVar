UniprotID	Q9H2H8
Accession	Q9H2H8;Q86WF9;Q96IA9;Q9BXZ1
EntryName	PPIL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase-like 3 (PPIase) (EC 5.2.1.8) (Cyclophilin J) (CyPJ) (Cyclophilin-like protein PPIL3) (Rotamase PPIL3)
GeneName	PPIL3
Length	161
Function	PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides. May be involved in pre-mRNA splicing.
