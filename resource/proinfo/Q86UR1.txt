UniprotID	Q86UR1
Accession	Q86UR1;O60533;Q29VU9;Q29VV0;Q2TAM1;Q8IUS3
EntryName	NOXA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADPH oxidase activator 1 (NOX activator 1) (Antigen NY-CO-31) (NCF2-like protein) (P67phox-like factor) (p51-nox)
GeneName	NOXA1 P51NOX
Length	476
Function	Functions as an activator of NOX1, a superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase. Functions in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which participate in a variety of biological processes including host defense, hormone biosynthesis, oxygen sensing and signal transduction. May also activate CYBB/gp91phox and NOX3.
