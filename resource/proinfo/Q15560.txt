UniprotID	Q15560
Accession	Q15560;B3KNM1;Q8TD37;Q8TD38
EntryName	TCEA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription elongation factor A protein 2 (Testis-specific S-II) (Transcription elongation factor S-II protein 2) (Transcription elongation factor TFIIS.l)
GeneName	TCEA2
Length	299
Function	Necessary for efficient RNA polymerase II transcription elongation past template-encoded arresting sites. The arresting sites in DNA have the property of trapping a certain fraction of elongating RNA polymerases that pass through, resulting in locked ternary complexes. Cleavage of the nascent transcript by S-II allows the resumption of elongation from the new 3'-terminus.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
