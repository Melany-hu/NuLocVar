UniprotID	P56556
Accession	P56556;B2RE54;O43675;Q6FGW0;Q6IBT8;Q6IC39
EntryName	NDUA6_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 6 (Complex I-B14) (CI-B14) (LYR motif-containing protein 6) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B14 subunit)
GeneName	NDUFA6 LYRM6 NADHB14
Length	128
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed to be not involved in catalysis. Required for proper complex I assembly (PubMed:30245030). Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
