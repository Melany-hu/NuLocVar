UniprotID	O75593
Accession	O75593;D3DWM4
EntryName	FOXH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Forkhead box protein H1 (Forkhead activin signal transducer 1) (Fast-1) (hFAST-1) (Forkhead activin signal transducer 2) (Fast-2)
GeneName	FOXH1 FAST1 FAST2
Length	365
Function	Transcriptional activator. Recognizes and binds to the DNA sequence 5'-TGTATT-3'. Required for induction of the goosecoid (GSC) promoter by TGF-beta or activin signaling. Forms a transcriptionally active complex containing FOXH1/SMAD2/SMAD4 on a site on the GSC promoter called TARE (TGF-beta/activin response element).
