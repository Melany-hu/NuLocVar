UniprotID	Q01892
Accession	Q01892;A8K9C9;B4DUG6;Q15359
EntryName	SPIB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor Spi-B
GeneName	SPIB
Length	262
Function	Sequence specific transcriptional activator which binds to the PU-box, a purine-rich DNA sequence (5'-GAGGAA-3') that can act as a lymphoid-specific enhancer. Promotes development of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), also known as type 2 DC precursors (pre-DC2) or natural interferon (IFN)-producing cells. These cells have the capacity to produce large amounts of interferon and block viral replication. May be required for B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, which is necessary for normal B-cell development and antigenic stimulation.
