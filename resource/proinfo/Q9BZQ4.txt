EntryName	NMNA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMN/NaMN adenylyltransferase 2) (EC 2.7.7.1) (EC 2.7.7.18) (Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2) (NMN adenylyltransferase 2) (Nicotinate-nucleotide adenylyltransferase 2) (NaMN adenylyltransferase 2)
GeneName	NMNAT2 C1orf15 KIAA0479
Length	307
Function	Nicotinamide/nicotinate-nucleotide adenylyltransferase that acts as an axon maintenance factor (By similarity). Axon survival factor required for the maintenance of healthy axons: acts by delaying Wallerian axon degeneration, an evolutionarily conserved process that drives the loss of damaged axons (By similarity). Catalyzes the formation of NAD(+) from nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and ATP (PubMed:16118205, PubMed:17402747). Can also use the deamidated form; nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) as substrate but with a lower efficiency (PubMed:16118205, PubMed:17402747). Cannot use triazofurin monophosphate (TrMP) as substrate (PubMed:16118205, PubMed:17402747). Also catalyzes the reverse reaction, i.e. the pyrophosphorolytic cleavage of NAD(+) (PubMed:16118205, PubMed:17402747). For the pyrophosphorolytic activity prefers NAD(+), NADH and NaAD as substrates and degrades nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NHD) less effectively (PubMed:16118205, PubMed:17402747). Fails to cleave phosphorylated dinucleotides NADP(+), NADPH and NaADP(+) (PubMed:16118205, PubMed:17402747). Also acts as an activator of ADP-ribosylation by supporting the catalytic activity of PARP16 and promoting mono-ADP-ribosylation of ribosomes by PARP16 (PubMed:34314702).
