EntryName	RNF25_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF25 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 25) (RING finger protein AO7)
GeneName	RNF25
Length	459
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a key role in the RNF14-RNF25 translation quality control pathway, a pathway that takes place when a ribosome has stalled during translation, and which promotes ubiquitination and degradation of translation factors on stalled ribosomes (PubMed:36638793, PubMed:37651229, PubMed:37951216). Catalyzes ubiquitination of RPS27A in response to ribosome collisions, promoting activation of RNF14 (PubMed:36638793). RNF25 catalyzes ubiquitination of other ribosomal proteins on stalled ribosomes, such as RPL0, RPL1, RPL12, RPS13 and RPS17 (PubMed:36638793). Also involved in ubiquitination and degradation of stalled ETF1/eRF1 (PubMed:36638793, PubMed:37651229). Independently of its function in the response to stalled ribosomes, mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of NKD2 (By similarity). May also stimulate transcription mediated by NF-kappa-B via its interaction with RELA/p65 (PubMed:12748188).
