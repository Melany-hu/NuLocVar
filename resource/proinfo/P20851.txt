UniprotID	P20851
Accession	P20851;A5JYP8;D3DT81;Q5VVR0;Q9BS25
EntryName	C4BPB_HUMAN
ProteinName	C4b-binding protein beta chain
GeneName	C4BPB
Length	252
Function	Controls the classical pathway of complement activation. It binds as a cofactor to C3b/C4b inactivator (C3bINA), which then hydrolyzes the complement fragment C4b. It also accelerates the degradation of the C4bC2a complex (C3 convertase) by dissociating the complement fragment C2a. It also interacts with anticoagulant protein S and with serum amyloid P component. The beta chain binds protein S.
