EntryName	MACD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribose glycohydrolase MACROD2 (MACRO domain-containing protein 2) (O-acetyl-ADP-ribose deacetylase MACROD2) (EC 3.5.1.-) ([Protein ADP-ribosylaspartate] hydrolase MACROD2) (EC 3.2.2.-) ([Protein ADP-ribosylglutamate] hydrolase MACROD2) (EC 3.2.2.-)
GeneName	MACROD2 C20orf133
Length	425
Function	Removes ADP-ribose from aspartate and glutamate residues in proteins bearing a single ADP-ribose moiety (PubMed:23474712, PubMed:23474714). Inactive towards proteins bearing poly-ADP-ribose (PubMed:23474712, PubMed:23474714). Deacetylates O-acetyl-ADP ribose, a signaling molecule generated by the deacetylation of acetylated lysine residues in histones and other proteins (PubMed:21257746).
