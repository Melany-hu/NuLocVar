UniprotID	P51679
Accession	P51679;Q9ULY6;Q9ULY7
EntryName	CCR4_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C chemokine receptor type 4 (C-C CKR-4) (CC-CKR-4) (CCR-4) (CCR4) (K5-5) (CD antigen CD194)
GeneName	CCR4 CMKBR4
Length	360
Function	High affinity receptor for the C-C type chemokines CCL17/TARC, CCL22/MDC and CKLF isoform 1/CKLF1. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G(i) proteins which activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Can function as a chemoattractant homing receptor on circulating memory lymphocytes and as a coreceptor for some primary HIV-2 isolates. In the CNS, could mediate hippocampal-neuron survival.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
