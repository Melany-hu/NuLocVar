UniprotID	P67812
Accession	P67812;B2RAD7;B4DUL4;H0YK72;H0YK83;O75957;P21378;Q53FQ8
EntryName	SC11A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal peptidase complex catalytic subunit SEC11A (EC 3.4.21.89) (Endopeptidase SP18) (Microsomal signal peptidase 18 kDa subunit) (SPase 18 kDa subunit) (SEC11 homolog A) (SEC11-like protein 1) (SPC18)
GeneName	SEC11A SEC11L1 SPC18 SPCS4A
Length	179
Function	Catalytic component of the signal peptidase complex (SPC) which catalyzes the cleavage of N-terminal signal sequences from nascent proteins as they are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:34388369). Specifically cleaves N-terminal signal peptides that contain a hydrophobic alpha-helix (h-region) shorter than 18-20 amino acids (PubMed:34388369).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
