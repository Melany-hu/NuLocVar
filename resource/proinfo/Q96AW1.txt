UniprotID	Q96AW1
Accession	Q96AW1;B0AZU1;B2RAT4;B3KS72;C9JWR3;Q6FIE3;Q8NBN8;Q96RE5;Q9H0W4
EntryName	VOPP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	WW domain binding protein VOPP1 (EGFR-coamplified and overexpressed protein) (ECop) (Glioblastoma-amplified secreted protein) (Putative NF-kappa-B-activating protein 055N) (Vesicular, overexpressed in cancer, prosurvival protein 1)
GeneName	VOPP1 ECOP GASP
Length	172
Function	Increases the transcriptional activity of NFKB1 by facilitating its nuclear translocation, DNA-binding and associated apoptotic response, when overexpressed (PubMed:15735698). May sequester WWOX in lysosomal vesicles and thereby regulate WWOX role as tumor suppressor (PubMed:30285739).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Late endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane
