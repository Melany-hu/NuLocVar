UniprotID	Q86X19
Accession	Q86X19;Q53QP7;Q53R98
EntryName	TMM17_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 17
GeneName	TMEM17
Length	198
Function	Transmembrane component of the tectonic-like complex, a complex localized at the transition zone of primary cilia and acting as a barrier that prevents diffusion of transmembrane proteins between the cilia and plasma membranes. Required for ciliogenesis and sonic hedgehog/SHH signaling (By similarity).
