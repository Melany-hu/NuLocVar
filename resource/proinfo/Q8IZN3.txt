UniprotID	Q8IZN3
Accession	Q8IZN3;A6NDB7;Q5JS07;Q5JS08;Q6PHS4;Q8IZN2;Q9H7F1
EntryName	ZDH14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC14 (EC 2.3.1.225) (DHHC domain-containing cysteine-rich protein 14) (DHHC-14) (NEW1 domain-containing protein) (NEW1CP) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 14)
GeneName	ZDHHC14
Length	488
Function	Palmitoyltransferase that could catalyze the addition of palmitate onto various protein substrates. May have a palmitoyltransferase activity toward the beta-2 adrenergic receptor/ADRB2 and thereby regulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling (PubMed:27481942). May play a role in cell differentiation and apoptosis (PubMed:21151021, PubMed:24407904).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack membrane
