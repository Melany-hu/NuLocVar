UniprotID	Q9Y617
Accession	Q9Y617;Q5T7G5;Q5T7G6;Q96AW2;Q9BQ12
EntryName	SERC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphoserine aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.52) (Phosphohydroxythreonine aminotransferase) (PSAT)
GeneName	PSAT1 PSA
Length	370
Function	Involved in L-serine biosynthesis via the phosphorylated pathway, a three-step pathway converting the glycolytic intermediate 3-phospho-D-glycerate into L-serine. Catalyzes the second step, that is the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent transamination of 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate and L-glutamate to O-phosphoserine (OPS) and alpha-ketoglutarate.
