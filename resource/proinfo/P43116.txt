UniprotID	P43116
Accession	P43116;D3DSC0;Q52LG8
EntryName	PE2R2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP2 subtype (PGE receptor EP2 subtype) (PGE2 receptor EP2 subtype) (Prostanoid EP2 receptor)
GeneName	PTGER2
Length	358
Function	Receptor for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The activity of this receptor is mediated by G(s) proteins that stimulate adenylate cyclase. The subsequent raise in intracellular cAMP is responsible for the relaxing effect of this receptor on smooth muscle.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
