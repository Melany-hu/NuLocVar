UniprotID	Q9Y5X4
Accession	Q9Y5X4;B6ZGU0;Q9UHM4
EntryName	NR2E3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Photoreceptor-specific nuclear receptor (Nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group E member 3) (Retina-specific nuclear receptor)
GeneName	NR2E3 PNR RNR
Length	410
Function	Orphan nuclear receptor of retinal photoreceptor cells. Transcriptional factor that is an activator of rod development and repressor of cone development. Binds the promoter region of a number of rod- and cone-specific genes, including rhodopsin, M- and S-opsin and rod-specific phosphodiesterase beta subunit. Enhances rhodopsin expression. Represses M- and S-cone opsin expression.
