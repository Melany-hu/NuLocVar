UniprotID	P61086
Accession	P61086;A6NJC1;A8K5Y9;B2RDF8;C9JGP1;O54806;P27924;Q16721;Q9CVV9;Q9Y2D3
EntryName	UBE2K_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 K (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme K) (Huntingtin-interacting protein 2) (HIP-2) (Ubiquitin carrier protein) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25 kDa) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2(25K)) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase)
GeneName	UBE2K HIP2 LIG
Length	200
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. In vitro, in the presence or in the absence of BRCA1-BARD1 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, catalyzes the synthesis of 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains. Does not transfer ubiquitin directly to but elongates monoubiquitinated substrate protein. Mediates the selective degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins, such as the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded lumenal proteins. Ubiquitinates huntingtin. May mediate foam cell formation by the suppression of apoptosis of lipid-bearing macrophages through ubiquitination and subsequence degradation of p53/TP53. Proposed to be involved in ubiquitination and proteolytic processing of NF-kappa-B; in vitro supports ubiquitination of NFKB1. In case of infection by cytomegaloviruses may be involved in the US11-dependent degradation of MHC class I heavy chains following their export from the ER to the cytosol. In case of viral infections may be involved in the HPV E7 protein-dependent degradation of RB1.
