EntryName	PO2F3_HUMAN
ProteinName	POU domain, class 2, transcription factor 3 (Octamer-binding protein 11) (Oct-11) (Octamer-binding transcription factor 11) (OTF-11) (Transcription factor PLA-1) (Transcription factor Skn-1)
GeneName	POU2F3 OTF11 PLA1
Length	436
Function	Transcription factor that binds to the octamer motif (5'-ATTTGCAT-3') and regulates cell type-specific differentiation pathways. Involved in the regulation of keratinocytes differentiation (PubMed:11329378). The POU2F3-POU2AF2/POU2AF3 complex drives the expression of tuft-cell-specific genes, a rare chemosensory cells that coordinate immune and neural functions within mucosal epithelial tissues (PubMed:35576971).
