UniprotID	Q9Y258
Accession	Q9Y258;A0N0Q5;Q52LV8
EntryName	CCL26_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 26 (CC chemokine IMAC) (Eotaxin-3) (Macrophage inflammatory protein 4-alpha) (MIP-4-alpha) (Small-inducible cytokine A26) (Thymic stroma chemokine-1) (TSC-1)
GeneName	CCL26 SCYA26 UNQ216/PRO242
Length	94
Function	Chemoattractant for eosinophils and basophils (PubMed:10415065, PubMed:10488147). Acts as a ligand for C-C chemokine receptor CCR3 which triggers Ca(2+) mobilization in eosinophils (PubMed:10415065, PubMed:10488147, PubMed:11425309). Also acts as a ligand for CX3C chemokine receptor CX3CR1, inducing cell chemotaxis (PubMed:20974991).
