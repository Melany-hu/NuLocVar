UniprotID	O43665
Accession	O43665;A8K408;B1AMR8;Q6IAZ6;Q96GN0
EntryName	RGS10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 10 (RGS10)
GeneName	RGS10
Length	181
Function	Regulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades, including signaling downstream of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor CHRM2. Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits, thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form (PubMed:10608901, PubMed:11443111, PubMed:18434541, PubMed:8774883, PubMed:9353196). Modulates the activity of potassium channels that are activated in response to CHRM2 signaling (PubMed:11443111). Activity on GNAZ is inhibited by palmitoylation of the G-protein (PubMed:9353196).
