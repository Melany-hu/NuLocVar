UniprotID	P26196
Accession	P26196;Q5D048
EntryName	DDX6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX6 (EC 3.6.4.13) (ATP-dependent RNA helicase p54) (DEAD box protein 6) (Oncogene RCK)
GeneName	DDX6 HLR2 RCK
Length	483
Function	Essential for the formation of P-bodies, cytosolic membrane-less ribonucleoprotein granules involved in RNA metabolism through the coordinated storage of mRNAs encoding regulatory functions (PubMed:25995375, PubMed:27342281, PubMed:31422817). Plays a role in P-bodies to coordinate the storage of translationally inactive mRNAs in the cytoplasm and prevent their degradation (PubMed:27342281). In the process of mRNA degradation, plays a role in mRNA decapping (PubMed:16364915). Blocks autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions by repressing the expression of ATG-related genes through degradation of their transcripts (PubMed:26098573).
