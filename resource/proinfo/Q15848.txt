UniprotID	Q15848
Accession	Q15848;Q58EX9
EntryName	ADIPO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adiponectin (30 kDa adipocyte complement-related protein) (Adipocyte complement-related 30 kDa protein) (ACRP30) (Adipocyte, C1q and collagen domain-containing protein) (Adipose most abundant gene transcript 1 protein) (apM-1) (Gelatin-binding protein)
GeneName	ADIPOQ ACDC ACRP30 APM1 GBP28
Length	244
Function	Important adipokine involved in the control of fat metabolism and insulin sensitivity, with direct anti-diabetic, anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. Stimulates AMPK phosphorylation and activation in the liver and the skeletal muscle, enhancing glucose utilization and fatty-acid combustion. Antagonizes TNF-alpha by negatively regulating its expression in various tissues such as liver and macrophages, and also by counteracting its effects. Inhibits endothelial NF-kappa-B signaling through a cAMP-dependent pathway. May play a role in cell growth, angiogenesis and tissue remodeling by binding and sequestering various growth factors with distinct binding affinities, depending on the type of complex, LMW, MMW or HMW.
