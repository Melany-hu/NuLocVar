UniprotID	A6NMT0
Accession	A6NMT0
EntryName	DBX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein DBX1 (Developing brain homeobox protein 1)
GeneName	DBX1
Length	343
Function	Could have a role in patterning the central nervous system during embryogenesis. Has a key role in regulating the distinct phenotypic features that distinguish two major classes of ventral interneurons, V0 and V1 neurons. Regulates the transcription factor profile, neurotransmitter phenotype, intraspinal migratory path and axonal trajectory of V0 neurons, features that differentiate them from an adjacent set of V1 neurons (By similarity).
