UniprotID	Q6UWZ7
Accession	Q6UWZ7;A5JJ07;Q9H8I1;Q9H9N4
EntryName	ABRX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	BRCA1-A complex subunit Abraxas 1 (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 98) (Protein FAM175A)
GeneName	ABRAXAS1 ABRA1 CCDC98 FAM175A UNQ496/PRO1013
Length	409
Function	Involved in DNA damage response and double-strand break (DSB) repair. Component of the BRCA1-A complex, acting as a central scaffold protein that assembles the various components of the complex and mediates the recruitment of BRCA1. The BRCA1-A complex specifically recognizes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2AX at DNA lesion sites, leading to target the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer to sites of DNA damage at DSBs. This complex also possesses deubiquitinase activity that specifically removes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin on histones H2A and H2AX.
