UniprotID	Q7RTP0
Accession	Q7RTP0;B2RA76;Q5HYA9;Q7KZB0;Q86XW4
EntryName	NIPA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Magnesium transporter NIPA1 (Non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region protein 1) (Spastic paraplegia 6 protein)
GeneName	NIPA1 SPG6
Length	329
Function	Acts as a Mg(2+) transporter. Can also transport other divalent cations such as Fe(2+), Sr(2+), Ba(2+), Zn(2+) and Co(2+) but to a much less extent than Mg(2+) (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Early endosome
