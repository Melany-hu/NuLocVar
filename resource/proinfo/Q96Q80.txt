EntryName	DERL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Derlin-3 (Degradation in endoplasmic reticulum protein 3) (DERtrin-3) (Der1-like protein 3)
GeneName	DERL3 C22orf14 DER3 LLN2
Length	235
Function	Functional component of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) for misfolded lumenal glycoproteins, but not that of misfolded nonglycoproteins. May act by forming a channel that allows the retrotranslocation of misfolded glycoproteins into the cytosol where they are ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. May mediate the interaction between VCP and the misfolded glycoproteins (PubMed:16449189, PubMed:22607976). May be involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced pre-emptive quality control, a mechanism that selectively attenuates the translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and reroutes them to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (PubMed:26565908).
