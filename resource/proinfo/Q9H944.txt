UniprotID	Q9H944
Accession	Q9H944;B4DE08;O95821;Q5T8J4;Q9Y429
EntryName	MED20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 20 (Mediator complex subunit 20) (TRF-proximal protein homolog) (hTRFP)
GeneName	MED20 TRFP
Length	212
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
