UniprotID	Q9Y696
Accession	Q9Y696;Q9UFW9;Q9UQJ6
EntryName	CLIC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chloride intracellular channel protein 4 (Glutaredoxin-like oxidoreductase CLIC4) (EC 1.8.-.-) (Intracellular chloride ion channel protein p64H1)
GeneName	CLIC4
Length	253
Function	In the soluble state, catalyzes glutaredoxin-like thiol disulfide exchange reactions with reduced glutathione as electron donor (PubMed:25581026, PubMed:37759794). Can insert into membranes and form voltage-dependent multi-ion conductive channels. Membrane insertion seems to be redox-regulated and may occur only under oxidizing conditions (By similarity) (PubMed:16176272). Has alternate cellular functions like a potential role in angiogenesis or in maintaining apical-basolateral membrane polarity during mitosis and cytokinesis. Could also promote endothelial cell proliferation and regulate endothelial morphogenesis (tubulogenesis). Promotes cell-surface expression of HRH3.
