UniprotID	O94907
Accession	O94907;B2RC19
EntryName	DKK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dickkopf-1) (Dkk-1) (hDkk-1) (SK)
GeneName	DKK1 UNQ492/PRO1008
Length	266
Function	Antagonizes canonical Wnt signaling by inhibiting LRP5/6 interaction with Wnt and by forming a ternary complex with the transmembrane protein KREMEN that promotes internalization of LRP5/6 (PubMed:22000856). DKKs play an important role in vertebrate development, where they locally inhibit Wnt regulated processes such as antero-posterior axial patterning, limb development, somitogenesis and eye formation. In the adult, Dkks are implicated in bone formation and bone disease, cancer and Alzheimer disease (PubMed:17143291). Inhibits the pro-apoptotic function of KREMEN1 in a Wnt-independent manner, and has anti-apoptotic activity (By similarity).
