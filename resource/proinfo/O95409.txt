UniprotID	O95409
Accession	O95409;Q5VYA9;Q9H309
EntryName	ZIC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein ZIC 2 (Zinc finger protein of the cerebellum 2)
GeneName	ZIC2
Length	532
Function	Acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor. Plays important roles in the early stage of organogenesis of the CNS. Activates the transcription of the serotonin transporter SERT in uncrossed ipsilateral retinal ganglion cells (iRGCs) to refine eye-specific projections in primary visual targets. Its transcriptional activity is repressed by MDFIC. Involved in the formation of the ipsilateral retinal projection at the optic chiasm midline. Drives the expression of EPHB1 on ipsilaterally projecting growth cones. Binds to the minimal GLI-consensus sequence 5'-TGGGTGGTC-3'. Associates to the basal SERT promoter region from ventrotemporal retinal segments of retinal embryos.
