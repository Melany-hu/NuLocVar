UniprotID	Q8TBE9
Accession	Q8TBE9;B3KP12;Q5JYN8;Q8TE97;Q9Y3N0
EntryName	NANP_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.29) (Haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase domain-containing protein 4) (HDHD4) (N-acetylneuraminate-9-phosphate phosphatase) (Neu5Ac-9-Pase)
GeneName	NANP C20orf147 HDHD4
Length	248
Function	Catalyzes the dephosphorylation of N-acylneuraminate 9-phosphate (Neu5Ac-9-P) to N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac or sialic acid) (PubMed:14235556, PubMed:16237198, PubMed:23747226). Can also use N-glycoloylneuraminate 9-phosphate as substrate (PubMed:14235556).
