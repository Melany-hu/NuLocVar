UniprotID	Q9H7M9
Accession	Q9H7M9;A1L0X9;A4ZYV1;A8MVH5;Q6UXF3;Q8WUG3;Q8WYZ8
EntryName	VISTA_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type immunoglobulin domain-containing suppressor of T-cell activation (Platelet receptor Gi24) (Stress-induced secreted protein-1) (Sisp-1) (V-set domain-containing immunoregulatory receptor) (V-set immunoregulatory receptor)
GeneName	VSIR C10orf54 SISP1 VISTA PP2135 UNQ730/PRO1412
Length	311
Function	Immunoregulatory receptor which inhibits the T-cell response (PubMed:24691993). May promote differentiation of embryonic stem cells, by inhibiting BMP4 signaling (By similarity). May stimulate MMP14-mediated MMP2 activation (PubMed:20666777).
