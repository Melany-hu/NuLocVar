UniprotID	P24593
Accession	P24593;Q5U0A3
EntryName	IBP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5 (IBP-5) (IGF-binding protein 5) (IGFBP-5)
GeneName	IGFBP5 IBP5
Length	272
Function	Multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in regulating the availability of IGFs to their receptors and thereby regulates IGF-mediated cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in a cell-type specific manner (PubMed:18930415, PubMed:7683690). Increases the cell proliferation of osteoblasts, intestinal smooth muscle cells and neuroblastoma cells. Enhances adhesion and survival of epithelial cells but decreases adhesion of mesenchymal cells (By similarity). Once secreted, acts as a major mediator of mTORC1-dependent feedback inhibition of IGF1 signaling (By similarity). Also plays a role in the induction of extracellular matrix (ECM) production and deposition independently of its nuclear translocation and binding to IGFs (PubMed:20345844, PubMed:26103640). Acts itself as a growth factor that can act independently of IGFs to regulate bone formation. Acts as a ligand for the ROR1 receptor which triggers formation of ROR1/HER2 heterodimer to enhance CREB oncogenic signaling (PubMed:36949068).
