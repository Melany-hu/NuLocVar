Accession	Q9H7H0;Q9BSH1;Q9BZH2;Q9BZH3
EntryName	MET17_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosome assembly protein METTL17, mitochondrial (False p73 target gene protein) (Methyltransferase 11 domain-containing protein 1) (Methyltransferase-like protein 17) (Protein RSM22 homolog, mitochondrial)
GeneName	METTL17 METT11D1
Length	456
Function	Mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) assembly factor (PubMed:36482135, PubMed:38199006). Binds at the interface of the head and body domains of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mt-SSU), occluding the mRNA channel and preventing compaction of the head domain towards the body (PubMed:36482135). Probable inactive methyltransferase: retains the characteristic folding and ability to bind S-adenosyl-L-methionine, but it probably lost its methyltransferase activity (PubMed:38234605).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
