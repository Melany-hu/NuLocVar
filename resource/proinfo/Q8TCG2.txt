UniprotID	Q8TCG2
Accession	Q8TCG2;Q9NUW2
EntryName	P4K2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type 2-beta (EC 2.7.1.67) (Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type II-beta) (PI4KII-BETA)
GeneName	PI4K2B
Length	481
Function	Together with PI4K2A and the type III PI4Ks (PIK4CA and PIK4CB) it contributes to the overall PI4-kinase activity of the cell (PubMed:11923287, PubMed:12324459). This contribution may be especially significant in plasma membrane, endosomal and Golgi compartments (PubMed:11923287, PubMed:12324459). The phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) to PI4P is the first committed step in the generation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a precursor of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) (PubMed:11923287, PubMed:12324459). Contributes to the production of InsP3 in stimulated cells and is likely to be involved in the regulation of vesicular trafficking.
