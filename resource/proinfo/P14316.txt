UniprotID	P14316
Accession	P14316;D6RCK5;H0Y8S3;Q6IAS7;Q96B99
EntryName	IRF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2)
GeneName	IRF2
Length	349
Function	Specifically binds to the upstream regulatory region of type I IFN and IFN-inducible MHC class I genes (the interferon consensus sequence (ICS)) and represses those genes. Also acts as an activator for several genes including H4 and IL7. Constitutively binds to the ISRE promoter to activate IL7. Involved in cell cycle regulation through binding the site II (HiNF-M) promoter region of H4 and activating transcription during cell growth. Antagonizes IRF1 transcriptional activation.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
