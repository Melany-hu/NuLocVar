EntryName	NSF1C_HUMAN
ProteinName	NSFL1 cofactor p47 (UBX domain-containing protein 2C) (p97 cofactor p47)
GeneName	NSFL1C UBXN2C
Length	370
Function	Reduces the ATPase activity of VCP (By similarity). Necessary for the fragmentation of Golgi stacks during mitosis and for VCP-mediated reassembly of Golgi stacks after mitosis (By similarity). May play a role in VCP-mediated formation of transitional endoplasmic reticulum (tER) (By similarity). Inhibits the activity of CTSL (in vitro) (PubMed:15498563). Together with UBXN2B/p37, regulates the centrosomal levels of kinase AURKA/Aurora A during mitotic progression by promoting AURKA removal from centrosomes in prophase (PubMed:23649807). Also, regulates spindle orientation during mitosis (PubMed:23649807).
