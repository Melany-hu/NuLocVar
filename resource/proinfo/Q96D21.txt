UniprotID	Q96D21
Accession	Q96D21;O95520;Q5THY8
EntryName	RHES_HUMAN
ProteinName	GTP-binding protein Rhes (Ras homolog enriched in striatum) (Tumor endothelial marker 2)
GeneName	RASD2 TEM2
Length	266
Function	GTPase signaling protein that binds to and hydrolyzes GTP. Regulates signaling pathways involving G-proteins-coupled receptor and heterotrimeric proteins such as GNB1, GNB2 and GNB3. May be involved in selected striatal competencies, mainly locomotor activity and motor coordination.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
