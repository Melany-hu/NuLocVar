UniprotID	P06744
Accession	P06744;B4DG39;Q9BRD3;Q9BSK5;Q9UHE6
EntryName	G6PI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) (EC 5.3.1.9) (Autocrine motility factor) (AMF) (Neuroleukin) (NLK) (Phosphoglucose isomerase) (PGI) (Phosphohexose isomerase) (PHI) (Sperm antigen 36) (SA-36)
GeneName	GPI
Length	558
Function	In the cytoplasm, catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, the second step in glycolysis, and the reverse reaction during gluconeogenesis (PubMed:28803808). Besides it's role as a glycolytic enzyme, also acts as a secreted cytokine: acts as an angiogenic factor (AMF) that stimulates endothelial cell motility (PubMed:11437381). Acts as a neurotrophic factor, neuroleukin, for spinal and sensory neurons (PubMed:11004567, PubMed:3352745). It is secreted by lectin-stimulated T-cells and induces immunoglobulin secretion (PubMed:11004567, PubMed:3352745).
