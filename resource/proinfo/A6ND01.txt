UniprotID	A6ND01
Accession	A6ND01
EntryName	JUNO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sperm-egg fusion protein Juno (Folate receptor 4) (Folate receptor delta) (FR-delta) (IZUMO1 receptor protein JUNO)
GeneName	IZUMO1R FOLR4 JUNO
Length	250
Function	Receptor for IZUMO1 present at the cell surface of oocytes (oolemma), which is essential for species-specific gamete recognition and fertilization. The IZUMO1:IZUMO1R/JUNO interaction is a necessary adhesion event between sperm and egg that is required for fertilization but is not sufficient for cell fusion (PubMed:30517645). The ligand-receptor interaction probably does not act as a membrane 'fusogen'. Does not bind folate.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell projection; Microvillus membrane
