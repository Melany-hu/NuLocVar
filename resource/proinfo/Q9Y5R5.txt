UniprotID	Q9Y5R5
Accession	Q9Y5R5;B1ANC0;B9EGJ1;Q9NPG6;Q9NQR6
EntryName	DMRT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Doublesex- and mab-3-related transcription factor 2 (Doublesex-like 2 protein) (DSXL-2)
GeneName	DMRT2 DSXL2
Length	561
Function	Transcriptional activator that directly regulates early activation of the myogenic determination gene MYF5 by binding in a sequence-specific manner to the early epaxial enhancer element of it. Involved in somitogenesis during embryogenesis and somite development and differentiation into sclerotome and dermomyotome. Required for the initiation and/or maintenance of proper organization of the sclerotome, dermomyotome and myotome (By similarity).
