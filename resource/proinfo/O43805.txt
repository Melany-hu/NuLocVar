UniprotID	O43805
Accession	O43805;Q5VSG0;Q6FG70;Q9BVW8
EntryName	SSNA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Microtubule nucleation factor SSNA1 (Nuclear autoantigen of 14 kDa) (Sjoegren syndrome nuclear autoantigen 1)
GeneName	SSNA1 NA14
Length	119
Function	Microtubule-binding protein which stabilizes dynamic microtubules by slowing growth and shrinkage at both plus and minus ends and serves as a sensor of microtubule damage, protecting microtubules from the microtubule-severing enzyme SPAST (PubMed:34970964). Induces microtubule branching which is mediated by the formation of long SSNA1 fibrils which guide microtubule protofilaments to split apart from the mother microtubule and form daughter microtubules (By similarity). Plays a role in axon outgrowth and branching (PubMed:25390646). Required for cell division (PubMed:25390646).
