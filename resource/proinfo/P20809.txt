UniprotID	P20809
Accession	P20809;B4DQV5;Q96EB4
EntryName	IL11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-11 (IL-11) (Adipogenesis inhibitory factor) (AGIF) (Oprelvekin)
GeneName	IL11
Length	199
Function	Cytokine that stimulates the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocyte progenitor cells and induces megakaryocyte maturation resulting in increased platelet production (PubMed:2145578). Also promotes the proliferation of hepatocytes in response to liver damage. Binding to its receptor formed by IL6ST and IL11RA activates a signaling cascade that promotes cell proliferation (PubMed:12919066). Signaling leads to the activation of intracellular protein kinases and the phosphorylation of STAT3. The interaction with the membrane-bound IL11RA and IL6ST stimulates 'classic signaling', whereas the binding of IL11 and soluble IL11RA to IL6ST stimulates 'trans-signaling' (PubMed:30279168).
