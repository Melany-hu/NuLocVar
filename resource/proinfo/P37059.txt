UniprotID	P37059
Accession	P37059;B2R7T4
EntryName	DHB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (17-beta-HSD 2) (20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) (20-alpha-HSD) (E2DH) (Estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase 2) (EC 1.1.1.62) (Microsomal 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 2) (Testosterone 17-beta-dehydrogenase) (EC 1.1.1.239)
GeneName	HSD17B2 EDH17B2 SDR9C2
Length	387
Function	Catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of the highly active 17beta-hydroxysteroids, such as estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), to their less active forms and thus regulates the biological potency of these steroids. Oxidizes estradiol to estrone, testosterone to androstenedione, and dihydrotestosterone to 5alpha-androstan-3,17-dione. Also has 20-alpha-HSD activity.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
