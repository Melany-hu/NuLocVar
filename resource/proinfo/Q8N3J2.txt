EntryName	METL4_HUMAN
ProteinName	N(6)-adenine-specific methyltransferase METTL4 (Methyltransferase-like protein 4) (N(6)-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase METTL4) (EC 2.1.1.72) (snRNA (2'-O-methyladenosine-N(6)-)-methyltransferase METTL4) (EC 2.1.1.-)
GeneName	METTL4
Length	472
Function	N(6)-adenine-specific methyltransferase that can methylate both RNAs and DNA (PubMed:31913360, PubMed:32183942). Acts as a N(6)-adenine-specific RNA methyltransferase by catalyzing formation of N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6A(m)) on internal positions of U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA): methylates the 6th position of adenine residues with a pre-deposited 2'-O-methylation (PubMed:31913360). Internal m6A(m) methylation of snRNAs regulates RNA splicing (PubMed:31913360). Also able to act as a N(6)-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase by mediating methylation of DNA on the 6th position of adenine (N(6)-methyladenosine) (PubMed:32183942). The existence of N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) on DNA is however unclear in mammals, and additional evidences are required to confirm the role of the N(6)-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase activity of METTL4 in vivo (PubMed:32203414). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial transcript levels and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number by mediating mtDNA N(6)-methylation: m6A on mtDNA reduces transcription by repressing TFAM DNA-binding and bending (PubMed:32183942). N(6)-methyladenosine deposition by METTL4 regulates Polycomb silencing by triggering ubiquitination and degradation of sensor proteins ASXL1 and MPND, leading to inactivation of the PR-DUB complex and subsequent preservation of Polycomb silencing (By similarity).
