UniprotID	Q16698
Accession	Q16698;B7Z6B8;Q2M304;Q93085
EntryName	DECR_HUMAN
ProteinName	2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase [(3E)-enoyl-CoA-producing], mitochondrial (EC 1.3.1.124) (2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase [NADPH]) (4-enoyl-CoA reductase [NADPH]) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 18C member 1)
GeneName	DECR1 DECR SDR18C1
Length	335
Function	Auxiliary enzyme of beta-oxidation. It participates in the metabolism of unsaturated fatty enoyl-CoA esters having double bonds in both even- and odd-numbered positions in mitochondria. Catalyzes the NADP-dependent reduction of 2,4-dienoyl-CoA to yield trans-3-enoyl-CoA.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
