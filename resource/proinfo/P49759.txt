UniprotID	P49759
Accession	P49759;B4DFW7;Q0P694;Q8N5V8
EntryName	CLK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity protein kinase CLK1 (EC 2.7.12.1) (CDC-like kinase 1)
GeneName	CLK1 CLK
Length	484
Function	Dual specificity kinase acting on both serine/threonine and tyrosine-containing substrates. Phosphorylates serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins of the spliceosomal complex and may be a constituent of a network of regulatory mechanisms that enable SR proteins to control RNA splicing. Phosphorylates: SRSF1, SRSF3 and PTPN1 (PubMed:10480872, PubMed:19168442). Regulates the alternative splicing of tissue factor (F3) pre-mRNA in endothelial cells (PubMed:19168442).
