UniprotID	Q96AQ8
Accession	Q96AQ8;Q96JS7;Q9H7F8
EntryName	MCUR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulator 1 (MCU regulator 1) (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 90A, mitochondrial)
GeneName	MCUR1 C6orf79 CCDC90A
Length	359
Function	Key regulator of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) required for calcium entry into mitochondrion (PubMed:23178883, PubMed:26445506, PubMed:26976564, PubMed:27184846). Plays a direct role in uniporter-mediated calcium uptake via a direct interaction with MCU (PubMed:23178883). Probably involved in the assembly of the membrane components of the uniporter complex (uniplex) (PubMed:27184846).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
