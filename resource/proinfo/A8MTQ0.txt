UniprotID	A8MTQ0
Accession	A8MTQ0;B4DJ59;B7ZAU5
EntryName	NOTO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein notochord
GeneName	NOTO
Length	251
Function	Transcription regulator acting downstream of both FOXA2 and Brachyury (T) during notochord development. Required for node morphogenesis. Is essential for cilia formation in the posterior notochord (PNC) and for left-right patterning; acts upstream of FOXJ1 and RFX3 in this process and is required for the expression of various components important for axonemal assembly and function. Plays a role in regulating axial versus paraxial cell fate. Activates the transcription of ciliary proteins C11orf97 homolog, FAM183B and SPACA9 in the embryonic ventral node (By similarity).
