UniprotID	Q16206
Accession	Q16206;A8K197;A8K1C2;Q5VTJ1;Q5VTJ2;Q8WUX0;Q9NTP6;Q9UH82
EntryName	ENOX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ecto-NOX disulfide-thiol exchanger 2 (APK1 antigen) (Cytosolic ovarian carcinoma antigen 1) (Tumor-associated hydroquinone oxidase) (tNOX) [Includes: Hydroquinone [NADH] oxidase (EC 1.-.-.-); Protein disulfide-thiol oxidoreductase (EC 1.-.-.-)]
GeneName	ENOX2 COVA1
Length	610
Function	May be involved in cell growth. Probably acts as a terminal oxidase of plasma electron transport from cytosolic NAD(P)H via hydroquinones to acceptors at the cell surface. Hydroquinone oxidase activity alternates with a protein disulfide-thiol interchange/oxidoreductase activity which may control physical membrane displacements associated with vesicle budding or cell enlargement. The activities oscillate with a period length of 22 minutes and play a role in control of the ultradian cellular biological clock.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted; Extracellular space
