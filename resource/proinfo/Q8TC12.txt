EntryName	RDH11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinol dehydrogenase 11 (EC 1.1.1.300) (Androgen-regulated short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase 1) (HCV core-binding protein HCBP12) (Prostate short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase 1) (Retinal reductase 1) (RalR1) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 7C member 1)
GeneName	RDH11 ARSDR1 PSDR1 SDR7C1 CGI-82
Length	318
Function	Retinol dehydrogenase with a clear preference for NADP. Displays high activity towards 9-cis, 11-cis and all-trans-retinol, and to a lesser extent on 13-cis-retinol (PubMed:12036956, PubMed:12226107, PubMed:29410696). Exhibits a low reductive activity towards unsaturated medium-chain aldehydes such as cis -6-nonenal and no activity toward nonanal or 4-hydroxy-nonenal (PubMed:15865448). Has no dehydrogenase activity towards steroid (PubMed:12036956, PubMed:12226107).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
