ProteinName	Polyunsaturated fatty acid 5-lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.-) (Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase) (5-LO) (5-lipoxygenase) (EC 1.13.11.34)
GeneName	ALOX5 LOG5
Length	674
Function	Catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonate ((5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoate) to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoate (5-HPETE) followed by the dehydration to 5,6- epoxyeicosatetraenoate (Leukotriene A4/LTA4), the first two steps in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, which are potent mediators of inflammation (PubMed:19022417, PubMed:21233389, PubMed:22516296, PubMed:23246375, PubMed:24282679, PubMed:24893149, PubMed:31664810, PubMed:8615788, PubMed:8631361). Also catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonate into 8-hydroperoxyicosatetraenoate (8-HPETE) and 12-hydroperoxyicosatetraenoate (12-HPETE) (PubMed:23246375). Displays lipoxin synthase activity being able to convert (15S)-HETE into a conjugate tetraene (PubMed:31664810). Although arachidonate is the preferred substrate, this enzyme can also metabolize oxidized fatty acids derived from arachidonate such as (15S)-HETE, eicosapentaenoate (EPA) such as (18R)- and (18S)-HEPE or docosahexaenoate (DHA) which lead to the formation of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) lipoxin and resolvins E and D respectively, therefore it participates in anti-inflammatory responses (PubMed:17114001, PubMed:21206090, PubMed:31664810, PubMed:32404334, PubMed:8615788). Oxidation of DHA directly inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) (By similarity). It does not catalyze the oxygenation of linoleic acid and does not convert (5S)-HETE to lipoxin isomers (PubMed:31664810). In addition to inflammatory processes, it participates in dendritic cell migration, wound healing through an antioxidant mechanism based on heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) regulation expression, monocyte adhesion to the endothelium via ITGAM expression on monocytes (By similarity). Moreover, it helps establish an adaptive humoral immunity by regulating primary resting B cells and follicular helper T cells and participates in the CD40-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after CD40 ligation in B cells through interaction with PIK3R1 that bridges ALOX5 with CD40 (PubMed:21200133). May also play a role in glucose homeostasis, regulation of insulin secretion and palmitic acid-induced insulin resistance via AMPK (By similarity). Can regulate bone mineralization and fat cell differentiation increases in induced pluripotent stem cells (By similarity).
