Function	Mitochondrial serine transporter that mediates transport of serine into mitochondria, an important step of the one-carbon metabolism pathway (PubMed:30442778). Mitochondrial serine is converted to glycine and formate, which then exits to the cytosol where it is used to generate the charged folates that serve as one-carbon donors (PubMed:30442778).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion membrane
