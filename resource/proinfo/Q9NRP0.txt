EntryName	OSTC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Oligosaccharyltransferase complex subunit OSTC (Hydrophobic protein HSF-28)
GeneName	OSTC DC2 HDCMD45P HSPC307
Length	149
Function	Subunit of STT3A-containing oligosaccharyl transferase (OST-A) complex that catalyzes the initial transfer of a defined glycan (Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) in eukaryotes) from the lipid carrier dolichol-pyrophosphate to an asparagine residue within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif in nascent polypeptide chains, the first step in protein N-glycosylation (PubMed:28860277, PubMed:31831667, PubMed:39509507). N-glycosylation occurs cotranslationally and the complex associates with the Sec61 complex at the channel-forming translocon complex that mediates protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (PubMed:28860277, PubMed:31831667, PubMed:39509507). Within the OST-A complex, acts as an adapter that anchors the OST-A complex to the Sec61 complex (PubMed:28860277). May be involved in N-glycosylation of APP (amyloid-beta precursor protein) (PubMed:21768116). Can modulate gamma-secretase cleavage of APP by enhancing endoprotelysis of PSEN1 (PubMed:21768116).
