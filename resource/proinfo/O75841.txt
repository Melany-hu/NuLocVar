EntryName	UPK1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Uroplakin-1b (UP1b) (Tetraspanin-20) (Tspan-20) (Uroplakin Ib) (UPIb)
GeneName	UPK1B TSPAN20
Length	260
Function	Component of the asymmetric unit membrane (AUM); a highly specialized biomembrane elaborated by terminally differentiated urothelial cells. May play an important role in normal bladder epithelial physiology, possibly in regulating membrane permeability of superficial umbrella cells or in stabilizing the apical membrane through AUM/cytoskeletal interactions (By similarity).
