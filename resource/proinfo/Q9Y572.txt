EntryName	RIPK3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (EC 2.7.11.1) (RIP-like protein kinase 3) (Receptor-interacting protein 3) (RIP-3)
GeneName	RIPK3 RIP3
Length	518
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase that activates necroptosis and apoptosis, two parallel forms of cell death (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:22265413, PubMed:22265414, PubMed:22421439, PubMed:29883609, PubMed:32657447). Necroptosis, a programmed cell death process in response to death-inducing TNF-alpha family members, is triggered by RIPK3 following activation by ZBP1 (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:22265413, PubMed:22265414, PubMed:22421439, PubMed:29883609, PubMed:32298652). Activated RIPK3 forms a necrosis-inducing complex and mediates phosphorylation of MLKL, promoting MLKL localization to the plasma membrane and execution of programmed necrosis characterized by calcium influx and plasma membrane damage (PubMed:19524512, PubMed:19524513, PubMed:22265413, PubMed:22265414, PubMed:22421439, PubMed:25316792, PubMed:29883609). In addition to TNF-induced necroptosis, necroptosis can also take place in the nucleus in response to orthomyxoviruses infection: following ZBP1 activation, which senses double-stranded Z-RNA structures, nuclear RIPK3 catalyzes phosphorylation and activation of MLKL, promoting disruption of the nuclear envelope and leakage of cellular DNA into the cytosol (By similarity). Also regulates apoptosis: apoptosis depends on RIPK1, FADD and CASP8, and is independent of MLKL and RIPK3 kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylates RIPK1: RIPK1 and RIPK3 undergo reciprocal auto- and trans-phosphorylation (PubMed:19524513). In some cell types, also able to restrict viral replication by promoting cell death-independent responses (By similarity). In response to Zika virus infection in neurons, promotes a cell death-independent pathway that restricts viral replication: together with ZBP1, promotes a death-independent transcriptional program that modifies the cellular metabolism via up-regulation expression of the enzyme ACOD1/IRG1 and production of the metabolite itaconate (By similarity). Itaconate inhibits the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, generating a metabolic state in neurons that suppresses replication of viral genomes (By similarity). RIPK3 binds to and enhances the activity of three metabolic enzymes: GLUL, GLUD1, and PYGL (PubMed:19498109). These metabolic enzymes may eventually stimulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which could result in enhanced ROS production (PubMed:19498109).
