EntryName	ASIC5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bile acid-sensitive ion channel (BASIC) (Acid-sensing ion channel subunit family member 5) (Amiloride-sensitive cation channel 5, intestinal) (Human intestine Na(+) channel) (HINaC)
GeneName	ASIC5 ACCN5
Length	505
Function	Forms bile acid-gated sodium channels and may play a role in bile acid-dependent absorption and secretion by epithelial cells of the bile ducts (PubMed:10767424, PubMed:22735174). Displays high selectivity for sodium ions but can also permit the permeation of other cations (Probable). The gating could be indirect and the consequence of alterations of the membrane environment of the channel by bile acids (By similarity). As a sodium channel of type II unipolar brush cells of the vestibulocerebellum, controlling the electrical activity of these cells, could play a role in motor coordination and balance (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane; Cell membrane
