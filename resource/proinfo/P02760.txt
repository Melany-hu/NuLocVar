Function	Antioxidant and tissue repair protein with reductase, heme-binding and radical-scavenging activities. Removes and protects against harmful oxidants and repairs macromolecules in intravascular and extravascular spaces and in intracellular compartments (PubMed:11877257, PubMed:15683711, PubMed:22096585, PubMed:23157686, PubMed:23642167, PubMed:25698971, PubMed:32092412, PubMed:32823731). Intravascularly, plays a regulatory role in red cell homeostasis by preventing heme- and reactive oxygen species-induced cell damage. Binds and degrades free heme to protect fetal and adult red blood cells from hemolysis (PubMed:11877257, PubMed:32092412). Reduces extracellular methemoglobin, a Fe3+ (ferric) form of hemoglobin that cannot bind oxygen, back to the Fe2+ (ferrous) form deoxyhemoglobin, which has oxygen-carrying potential (PubMed:15683711). Upon acute inflammation, inhibits oxidation of low-density lipoprotein particles by MPO and limits vascular damage (PubMed:25698971). Extravascularly, protects from oxidation products formed on extracellular matrix structures and cell membranes. Catalyzes the reduction of carbonyl groups on oxidized collagen fibers and preserves cellular and extracellular matrix ultrastructures (PubMed:22096585, PubMed:23642167). Importantly, counteracts the oxidative damage at blood-placenta interface, preventing leakage of free fetal hemoglobin into the maternal circulation (PubMed:21356557). Intracellularly, has a role in maintaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis. Bound to complex I of the respiratory chain of mitochondria, may scavenge free radicals and preserve mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Protects renal tubule epithelial cells from heme-induced oxidative damage to mitochondria (PubMed:23157686, PubMed:32823731). Reduces cytochrome c from Fe3+ (ferric) to the Fe2+ (ferrous) state through formation of superoxide anion radicals in the presence of ascorbate or NADH/NADPH electron donor cofactors, ascorbate being the preferred cofactor (PubMed:15683711). Has a chaperone role in facilitating the correct folding of bikunin in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment (By similarity).
