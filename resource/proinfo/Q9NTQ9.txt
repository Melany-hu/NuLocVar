UniprotID	Q9NTQ9
Accession	Q9NTQ9;B3KQ82
EntryName	CXB4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gap junction beta-4 protein (Connexin-30.3) (Cx30.3)
GeneName	GJB4
Length	266
Function	Structural component of gap junctions (By similarity). Gap junctions are dodecameric channels that connect the cytoplasm of adjoining cells. They are formed by the docking of two hexameric hemichannels, one from each cell membrane (By similarity). Small molecules and ions diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell via the central pore (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell junction; Gap junction
