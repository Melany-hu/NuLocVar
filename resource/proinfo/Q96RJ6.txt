UniprotID	Q96RJ6
Accession	Q96RJ6;Q495K0
EntryName	FER3L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fer3-like protein (Basic helix-loop-helix protein N-twist) (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 31) (bHLHa31) (Nephew of atonal 3) (Neuronal twist)
GeneName	FERD3L BHLHA31 NATO3 NTWIST
Length	166
Function	Transcription factor that binds to the E-box and functions as inhibitor of transcription. DNA binding requires dimerization with an E protein. Inhibits transcription activation by ASCL1/MASH1 by sequestering E proteins (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
