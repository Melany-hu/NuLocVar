Function	Substrate-recognition component of a Cul2-RING (CRL2) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex of the DesCEND (destruction via C-end degrons) pathway, which recognizes a C-degron located at the extreme C terminus of target proteins, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:29779948, PubMed:33909987). The C-degron recognized by the DesCEND pathway is usually a motif of less than ten residues and can be present in full-length proteins, truncated proteins or proteolytically cleaved forms (PubMed:29779948, PubMed:33909987). The CRL2(KLHDC10) complex specifically recognizes proteins with a proline-glycine (Pro-Gly) or an alanine tail (CAT tail) at the C-terminus, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:29779948, PubMed:33909987). The CRL2(KLHDC10) complex is involved in the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway, which mediates the extraction of incompletely synthesized nascent chains from stalled ribosomes: CRL2(KLHDC10) acts downstream of NEMF and recognizes CAT tails associated with stalled nascent chains, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:33909987). Participates in the oxidative stress-induced cell death through MAP3K5 activation (PubMed:23102700). Inhibits PPP5C phosphatase activity on MAP3K5 (PubMed:23102700). Acts as a regulator of necroptosis (By similarity).
