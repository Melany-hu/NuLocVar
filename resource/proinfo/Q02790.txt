UniprotID	Q02790
Accession	Q02790;D3DUQ1;Q9UCP1;Q9UCV7
EntryName	FKBP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP4 (PPIase FKBP4) (EC 5.2.1.8) (51 kDa FK506-binding protein) (FKBP51) (52 kDa FK506-binding protein) (52 kDa FKBP) (FKBP-52) (59 kDa immunophilin) (p59) (FK506-binding protein 4) (FKBP-4) (FKBP59) (HSP-binding immunophilin) (HBI) (Immunophilin FKBP52) (Rotamase) [Cleaved into: Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP4, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	FKBP4 FKBP52
Length	459
Function	Immunophilin protein with PPIase and co-chaperone activities. Component of steroid receptors heterocomplexes through interaction with heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90). May play a role in the intracellular trafficking of heterooligomeric forms of steroid hormone receptors between cytoplasm and nuclear compartments. The isomerase activity controls neuronal growth cones via regulation of TRPC1 channel opening. Also acts as a regulator of microtubule dynamics by inhibiting MAPT/TAU ability to promote microtubule assembly. May have a protective role against oxidative stress in mitochondria.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Mitochondrion; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cell projection; Axon
