UniprotID	Q9BY60
Accession	Q9BY60
EntryName	GBRL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 3 (GABA(A) receptor-associated protein-like 3)
GeneName	GABARAPL3
Length	117
Function	Ubiquitin-like modifier involved in autophagosome formation. Whereas LC3s are involved in elongation of the phagophore membrane, the GABARAP/GATE-16 subfamily is essential for a later stage in autophagosome maturation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome membrane
