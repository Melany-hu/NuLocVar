UniprotID	Q9NP79
Accession	Q9NP79;B4DW55;E1P594;E7ETQ7;Q5TGM1;Q6IAE8;Q9H0R2;Q9H3K9;Q9P0Q0
EntryName	VTA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein VTA1 homolog (Dopamine-responsive gene 1 protein) (DRG-1) (LYST-interacting protein 5) (LIP5) (SKD1-binding protein 1) (SBP1)
GeneName	VTA1 C6orf55 HSPC228 My012
Length	307
Function	Involved in the endosomal multivesicular bodies (MVB) pathway. MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. Thought to be a cofactor of VPS4A/B, which catalyzes disassembles membrane-associated ESCRT-III assemblies. Involved in the sorting and down-regulation of EGFR (By similarity). Involved in HIV-1 budding.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Endosome membrane
