UniprotID	P59543
Accession	P59543;P59549;Q2HIZ4;Q496D8;Q645X9
EntryName	T2R20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 20 (Taste receptor type 2 member 49) (T2R49) (Taste receptor type 2 member 56) (T2R56)
GeneName	TAS2R20 TAS2R49
Length	309
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Membrane
