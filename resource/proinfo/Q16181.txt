EntryName	SEPT7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Septin-7 (CDC10 protein homolog)
GeneName	SEPTIN7 CDC10 SEPT7
Length	437
Function	Filament-forming cytoskeletal GTPase. Required for normal organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Required for normal progress through mitosis. Involved in cytokinesis. Required for normal association of CENPE with the kinetochore. Plays a role in ciliogenesis and collective cell movements. Forms a filamentous structure with SEPTIN12, SEPTIN6, SEPTIN2 and probably SEPTIN4 at the sperm annulus which is required for the structural integrity and motility of the sperm tail during postmeiotic differentiation (PubMed:25588830).
