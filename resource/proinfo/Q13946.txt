Accession	Q13946;A0AVH6;A8K436;A8K9G5;O15380;Q96T72
EntryName	PDE7A_HUMAN
ProteinName	High affinity 3',5'-cyclic-AMP phosphodiesterase 7A (EC 3.1.4.53) (HCP1) (TM22) (cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase 7A)
GeneName	PDE7A
Length	482
Function	Hydrolyzes the second messenger cAMP, which is a key regulator of many important physiological processes (PubMed:19350606, PubMed:8389765, PubMed:9195912). May have a role in muscle signal transduction (PubMed:9195912).
