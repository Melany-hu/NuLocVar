EntryName	ACTB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Actin, cytoplasmic 1 (EC 3.6.4.-) (Beta-actin) [Cleaved into: Actin, cytoplasmic 1, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	ACTB
Length	375
Function	Actin is a highly conserved protein that polymerizes to produce filaments that form cross-linked networks in the cytoplasm of cells (PubMed:25255767, PubMed:29581253). Actin exists in both monomeric (G-actin) and polymeric (F-actin) forms, both forms playing key functions, such as cell motility and contraction (PubMed:29581253). In addition to their role in the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, G- and F-actin also localize in the nucleus, and regulate gene transcription and motility and repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:29925947). Part of the ACTR1A/ACTB filament around which the dynactin complex is built. The dynactin multiprotein complex activates the molecular motor dynein for ultra-processive transport along microtubules (By similarity).
