UniprotID	Q6UXB2
Accession	Q6UXB2;A8KAC0
EntryName	CXL17_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-X-C motif chemokine 17 (6-Cys CXCL17) (Dendritic cell and monocyte chemokine-like protein) (DMC) (VEGF coregulated chemokine 1) [Cleaved into: 4-Cys CXCL17]
GeneName	CXCL17 VCC1 UNQ473/PRO842
Length	119
Function	Chemokine that acts as a chemoattractant for monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells (PubMed:16455961, PubMed:23115081). Plays a role in angiogenesis and possibly in the development of tumors (PubMed:16989774, PubMed:23115081). Acts as an anti-inflammatory in the stomach (PubMed:23115081). May play a role in the innate defense against infections (PubMed:17307946). Activates the C-X-C chemokine receptor GPR35 to induce a rapid and transient rise in the level of intracellular calcium ions (PubMed:25411203).
