Accession	Q5BKZ1;A8MYX1;B4DLN0;B4E179;Q5VW93;Q5VW94;Q5VW96;Q5VW97;Q6NSA2;Q7Z638;Q7Z6C2
EntryName	ZN326_HUMAN
ProteinName	DBIRD complex subunit ZNF326 (Zinc finger protein 326) (Zinc finger protein interacting with mRNPs and DBC1)
GeneName	ZNF326 ZIRD
Length	582
Function	Core component of the DBIRD complex, a multiprotein complex that acts at the interface between core mRNP particles and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and integrates transcript elongation with the regulation of alternative splicing: the DBIRD complex affects local transcript elongation rates and alternative splicing of a large set of exons embedded in (A + T)-rich DNA regions. May play a role in neuronal differentiation and is able to bind DNA and activate expression in vitro.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus matrix
