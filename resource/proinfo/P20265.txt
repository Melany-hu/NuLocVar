EntryName	PO3F2_HUMAN
ProteinName	POU domain, class 3, transcription factor 2 (Brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein 2) (Brain-2) (Brn-2) (Nervous system-specific octamer-binding transcription factor N-Oct-3) (Octamer-binding protein 7) (Oct-7) (Octamer-binding transcription factor 7) (OTF-7)
GeneName	POU3F2 BRN2 OCT7 OTF7
Length	443
Function	Transcription factor that plays a key role in neuronal differentiation (By similarity). Binds preferentially to the recognition sequence which consists of two distinct half-sites, ('GCAT') and ('TAAT'), separated by a non-conserved spacer region of 0, 2, or 3 nucleotides (By similarity). Acts as a transcriptional activator when binding cooperatively with SOX4, SOX11, or SOX12 to gene promoters (By similarity). The combination of three transcription factors, ASCL1, POU3F2/BRN2 and MYT1L, is sufficient to reprogram fibroblasts and other somatic cells into induced neuronal (iN) cells in vitro (By similarity). Acts downstream of ASCL1, accessing chromatin that has been opened by ASCL1, and promotes transcription of neuronal genes (By similarity).
