UniprotID	O75821
Accession	O75821;O14801;Q969U5
EntryName	EIF3G_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit G (eIF3g) (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 RNA-binding subunit) (eIF-3 RNA-binding subunit) (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 4) (eIF-3-delta) (eIF3 p42) (eIF3 p44)
GeneName	EIF3G EIF3S4
Length	320
Function	RNA-binding component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is required for several steps in the initiation of protein synthesis (PubMed:17581632, PubMed:25849773, PubMed:27462815). The eIF-3 complex associates with the 40S ribosome and facilitates the recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A, eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation (PubMed:17581632). The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression (PubMed:25849773). This subunit can bind 18S rRNA.
