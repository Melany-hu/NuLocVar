UniprotID	Q9Y324
Accession	Q9Y324;Q86TW8;Q8TBL8
EntryName	FCF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	rRNA-processing protein FCF1 homolog
GeneName	FCF1 C14orf111 CGI-35
Length	198
Function	Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleolus
