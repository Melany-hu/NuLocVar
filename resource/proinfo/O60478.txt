UniprotID	O60478
Accession	O60478;Q53EK7;Q5TAE6;Q6FHI3
EntryName	G137B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Integral membrane protein GPR137B (Transmembrane 7 superfamily member 1 protein)
GeneName	GPR137B TM7SF1
Length	399
Function	Lysosomal integral membrane protein that regulates the localization and activity of mTORC1, a signaling complex promoting cell growth in response to growth factors, energy levels, and amino acids (PubMed:31036939). Interacts with Rag GTPases and increases the lysosomial localization and activity of Rag GTPases and thereby regulates mTORC1 translocation and activity in lysosome (PubMed:31036939). Involved in the regulation of lysosomal morphology and autophagy (PubMed:31036939).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane
