EntryName	MITF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Class E basic helix-loop-helix protein 32) (bHLHe32)
GeneName	MITF BHLHE32
Length	526
Function	Transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of melanocyte survival and differentiation as well as melanosome biogenesis (PubMed:10587587, PubMed:22647378, PubMed:27889061, PubMed:9647758). Binds to M-boxes (5'-TCATGTG-3') and symmetrical DNA sequences (E-boxes) (5'-CACGTG-3') found in the promoter of pigmentation genes, such as tyrosinase (TYR) (PubMed:10587587, PubMed:22647378, PubMed:27889061, PubMed:9647758). Involved in the cellular response to amino acid availability by acting downstream of MTOR: in the presence of nutrients, MITF phosphorylation by MTOR promotes its inactivation (PubMed:36608670). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of MTOR induces MITF dephosphorylation, resulting in transcription factor activity (PubMed:36608670). Plays an important role in melanocyte development by regulating the expression of tyrosinase (TYR) and tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1) (PubMed:10587587, PubMed:22647378, PubMed:27889061, PubMed:9647758). Plays a critical role in the differentiation of various cell types, such as neural crest-derived melanocytes, mast cells, osteoclasts and optic cup-derived retinal pigment epithelium (PubMed:10587587, PubMed:22647378, PubMed:27889061, PubMed:9647758).
