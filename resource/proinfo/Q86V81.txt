UniprotID	Q86V81
Accession	Q86V81;O43672
EntryName	THOC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	THO complex subunit 4 (Tho4) (Ally of AML-1 and LEF-1) (Aly/REF export factor) (Transcriptional coactivator Aly/REF) (bZIP-enhancing factor BEF)
GeneName	ALYREF ALY BEF THOC4
Length	257
Function	Functions as an mRNA export adapter; component of the transcription/export (TREX) complex which is thought to couple mRNA transcription, processing and nuclear export, and specifically associates with spliced mRNA and not with unspliced pre-mRNA (PubMed:15833825, PubMed:15998806, PubMed:17190602). TREX is recruited to spliced mRNAs by a transcription-independent mechanism, binds to mRNA upstream of the exon-junction complex (EJC) and is recruited in a splicing- and cap-dependent manner to a region near the 5' end of the mRNA where it functions in mRNA export to the cytoplasm via the TAP/NXF1 pathway (PubMed:15833825, PubMed:15998806, PubMed:17190602). Involved in the nuclear export of intronless mRNA; proposed to be recruited to intronless mRNA by ATP-bound DDX39B (PubMed:17984224). Plays a key role in mRNP recognition and mRNA packaging by bridging the mRNP-bound EJC and the TREX core complex (PubMed:37020021). TREX recruitment occurs via an interaction between ALYREF/THOC4 and the cap-binding protein NCBP1 (PubMed:15833825, PubMed:15998806, PubMed:17190602, PubMed:37020021). Required for TREX complex assembly and for linking DDX39B to the cap-binding complex (CBC) (PubMed:15998806, PubMed:17984224, PubMed:37020021). Binds mRNA which is thought to be transferred to the NXF1-NXT1 heterodimer for export (TAP/NXF1 pathway) (PubMed:11675789, PubMed:11707413, PubMed:11979277, PubMed:15833825, PubMed:15998806, PubMed:17190602, PubMed:18364396, PubMed:22144908, PubMed:22893130, PubMed:23222130, PubMed:25662211). In conjunction with THOC5 functions in NXF1-NXT1 mediated nuclear export of HSP70 mRNA; both proteins enhance the RNA binding activity of NXF1 and are required for NXF1 localization to the nuclear rim (PubMed:19165146). Involved in mRNA export of C5-methylcytosine (m5C)-containing mRNAs: specifically recognizes and binds m5C mRNAs and mediates their nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling (PubMed:28418038). Acts as a chaperone and promotes the dimerization of transcription factors containing basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domains and thereby promotes transcriptional activation (PubMed:10488337). Involved in transcription elongation and genome stability (PubMed:12438613).
