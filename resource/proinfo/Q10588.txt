UniprotID	Q10588
Accession	Q10588;B2R6A2;Q1XII0;Q5U0K0;Q96EN3
EntryName	BST1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosyl cyclase/cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase 2 (EC 3.2.2.6) (ADP-ribosyl cyclase 2) (Bone marrow stromal cell antigen 1) (BST-1) (Cyclic ADP-ribose hydrolase 2) (cADPR hydrolase 2) (CD antigen CD157)
GeneName	BST1
Length	318
Function	Catalyzes both the synthesis of cyclic ADP-beta-D-ribose (cADPR) from NAD(+), and its hydrolysis to ADP-D-ribose (ADPR) (PubMed:7805847). Cyclic ADPR is known to serve as an endogenous second messenger that elicits calcium release from intracellular stores, and thus regulates the mobilization of intracellular calcium (Probable). May be involved in pre-B-cell growth (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
