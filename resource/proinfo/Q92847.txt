UniprotID	Q92847
Accession	Q92847;Q14D12;Q6ISR8;Q92848;Q96RJ7
EntryName	GHSR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1 (GHS-R) (GH-releasing peptide receptor) (GHRP) (Ghrelin receptor)
GeneName	GHSR
Length	366
Function	Receptor for ghrelin, coupled to G-alpha-11 proteins. Stimulates growth hormone secretion. Also binds other growth hormone releasing peptides (GHRP) (e.g. Met-enkephalin and GHRP-6) as well as non-peptide, low molecular weight secretagogues (e.g. L-692,429, MK-0677, adenosine).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
