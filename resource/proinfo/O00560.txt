UniprotID	O00560
Accession	O00560;B2R5Q7;B4DUH3;B7ZLN2;O00173;O43391;Q14CP2
EntryName	SDCB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Syntenin-1 (Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 9) (MDA-9) (Pro-TGF-alpha cytoplasmic domain-interacting protein 18) (TACIP18) (Scaffold protein Pbp1) (Syndecan-binding protein 1)
GeneName	SDCBP MDA9 SYCL
Length	298
Function	Multifunctional adapter protein involved in diverse array of functions including trafficking of transmembrane proteins, neuro and immunomodulation, exosome biogenesis, and tumorigenesis (PubMed:26291527). Positively regulates TGFB1-mediated SMAD2/3 activation and TGFB1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration in various cell types. May increase TGFB1 signaling by enhancing cell-surface expression of TGFR1 by preventing the interaction between TGFR1 and CAV1 and subsequent CAV1-dependent internalization and degradation of TGFR1 (PubMed:25893292). In concert with SDC1/4 and PDCD6IP, regulates exosome biogenesis (PubMed:22660413). Regulates migration, growth, proliferation, and cell cycle progression in a variety of cancer types (PubMed:26539120). In adherens junctions may function to couple syndecans to cytoskeletal proteins or signaling components. Seems to couple transcription factor SOX4 to the IL-5 receptor (IL5RA) (PubMed:11498591). May also play a role in vesicular trafficking (PubMed:11179419). Seems to be required for the targeting of TGFA to the cell surface in the early secretory pathway (PubMed:10230395).
