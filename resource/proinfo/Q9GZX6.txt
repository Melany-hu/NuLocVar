EntryName	IL22_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-22 (IL-22) (Cytokine Zcyto18) (IL-10-related T-cell-derived-inducible factor) (IL-TIF)
GeneName	IL22 ILTIF ZCYTO18 UNQ3099/PRO10096
Length	179
Function	Cytokine that plays a critical role in modulating tissue responses during inflammation (PubMed:17204547). Plays an essential role in the regeneration of epithelial cells to maintain barrier function after injury and for the prevention of further tissue damage (PubMed:17204547). Unlike most of the cytokines, has no effect on immune cells. Signals through a heterodimeric receptor composed of two subunits, the specific receptor IL22RA1 which is present on non-immune cells in many organs and the shared subunit IL10RB (PubMed:10875937, PubMed:18599299). Ligation of IL22RA1 with IL22 induces activation of the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and TYK2, which in turn activates STAT3. In turn, promotes cell survival and proliferation through STAT3, ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways (PubMed:25793261, PubMed:31311100). Promotes phosphorylation of GSK3B at 'Ser-9' and CTTN (By similarity). Promotes epithelial cell spreading (By similarity).
