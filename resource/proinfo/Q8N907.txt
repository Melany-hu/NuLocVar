UniprotID	Q8N907
Accession	Q8N907
EntryName	DAND5_HUMAN
ProteinName	DAN domain family member 5 (Cerberus-like protein 2) (Cerl-2) (Cysteine knot superfamily 1, BMP antagonist 3) (Gremlin-3)
GeneName	DAND5 CER2 CKTSF1B3 GREM3 SP1
Length	189
Function	Seems to play a role in the correct specification of the left-right axis. May antagonize NODAL and BMP4 signaling. Cystine knot-containing proteins play important roles during development, organogenesis, tissue growth and differentiation (By similarity).
