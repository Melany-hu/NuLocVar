UniprotID	Q8NBQ5
Accession	Q8NBQ5;Q96HF6;Q9UKU4
EntryName	DHB11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase 11 (EC 1.1.1.62) (17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 11) (17-beta-HSD 11) (17bHSD11) (17betaHSD11) (17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase XI) (17-beta-HSD XI) (17betaHSDXI) (Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-associated antigen HD-CL-03) (CTCL-associated antigen HD-CL-03) (Dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 8) (Retinal short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase 2) (retSDR2) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 16C member 2)
GeneName	HSD17B11 DHRS8 PAN1B SDR16C2 PSEC0029 UNQ207/PRO233
Length	300
Function	Can convert androstan-3-alpha,17-beta-diol (3-alpha-diol) to androsterone in vitro, suggesting that it may participate in androgen metabolism during steroidogenesis. May act by metabolizing compounds that stimulate steroid synthesis and/or by generating metabolites that inhibit it. Has no activity toward DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), or A-dione (4-androste-3,17-dione), and only a slight activity toward testosterone to A-dione. Tumor-associated antigen in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum; Lipid droplet
