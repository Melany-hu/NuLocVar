EntryName	MET16_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA N(6)-adenosine-methyltransferase METTL16 (EC 2.1.1.348) (Methyltransferase 10 domain-containing protein) (Methyltransferase-like protein 16) (U6 small nuclear RNA (adenine-(43)-N(6))-methyltransferase) (EC 2.1.1.346)
GeneName	METTL16 METT10D
Length	562
Function	RNA N6-methyltransferase that methylates adenosine residues at the N(6) position of a subset of RNAs and is involved in S-adenosyl-L-methionine homeostasis by regulating expression of MAT2A transcripts (PubMed:28525753, PubMed:30197297, PubMed:30197299, PubMed:33428944, PubMed:33930289). Able to N6-methylate a subset of mRNAs and U6 small nuclear RNAs (U6 snRNAs) (PubMed:28525753). In contrast to the METTL3-METTL14 heterodimer, only able to methylate a limited number of RNAs: requires both a 5'UACAGAGAA-3' nonamer sequence and a specific RNA structure (PubMed:28525753, PubMed:30197297, PubMed:30197299). Plays a key role in S-adenosyl-L-methionine homeostasis by mediating N6-methylation of MAT2A mRNAs, altering splicing of MAT2A transcripts: in presence of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, binds the 3'-UTR region of MAT2A mRNA and specifically N6-methylates the first hairpin of MAT2A mRNA, preventing recognition of their 3'-splice site by U2AF1/U2AF35, thereby inhibiting splicing and protein production of S-adenosylmethionine synthase (PubMed:28525753, PubMed:33930289). In S-adenosyl-L-methionine-limiting conditions, binds the 3'-UTR region of MAT2A mRNA but stalls due to the lack of a methyl donor, preventing N6-methylation and promoting expression of MAT2A (PubMed:28525753). In addition to mRNAs, also able to mediate N6-methylation of U6 small nuclear RNA (U6 snRNA): specifically N6-methylates adenine in position 43 of U6 snRNAs (PubMed:28525753, PubMed:29051200, PubMed:32266935). Also able to bind various lncRNAs, such as 7SK snRNA (7SK RNA) or 7SL RNA (PubMed:29051200). Specifically binds the 3'-end of the MALAT1 long non-coding RNA (PubMed:27872311).
