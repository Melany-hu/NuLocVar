UniprotID	P41220
Accession	P41220;Q6I9U5
EntryName	RGS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (RGS2) (Cell growth-inhibiting gene 31 protein) (G0/G1 switch regulatory protein 8)
GeneName	RGS2 G0S8 GIG31
Length	211
Function	Regulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades. Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits, thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form (PubMed:11063746, PubMed:19478087). It is involved in the negative regulation of the angiotensin-activated signaling pathway (PubMed:28784619). Plays a role in the regulation of blood pressure in response to signaling via G protein-coupled receptors and GNAQ. Plays a role in regulating the constriction and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle (By similarity). Binds EIF2B5 and blocks its activity, thereby inhibiting the translation of mRNA into protein (PubMed:19736320).
