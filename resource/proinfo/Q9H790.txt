EntryName	EXO5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Exonuclease V (Exo V) (hExo5) (EC 3.1.-.-) (Defects in morphology protein 1 homolog)
GeneName	EXO5 C1orf176 DEM1
Length	373
Function	Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) bidirectional exonuclease involved in DNA repair. Probably involved in DNA repair following ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and interstrand cross-links (ICLs) damage. Has both 5'-3' and 3'-5' exonuclease activities with a strong preference for 5'-ends. Acts as a sliding exonuclease that loads at ssDNA ends and then slides along the ssDNA prior to cutting; however the sliding and the 3'-5' exonuclease activities are abolished upon binding to the replication protein A (RPA) complex that enforces 5'-directionality activity.
