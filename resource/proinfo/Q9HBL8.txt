UniprotID	Q9HBL8
Accession	Q9HBL8
EntryName	NMRL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	NmrA-like family domain-containing protein 1
GeneName	NMRAL1 HSCARG
Length	299
Function	Redox sensor protein. Undergoes restructuring and subcellular redistribution in response to changes in intracellular NADPH/NADP(+) levels. At low NADPH concentrations the protein is found mainly as a monomer, and binds argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1), the enzyme involved in nitric oxide synthesis. Association with ASS1 impairs its activity and reduces the production of nitric oxide, which subsecuently prevents apoptosis. Under normal NADPH concentrations, the protein is found as a dimer and hides the binding site for ASS1. The homodimer binds one molecule of NADPH. Has higher affinity for NADPH than for NADP(+). Binding to NADPH is necessary to form a stable dimer.
