ProteinName	Checkpoint protein HUS1 (hHUS1)
GeneName	HUS1
Length	280
Function	Component of the 9-1-1 cell-cycle checkpoint response complex that plays a major role in DNA repair (PubMed:21659603). The 9-1-1 complex is recruited to DNA lesion upon damage by the RAD17-replication factor C (RFC) clamp loader complex (PubMed:21659603). Acts then as a sliding clamp platform on DNA for several proteins involved in long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER) (PubMed:21659603). The 9-1-1 complex stimulates DNA polymerase beta (POLB) activity by increasing its affinity for the 3'-OH end of the primer-template and stabilizes POLB to those sites where LP-BER proceeds; endonuclease FEN1 cleavage activity on substrates with double, nick, or gap flaps of distinct sequences and lengths; and DNA ligase I (LIG1) on long-patch base excision repair substrates (PubMed:21659603). The 9-1-1 complex is necessary for the recruitment of RHNO1 to sites of double-stranded breaks (DSB) occurring during the S phase (PubMed:21659603).
