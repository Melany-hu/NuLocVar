UniprotID	Q9NY64
Accession	Q9NY64;Q8WUZ9;Q9NSC4
EntryName	SL2A8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 8 (Glucose transporter type 8) (GLUT-8) (Glucose transporter type X1)
GeneName	SLC2A8 GLUT8 GLUTX1
Length	477
Function	Insulin-regulated facilitative hexose transporter that mediates the transport of glucose and fructose (By similarity). Facilitates hepatic influx of dietary trehalose, which in turn inhibits glucose and fructose influx triggering a starvation signal and hepatic autophagy through activation of AMPK and ULK1 (PubMed:27922102). Also able to mediate the transport of dehydroascorbate.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane
