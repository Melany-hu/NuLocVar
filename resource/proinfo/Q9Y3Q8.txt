UniprotID	Q9Y3Q8
Accession	Q9Y3Q8;A4D2C3;A8MWR6;D6W5V9
EntryName	T22D4_HUMAN
ProteinName	TSC22 domain family protein 4 (TSC22-related-inducible leucine zipper protein 2)
GeneName	TSC22D4 THG1 THG1-PIT
Length	395
Function	Binds DNA and acts as a transcriptional repressor (PubMed:10488076). Involved in the regulation of systematic glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity, via transcriptional repression of downstream insulin signaling targets such as OBP2A/LCN13 (By similarity). Acts as a negative regulator of lipogenic gene expression in hepatocytes and thereby mediates the control of very low-density lipoprotein release (PubMed:23307490). May play a role in neurite elongation and survival (By similarity).
