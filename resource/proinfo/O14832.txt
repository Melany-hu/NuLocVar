UniprotID	O14832
Accession	O14832;A8MTS8;B1ALH5
EntryName	PAHX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase, peroxisomal (EC 1.14.11.18) (Phytanic acid oxidase) (Phytanoyl-CoA alpha-hydroxylase) (PhyH)
GeneName	PHYH PAHX
Length	338
Function	Catalyzes the 2-hydroxylation of not only racemic phytanoyl-CoA and the isomers of 3-methylhexadecanoyl-CoA, but also a variety of other mono-branched 3-methylacyl-CoA esters (with a chain length of at least seven carbon atoms) and straight-chain acyl-CoA esters (with a chain length longer than four carbon atoms) (PubMed:10744784, PubMed:12031666, PubMed:12923223, PubMed:9326939). Does not hydroxylate long and very long straight chain acyl-CoAs or 2-methyl- and 4-methyl-branched acyl-CoAs (PubMed:10744784, PubMed:12923223).
