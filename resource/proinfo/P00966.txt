UniprotID	P00966
Accession	P00966;Q6LDL2;Q86UZ0;Q96GT4
EntryName	ASSY_HUMAN
ProteinName	Argininosuccinate synthase (EC 6.3.4.5) (Citrulline--aspartate ligase)
GeneName	ASS1 ASS
Length	412
Function	One of the enzymes of the urea cycle, the metabolic pathway transforming neurotoxic amonia produced by protein catabolism into inocuous urea in the liver of ureotelic animals. Catalyzes the formation of arginosuccinate from aspartate, citrulline and ATP and together with ASL it is responsible for the biosynthesis of arginine in most body tissues.
