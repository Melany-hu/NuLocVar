UniprotID	Q8N693
Accession	Q8N693;B0QYU3;Q7Z6K7
EntryName	ESX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein ESX1 (Extraembryonic, spermatogenesis, homeobox 1) [Cleaved into: Homeobox protein ESX1-N; Homeobox protein ESX1-C]
GeneName	ESX1 ESX1L ESX1R
Length	406
Function	May coordinately regulate cell cycle progression and transcription during spermatogenesis. Inhibits degradation of polyubiquitinated cyclin A and cyclin B1 and thereby arrests the cell cycle at early M phase. ESXR1-N acts as a transcriptional repressor. Binds to the sequence 5'-TAATGTTATTA-3' which is present within the first intron of the KRAS gene and inhibits its expression. ESXR1-C has the ability to inhibit cyclin turnover.
