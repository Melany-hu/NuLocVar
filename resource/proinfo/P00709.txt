UniprotID	P00709
Accession	P00709;Q6FGX0;Q9UDK4
EntryName	LALBA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-lactalbumin (Lactose synthase B protein) (Lysozyme-like protein 7)
GeneName	LALBA LYZL7
Length	142
Function	Regulatory subunit of lactose synthase, changes the substrate specificity of galactosyltransferase in the mammary gland making glucose a good acceptor substrate for this enzyme. This enables LS to synthesize lactose, the major carbohydrate component of milk. In other tissues, galactosyltransferase transfers galactose onto the N-acetylglucosamine of the oligosaccharide chains in glycoproteins.
