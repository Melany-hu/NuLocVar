UniprotID	P48739
Accession	P48739;B3KYB8;B7Z7Q0;Q8N5W1
EntryName	PIPNB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein beta isoform (PI-TP-beta) (PtdIns transfer protein beta) (PtdInsTP beta)
GeneName	PITPNB
Length	271
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine between membranes (PubMed:10531358, PubMed:18636990, PubMed:20332109). Also catalyzes the transfer of sphingomyelin (By similarity). Required for COPI-mediated retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum; phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine transfer activity is essential for this function (PubMed:20332109).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
