UniprotID	P60604
Accession	P60604;A6NMQ7;A8K3L4;D3DSL7;P56554
EntryName	UB2G2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 G2 (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme G2) (Ubiquitin carrier protein G2) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase G2)
GeneName	UBE2G2 UBC7
Length	165
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins (PubMed:20061386). In vitro catalyzes 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:20061386). Involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) (PubMed:22607976). Required for sterol-induced ubiquitination of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and its subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:23223569).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum; Lipid droplet
