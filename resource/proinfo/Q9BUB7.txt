UniprotID	Q9BUB7
Accession	Q9BUB7;E9PDY9;Q9NWY5
EntryName	TMM70_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 70, mitochondrial
GeneName	TMEM70
Length	260
Function	Scaffold protein that participates in the c-ring assembly of mitochondrial ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or complex V) by facilitating the membrane insertion and oligomer formation of the subunit c/ATP5MC1 through its interaction (PubMed:31652072, PubMed:32275929, PubMed:33359711, PubMed:33753518). Therefore, participates in the early stage of mitochondrial ATP synthase biogenesis and also protects subunit c/ATP5MC1 against intramitochondrial proteolysis (PubMed:18953340, PubMed:20937241, PubMed:31652072, PubMed:33359711). In addition, binds the mitochondrial proton-transporting ATP synthase complexes I and may play a role in the stability of its membrane-bound subassemblies (PubMed:32275929).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
