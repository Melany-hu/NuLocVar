UniprotID	P50591
Accession	P50591;A1Y9B3
EntryName	TNF10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 10 (Apo-2 ligand) (Apo-2L) (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) (Protein TRAIL) (CD antigen CD253)
GeneName	TNFSF10 APO2L TRAIL
Length	281
Function	Cytokine that binds to TNFRSF10A/TRAILR1, TNFRSF10B/TRAILR2, TNFRSF10C/TRAILR3, TNFRSF10D/TRAILR4 and possibly also to TNFRSF11B/OPG (PubMed:10549288, PubMed:26457518). Induces apoptosis. Its activity may be modulated by binding to the decoy receptors TNFRSF10C/TRAILR3, TNFRSF10D/TRAILR4 and TNFRSF11B/OPG that cannot induce apoptosis.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted
