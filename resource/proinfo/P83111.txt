UniprotID	P83111
Accession	P83111;P83096
EntryName	LACTB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine beta-lactamase-like protein LACTB, mitochondrial (EC 3.4.-.-)
GeneName	LACTB MRPL56 UNQ843/PRO1781
Length	547
Function	Mitochondrial serine protease that acts as a regulator of mitochondrial lipid metabolism (PubMed:28329758). Acts by decreasing protein levels of PISD, a mitochondrial enzyme that converts phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) to phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), thereby affecting mitochondrial lipid metabolism (PubMed:28329758). It is unclear whether it acts directly by mediating proteolysis of PISD or by mediating proteolysis of another lipid metabolism protein (PubMed:28329758). Acts as a tumor suppressor that has the ability to inhibit proliferation of multiple types of breast cancer cells: probably by promoting decreased levels of PISD, thereby affecting mitochondrial lipid metabolism (PubMed:28329758).
