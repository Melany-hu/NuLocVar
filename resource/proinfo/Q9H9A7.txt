UniprotID	Q9H9A7
Accession	Q9H9A7;Q05BX1;Q05CW3;Q5SQG8;Q5SQG9;Q6P1Q4;Q6PI89;Q7Z6L6
EntryName	RMI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RecQ-mediated genome instability protein 1 (BLM-associated protein of 75 kDa) (BLAP75) (FAAP75)
GeneName	RMI1 C9orf76
Length	625
Function	Essential component of the RMI complex, a complex that plays an important role in the processing of homologous recombination intermediates to limit DNA crossover formation in cells. Promotes TOP3A binding to double Holliday junctions (DHJ) and hence stimulates TOP3A-mediated dissolution. Required for BLM phosphorylation during mitosis. Within the BLM complex, required for BLM and TOP3A stability.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
