UniprotID	Q71UI9-3
Accession	Q71UI9;A6NFA8;A6NKY0;A6NN01;A8MQC5;Q59GV8;Q6PK98
EntryName	H2AV_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A.V (H2A.F/Z) (H2A.Z variant histone 2)
GeneName	H2AZ2 H2AFV H2AV
Length	90
Function	Variant histone H2A which replaces conventional H2A in a subset of nucleosomes. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling. May be involved in the formation of constitutive heterochromatin. May be required for chromosome segregation during cell division (By similarity).
