UniprotID	Q8IVV7
Accession	Q8IVV7;Q8TEB5;Q9BW50
EntryName	GID4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucose-induced degradation protein 4 homolog (Vacuolar import and degradation protein 24 homolog)
GeneName	GID4 C17orf39 VID24
Length	300
Function	Substrate-recognition subunit of the CTLH E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex that selectively accepts ubiquitin from UBE2H and mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the transcription factor HBP1 (Probable) (PubMed:29911972). Binds proteins and peptides with a Pro/N-degron consisting of an unmodified N-terminal Pro followed by a small residue, and has the highest affinity for the peptide Pro-Gly-Leu-Trp (PubMed:29632410). Binds peptides with an N-terminal sequence of the type Pro---. Does not bind peptides with an acetylated N-terminal Pro residue (PubMed:29632410).
