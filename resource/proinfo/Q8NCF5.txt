UniprotID	Q8NCF5
Accession	Q8NCF5;B7Z4G5;Q66K34;Q6NVK1;Q8NFR2;Q96ST9
EntryName	NF2IP_HUMAN
ProteinName	NFATC2-interacting protein (45 kDa NF-AT-interacting protein) (45 kDa NFAT-interacting protein) (Nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 2-interacting protein)
GeneName	NFATC2IP NIP45
Length	419
Function	In T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, regulates the magnitude of NFAT-driven transcription of a specific subset of cytokine genes, including IL3, IL4, IL5 and IL13, but not IL2. Recruits PRMT1 to the IL4 promoter; this leads to enhancement of histone H4 'Arg-3'-methylation and facilitates subsequent histone acetylation at the IL4 locus, thus promotes robust cytokine expression (By similarity). Down-regulates formation of poly-SUMO chains by UBE2I/UBC9 (By similarity).
