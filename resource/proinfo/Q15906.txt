UniprotID	Q15906
Accession	Q15906;A6NLK9;A6PW55;Q53GJ2;Q5U0R4
EntryName	VPS72_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 72 homolog (Protein YL-1) (Transcription factor-like 1)
GeneName	VPS72 TCFL1 YL1
Length	364
Function	Deposition-and-exchange histone chaperone specific for H2AZ1, specifically chaperones H2AZ1 and deposits it into nucleosomes. As component of the SRCAP complex, mediates the ATP-dependent exchange of histone H2AZ1/H2B dimers for nucleosomal H2A/H2B, leading to transcriptional regulation of selected genes by chromatin remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
