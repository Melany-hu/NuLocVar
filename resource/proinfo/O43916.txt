EntryName	CHST1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 1 (Galactose/N-acetylglucosamine/N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase 1) (GST-1) (Keratan sulfate Gal-6 sulfotransferase) (KS6ST) (KSGal6ST) (KSST) (EC 2.8.2.21)
GeneName	CHST1
Length	411
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) as sulfonate donor to catalyze the transfer of sulfate to position 6 of internal galactose (Gal) residues of keratan. Cooperates with B4GALT4 and B3GNT7 glycosyltransferases and CHST6 sulfotransferase to construct and elongate disulfated disaccharide unit  within keratan sulfate polymer (PubMed:10642612, PubMed:17690104, PubMed:9405439). Has a preference for sulfating keratan sulfate, but it also transfers sulfate to the unsulfated polymer (PubMed:9405439). Involved in biosynthesis of phosphacan, a major keratan sulfate proteoglycan in the developing brain (By similarity). Involved in biosynthesis of 6-sulfoGalbeta-containing O-linked glycans in high endothelial venules of lymph nodes. May act in a synergistic manner with CHST4 to generate sialyl 6',6-disulfo Lewis X motif, a recognition determinant for immune cell receptors implicated in leukocyte trafficking (PubMed:10330415). Catalyzes sulfation of N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) oligosaccharides with highest efficiency for sialylated LacNAc structures (PubMed:10642612).
