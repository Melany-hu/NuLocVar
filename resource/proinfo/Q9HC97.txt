EntryName	GPR35_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 35 (Kynurenic acid receptor) (KYNA receptor)
GeneName	GPR35
Length	309
Function	G-protein coupled receptor that binds to several ligands including the tryptophan metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) with high affinity, leading to rapid and transient activation of numerous intracellular signaling pathways (PubMed:16754668, PubMed:20361937, PubMed:35148838). Plays a role in neutrophil recruitment to sites of inflammation and bacterial clearance through the major serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA that acts as a physiological ligand (PubMed:35148838). Stimulates lipid metabolism, thermogenic, and anti-inflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue once activated by kynurenic acid (By similarity). In macrophages, activation by lysophosphatidic acid promotes GPR35-induced signaling with a distinct transcriptional profile characterized by TNF production associated with ERK and NF-kappa-B activation. In turn, induces chemotaxis of macrophages (By similarity).
