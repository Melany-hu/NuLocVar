EntryName	KAD4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenylate kinase 4, mitochondrial (EC 2.7.4.4) (EC 2.7.4.6) (Adenylate kinase 3-like) (GTP:AMP phosphotransferase AK4)
GeneName	AK4 AK3 AK3L1
Length	223
Function	Broad-specificity mitochondrial nucleoside phosphate kinase involved in cellular nucleotide homeostasis by catalyzing nucleoside-phosphate interconversions (PubMed:19073142, PubMed:19766732, PubMed:23416111, PubMed:24767988). Similar to other adenylate kinases, preferentially catalyzes the phosphorylation of the nucleoside monophosphate AMP with ATP as phosphate donor to produce ADP (PubMed:19766732). Phosphorylates only AMP when using GTP as phosphate donor (PubMed:19766732). In vitro, can also catalyze the phosphorylation of CMP, dAMP and dCMP and use GTP as an alternate phosphate donor (PubMed:19766732, PubMed:23416111). Moreover, exhibits a diphosphate kinase activity, producing ATP, CTP, GTP, UTP, TTP, dATP, dCTP and dGTP from the corresponding diphosphate substrates with either ATP or GTP as phosphate donors (PubMed:23416111). Plays a role in controlling cellular ATP levels by regulating phosphorylation and activation of the energy sensor protein kinase AMPK (PubMed:24767988, PubMed:26980435). Plays a protective role in the cellular response to oxidative stress (PubMed:19130895, PubMed:23474458, PubMed:26980435).
