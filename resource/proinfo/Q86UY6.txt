EntryName	NAA40_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-alpha-acetyltransferase 40 (EC 2.3.1.257) (N-acetyltransferase 11) (N-alpha-acetyltransferase D) (NatD) (hNatD) (Protein acetyltransferase 1)
GeneName	NAA40 NAT11 PATT1
Length	237
Function	N-alpha-acetyltransferase that specifically mediates the acetylation of the N-terminal residues of histones H4 and H2A (PubMed:21935442, PubMed:25619998). In contrast to other N-alpha-acetyltransferase, has a very specific selectivity for histones H4 and H2A N-terminus and specifically recognizes the 'Ser-Gly-Arg-Gly sequence' (PubMed:21935442, PubMed:25619998). Acts as a negative regulator of apoptosis (PubMed:26666750). May play a role in hepatic lipid metabolism (By similarity).
