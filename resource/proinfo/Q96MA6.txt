UniprotID	Q96MA6
Accession	Q96MA6;A8K821;Q8N9W9
EntryName	KAD8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenylate kinase 8 (AK 8) (EC 2.7.4.3) (EC 2.7.4.6) (ATP-AMP transphosphorylase 8)
GeneName	AK8 C9orf98
Length	479
Function	Nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinase that catalyzes the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphate group between nucleoside triphosphates and monophosphates. Has highest activity toward AMP, and weaker activity toward dAMP, CMP and dCMP. Also displays broad nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity.
