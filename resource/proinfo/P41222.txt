UniprotID	P41222
Accession	P41222;B2R727;Q5SQ10;Q7M4P3;Q9UC22;Q9UCC9;Q9UCD9
EntryName	PTGDS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase (EC 5.3.99.2) (Beta-trace protein) (Cerebrin-28) (Glutathione-independent PGD synthase) (Lipocalin-type prostaglandin-D synthase) (L-PGDS) (Prostaglandin-D2 synthase) (PGD2 synthase) (PGDS) (PGDS2)
GeneName	PTGDS PDS
Length	190
Function	Catalyzes the conversion of PGH2 to PGD2, a prostaglandin involved in smooth muscle contraction/relaxation and a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation (PubMed:20667974). Involved in a variety of CNS functions, such as sedation, NREM sleep and PGE2-induced allodynia, and may have an anti-apoptotic role in oligodendrocytes. Binds small non-substrate lipophilic molecules, including biliverdin, bilirubin, retinal, retinoic acid and thyroid hormone, and may act as a scavenger for harmful hydrophobic molecules and as a secretory retinoid and thyroid hormone transporter. Possibly involved in development and maintenance of the blood-brain, blood-retina, blood-aqueous humor and blood-testis barrier. It is likely to play important roles in both maturation and maintenance of the central nervous system and male reproductive system (PubMed:20667974, PubMed:9475419). Involved in PLA2G3-dependent maturation of mast cells. PLA2G3 is secreted by immature mast cells and acts on nearby fibroblasts upstream to PTDGS to synthesize PGD2, which in turn promotes mast cell maturation and degranulation via PTGDR (By similarity).
