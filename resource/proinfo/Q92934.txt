UniprotID	Q92934
Accession	Q92934;O14803;Q6FH21
EntryName	BAD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bcl2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD) (Bcl-2-binding component 6) (Bcl-2-like protein 8) (Bcl2-L-8) (Bcl-xL/Bcl-2-associated death promoter) (Bcl2 antagonist of cell death)
GeneName	BAD BBC6 BCL2L8
Length	168
Function	Promotes cell death. Successfully competes for the binding to Bcl-X(L), Bcl-2 and Bcl-W, thereby affecting the level of heterodimerization of these proteins with BAX. Can reverse the death repressor activity of Bcl-X(L), but not that of Bcl-2 (By similarity). Appears to act as a link between growth factor receptor signaling and the apoptotic pathways.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane; Cytoplasm
