UniprotID	P09488
Accession	P09488;Q5GHG0;Q6FH88;Q8TC98;Q9UC96
EntryName	GSTM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutathione S-transferase Mu 1 (EC 2.5.1.18) (GST HB subunit 4) (GST class-mu 1) (GSTM1-1) (GSTM1a-1a) (GSTM1b-1b) (GTH4)
GeneName	GSTM1 GST1
Length	218
Function	Conjugation of reduced glutathione to a wide number of exogenous and endogenous hydrophobic electrophiles. Involved in the formation of glutathione conjugates of both prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) and prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) (PubMed:9084911). Participates in the formation of novel hepoxilin regioisomers (PubMed:21046276).
