UniprotID	Q5T2R2
Accession	Q5T2R2;Q53F75;Q6P473;Q86WQ8;Q9Y2W5
EntryName	DPS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	All trans-polyprenyl-diphosphate synthase PDSS1 (All-trans-decaprenyl-diphosphate synthase subunit 1) (EC 2.5.1.91) (Decaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase subunit 1) (Decaprenyl-diphosphate synthase subunit 1) (Solanesyl-diphosphate synthase subunit 1) (Trans-prenyltransferase 1) (TPT 1)
GeneName	PDSS1 DPS1 TPRT
Length	415
Function	Heterotetrameric enzyme that catalyzes the condensation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), which acts as a primer, and isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) to produce prenyl diphosphates of varying chain lengths and participates in the determination of the side chain of ubiquinone (PubMed:16262699). Supplies nona and decaprenyl diphosphate, the precursors for the side chain of the isoprenoid quinones ubiquinone-9 (Q9)and ubiquinone-10 (Q10) respectively (PubMed:16262699). The enzyme adds isopentenyl diphosphate molecules sequentially to farnesyl diphosphate with trans stereochemistry (PubMed:16262699).
