UniprotID	Q8N386
Accession	Q8N386;Q6IQ00;Q8N9A5
EntryName	LRC25_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 25 (Monocyte and plasmacytoid-activated protein)
GeneName	LRRC25 MAPA UNQ6169/PRO20174
Length	305
Function	Plays a role in the inhibition of RLR-mediated type I interferon signaling pathway by targeting RIGI for autophagic degradation. Interacts specifically with ISG15-associated RIGI to promote interaction between RIGI and the autophagic cargo receptor p62/SQSTM1 to mediate RIGI degradation via selective autophagy (PubMed:29288164). Also plays a role in the inhibition of NF-kappa-B signaling pathway and inflammatory response by promoting the degradation of p65/RELA.
