UniprotID	O14735
Accession	O14735;B4DUV0;H3BTV1;Q6FGU1;Q6ZN70
EntryName	CDIPT_HUMAN
ProteinName	CDP-diacylglycerol--inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase (EC 2.7.8.11) (Phosphatidylinositol synthase) (PI synthase) (PtdIns synthase)
GeneName	CDIPT PIS PIS1
Length	213
Function	Catalyzes the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) as well as PtdIns:inositol exchange reaction. May thus act to reduce an excessive cellular PtdIns content. The exchange activity is due to the reverse reaction of PtdIns synthase and is dependent on CMP, which is tightly bound to the enzyme.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Cell membrane
