UniprotID	Q9NZD2
Accession	Q9NZD2;Q53Z13;Q96J68
EntryName	GLTP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP)
GeneName	GLTP
Length	209
Function	Accelerates the intermembrane transfer of various glycolipids. Catalyzes the transfer of various glycosphingolipids between membranes but does not catalyze the transfer of phospholipids. May be involved in the intracellular translocation of glucosylceramides.
