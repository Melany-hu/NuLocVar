UniprotID	Q8TAT2
Accession	Q8TAT2;B2RD68;Q8NBN0
EntryName	FGFP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor-binding protein 3 (FGF-BP3) (FGF-binding protein 3) (FGFBP-3)
GeneName	FGFBP3 C10orf13 PSEC0101
Length	258
Function	Heparin-binding protein which binds to FGF2, prevents binding of FGF2 to heparin and probably inhibits immobilization of FGF2 on extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycans, allowing its release and subsequent activation of FGFR signaling which leads to increased vascular permeability.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
