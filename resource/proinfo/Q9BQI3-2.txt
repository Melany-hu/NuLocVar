EntryName	E2AK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 1 (EC 2.7.11.1) (Heme-controlled repressor) (HCR) (Heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2-alpha kinase) (Heme-regulated inhibitor) (hHRI) (Hemin-sensitive initiation factor 2-alpha kinase)
GeneName	EIF2AK1 HRI KIAA1369 PRO1362
Length	629
Function	Metabolic-stress sensing protein kinase that phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha) in response to various stress conditions (PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707, PubMed:37327776, PubMed:37550454, PubMed:38340717). Key activator of the integrated stress response (ISR) required for adaptation to various stress, such as heme deficiency, oxidative stress, osmotic shock, mitochondrial dysfunction and heat shock (PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707, PubMed:37327776, PubMed:37550454, PubMed:38340717). EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation in response to stress converts EIF2S1/eIF-2-alpha in a global protein synthesis inhibitor, leading to a global attenuation of cap-dependent translation, while concomitantly initiating the preferential translation of ISR-specific mRNAs, such as the transcriptional activator ATF4, and hence allowing ATF4-mediated reprogramming (PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707, PubMed:37327776). Acts as a key sensor of heme-deficiency: in normal conditions, binds hemin via a cysteine thiolate and histidine nitrogenous coordination, leading to inhibit the protein kinase activity (By similarity). This binding occurs with moderate affinity, allowing it to sense the heme concentration within the cell: heme depletion relieves inhibition and stimulates kinase activity, activating the ISR (By similarity). Thanks to this unique heme-sensing capacity, plays a crucial role to shut off protein synthesis during acute heme-deficient conditions (By similarity). In red blood cells (RBCs), controls hemoglobin synthesis ensuring a coordinated regulation of the synthesis of its heme and globin moieties (By similarity). It thereby plays an essential protective role for RBC survival in anemias of iron deficiency (By similarity). Iron deficiency also triggers activation by full-length DELE1 (PubMed:37327776). Also activates the ISR in response to mitochondrial dysfunction: HRI/EIF2AK1 protein kinase activity is activated upon binding to the processed form of DELE1 (S-DELE1), thereby promoting the ATF4-mediated reprogramming (PubMed:32132706, PubMed:32132707). Also acts as an activator of mitophagy in response to mitochondrial damage: catalyzes phosphorylation of eIF-2-alpha (EIF2S1) following activation by S-DELE1, thereby promoting mitochondrial localization of EIF2S1, triggering PRKN-independent mitophagy (PubMed:38340717).
