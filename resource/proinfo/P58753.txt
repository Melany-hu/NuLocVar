UniprotID	P58753
Accession	P58753;B3KW65;Q56UH9;Q56UI0;Q8N5E5
EntryName	TIRAP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter protein (TIR domain-containing adapter protein) (Adaptor protein Wyatt) (MyD88 adapter-like protein) (MyD88-2)
GeneName	TIRAP MAL
Length	221
Function	Adapter involved in TLR2, TLR4 and RAGE signaling pathways in the innate immune response. Acts via IRAK2 and TRAF-6, leading to the activation of NF-kappa-B, MAPK1, MAPK3 and JNK, and resulting in cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response. Positively regulates the production of TNF-alpha (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL6).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cell membrane; Membrane
