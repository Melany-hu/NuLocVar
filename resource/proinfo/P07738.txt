UniprotID	P07738
Accession	P07738;A4D1N9
EntryName	PMGE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) (EC 5.4.2.4) (2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase, erythrocyte) (2,3-bisphosphoglycerate synthase) (EC 5.4.2.11) (2,3-diphosphoglycerate mutase) (DPGM) (BPG-dependent PGAM)
GeneName	BPGM
Length	259
Function	Plays a major role in regulating hemoglobin oxygen affinity by controlling the levels of its allosteric effector 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). Also exhibits mutase (EC 5.4.2.11) activity.
