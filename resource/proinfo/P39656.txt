EntryName	OST48_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase 48 kDa subunit (DDOST 48 kDa subunit) (Oligosaccharyl transferase 48 kDa subunit)
GeneName	DDOST KIAA0115 OST48 OK/SW-cl.45
Length	456
Function	Subunit of the oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) complex that catalyzes the initial transfer of a defined glycan (Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) in eukaryotes) from the lipid carrier dolichol-pyrophosphate to an asparagine residue within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif in nascent polypeptide chains, the first step in protein N-glycosylation (PubMed:31831667). N-glycosylation occurs cotranslationally and the complex associates with the Sec61 complex at the channel-forming translocon complex that mediates protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). All subunits are required for a maximal enzyme activity (By similarity). Required for the assembly of both SST3A- and SS3B-containing OST complexes (PubMed:22467853).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
