UniprotID	Q9H0F7
Accession	Q9H0F7;A8KA93;D3DN31
EntryName	ARL6_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 6 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 3 protein)
GeneName	ARL6 BBS3
Length	186
Function	Involved in membrane protein trafficking at the base of the ciliary organelle. Mediates recruitment onto plasma membrane of the BBSome complex which would constitute a coat complex required for sorting of specific membrane proteins to the primary cilia (PubMed:20603001). Together with BBS1, is necessary for correct trafficking of PKD1 to primary cilia (By similarity). Together with the BBSome complex and LTZL1, controls SMO ciliary trafficking and contributes to the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway regulation (PubMed:22072986). May regulate cilia assembly and disassembly and subsequent ciliary signaling events such as the Wnt signaling cascade (PubMed:20207729). Isoform 2 may be required for proper retinal function and organization (By similarity).
