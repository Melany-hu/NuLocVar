UniprotID	P05408-2
Accession	P05408;P01164;Q6FHD0;Q9BS38
EntryName	7B2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuroendocrine protein 7B2 (Pituitary polypeptide) (Secretogranin V) (Secretogranin-5) (Secretory granule endocrine protein I) [Cleaved into: N-terminal peptide; C-terminal peptide]
GeneName	SCG5 SGNE1
Length	211
Function	Acts as a molecular chaperone for PCSK2/PC2, preventing its premature activation in the regulated secretory pathway. Binds to inactive PCSK2 in the endoplasmic reticulum and facilitates its transport from there to later compartments of the secretory pathway where it is proteolytically matured and activated. Also required for cleavage of PCSK2 but does not appear to be involved in its folding. Plays a role in regulating pituitary hormone secretion. The C-terminal peptide inhibits PCSK2 in vitro.
