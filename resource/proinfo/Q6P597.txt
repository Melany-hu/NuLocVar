ProteinName	Kinesin light chain 3 (KLC2-like) (kinesin light chain 2)
GeneName	KLC3 KLC2 KLC2L
Length	504
Function	Kinesin is a microtubule-associated force-producing protein that may play a role in organelle transport. Plays a role during spermiogenesis in the development of the sperm tail midpiece and in the normal function of spermatozoa (By similarity). May play a role in the formation of the mitochondrial sheath formation in the developing spermatid midpiece (By similarity).
