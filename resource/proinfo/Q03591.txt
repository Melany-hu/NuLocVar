UniprotID	Q03591
Accession	Q03591;A8K465;Q3B774;Q9UJ17
EntryName	FHR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complement factor H-related protein 1 (FHR-1) (H factor-like protein 1) (FHL-1) (H-factor-like 1) (H36)
GeneName	CFHR1 CFHL CFHL1 CFHL1P CFHR1P FHR1 HFL1 HFL2
Length	330
Function	Involved in complement regulation. The dimerized forms have avidity for tissue-bound complement fragments and efficiently compete with the physiological complement inhibitor CFH. Can associate with lipoproteins and may play a role in lipid metabolism.
