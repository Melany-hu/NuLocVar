UniprotID	Q9Y3M2
Accession	Q9Y3M2;B2R4S2;Q66GT6;Q9UIK9
EntryName	CBY1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein chibby homolog 1 (ARPP-binding protein) (Cytosolic leucine-rich protein) (PIGEA-14) (PKD2 interactor, Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum-associated 1)
GeneName	CBY1 ARB1 C22orf2 CBY PGEA1 HRIHFB2025
Length	126
Function	Inhibits the Wnt/Wingless pathway by binding to CTNNB1/beta-catenin and inhibiting beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation through competition with TCF/LEF transcription factors. Has also been shown to play a role in regulating the intracellular trafficking of polycystin-2/PKD2 and possibly of other intracellular proteins. Promotes adipocyte and cardiomyocyte differentiation.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus speckle; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium basal body; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome; Centriole; Golgi apparatus; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network
