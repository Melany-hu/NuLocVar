UniprotID	Q86Y39
Accession	Q86Y39;C9JT23;Q6ZS66
EntryName	NDUAB_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 11 (Complex I-B14.7) (CI-B14.7) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B14.7)
GeneName	NDUFA11
Length	141
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
