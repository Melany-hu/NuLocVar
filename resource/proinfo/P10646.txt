UniprotID	P10646
Accession	P10646;O95103;Q53TS4
EntryName	TFPI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) (Extrinsic pathway inhibitor) (EPI) (Lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor) (LACI)
GeneName	TFPI LACI TFPI1
Length	304
Function	Inhibits factor X (X(a)) directly and, in a Xa-dependent way, inhibits VIIa/tissue factor activity, presumably by forming a quaternary Xa/LACI/VIIa/TF complex. It possesses an antithrombotic action and also the ability to associate with lipoproteins in plasma.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Microsome membrane
