UniprotID	Q9H9S3
Accession	Q9H9S3;A8K8D0;B4DX72;F8W773
EntryName	S61A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein transport protein Sec61 subunit alpha isoform 2 (Sec61 alpha-2)
GeneName	SEC61A2
Length	476
Function	Component of SEC61 channel-forming translocon complex that mediates transport of signal peptide-containing precursor polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Forms a ribosome receptor and a gated pore in the ER membrane, both functions required for cotranslational translocation of nascent polypeptides.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
