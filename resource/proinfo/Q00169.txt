UniprotID	Q00169
Accession	Q00169
EntryName	PIPNA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein alpha isoform (PI-TP-alpha) (PtdIns transfer protein alpha) (PtdInsTP alpha)
GeneName	PITPNA PITPN
Length	270
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) between membranes (PubMed:10531358, PubMed:14962392, PubMed:15522822, PubMed:18636990, PubMed:22822086). Shows a preference for PI and PC containing shorter saturated or monosaturated acyl chains at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions (PubMed:15522822, PubMed:22822086). Preference order for PC is C16:1 > C16:0 > C18:1 > C18:0 > C20:4 and for PI is C16:1 > C16:0 > C18:1 > C18:0 > C20:4 > C20:3 (PubMed:22822086).
