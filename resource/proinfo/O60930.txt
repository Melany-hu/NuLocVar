UniprotID	O60930
Accession	O60930;B3KQU4;O60523;O60857;Q57Z93;Q5U0C1;Q6FHD4
EntryName	RNH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1) (EC 3.1.26.4) (Ribonuclease H type II)
GeneName	RNASEH1 RNH1
Length	286
Function	Endonuclease that specifically degrades the RNA of RNA-DNA hybrids (PubMed:10497183). Plays a role in RNA polymerase II (RNAp II) transcription termination by degrading R-loop RNA-DNA hybrid formation at G-rich pause sites located downstream of the poly(A) site and behind the elongating RNAp II (PubMed:21700224).
