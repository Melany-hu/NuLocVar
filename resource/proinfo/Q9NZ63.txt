UniprotID	Q9NZ63
Accession	Q9NZ63;B3KPX8;Q8WVU6;Q9NT39
EntryName	TLS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Splicing factor C9orf78 (Hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 59)
GeneName	C9orf78 HCA59
Length	289
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing by promoting usage of the upstream 3'-splice site at alternative NAGNAG splice sites; these are sites featuring alternative acceptor motifs separated by only a few nucleotides (PubMed:35241646). May also modulate exon inclusion events (PubMed:35241646). Plays a role in spliceosomal remodeling by displacing WBP4 from SNRNP200 and may act to inhibit SNRNP200 helicase activity (PubMed:35241646). Binds U5 snRNA (PubMed:35241646). Required for proper chromosome segregation (PubMed:35167828). Not required for splicing of shelterin components (PubMed:35167828).
