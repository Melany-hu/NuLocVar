UniprotID	Q53HC0
Accession	Q53HC0;B3KNQ0;Q9H697
EntryName	CCD92_HUMAN
ProteinName	Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 92 (Limkain beta-2)
GeneName	CCDC92
Length	331
Function	Interferon-stimulated protein that plays a role in innate immunity. Strongly inhibits ebolavirus transcription and replication. Forms a complex with viral RNA-bound nucleocapsid NP and thereby prevents the transport of NP to the cell surface.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome; Centriole; Cytoplasm
