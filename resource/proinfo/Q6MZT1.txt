UniprotID	Q6MZT1
Accession	Q6MZT1;B7Z3X1
EntryName	R7BP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 7-binding protein (R7 family-binding protein)
GeneName	RGS7BP R7BP
Length	257
Function	Regulator of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Regulatory subunit of the R7-Gbeta5 complexes that acts by controlling the subcellular location of the R7-Gbeta5 complexes. When palmitoylated, it targets the R7-Gbeta5 complexes to the plasma membrane, leading to inhibit G protein alpha subunits. When it is unpalmitoylated, the R7-Gbeta5 complexes undergo a nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling. May also act by controlling the proteolytic stability of R7 proteins, probably by protecting them from degradation.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cell membrane
