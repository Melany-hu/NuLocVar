Function	Activator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by acting as a ligand for LGR4-6 receptors, which acts as a key regulator of angiogenesis. Upon binding to LGR4-6 (LGR4, LGR5 or LGR6), LGR4-6 associate with phosphorylated LRP6 and frizzled receptors that are activated by extracellular Wnt receptors, triggering the canonical Wnt signaling pathway to increase expression of target genes. Also regulates the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin-dependent pathway and non-canonical Wnt signaling by acting as an inhibitor of ZNRF3, an important regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. Acts as a ligand for frizzled FZD8 and LRP6. May negatively regulate the TGF-beta pathway (PubMed:21727895, PubMed:21909076, PubMed:22615920). Acts as a key regulator of angiogenesis by controlling vascular stability and pruning: acts by activating the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway in endothelial cells (By similarity) (PubMed:21727895, PubMed:21909076, PubMed:22615920). Can also amplify Wnt signaling pathway independently of LGR4-6 receptors, possibly by acting as a direct antagonistic ligand to RNF43 and ZNRF3 (PubMed:29769720).
