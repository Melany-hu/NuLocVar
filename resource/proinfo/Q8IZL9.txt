UniprotID	Q8IZL9
Accession	Q8IZL9;A2A389;A2A390;B4DQX1;O95137;Q5EDC4;Q5VYW1;Q9BUF4
EntryName	CDK20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-dependent kinase 20 (EC 2.7.11.22) (CDK-activating kinase p42) (CAK-kinase p42) (Cell cycle-related kinase) (Cell division protein kinase 20) (Cyclin-dependent protein kinase H) (Cyclin-kinase-activating kinase p42)
GeneName	CDK20 CCRK CDCH
Length	346
Function	Required for high-level Shh responses in the developing neural tube. Together with TBC1D32, controls the structure of the primary cilium by coordinating assembly of the ciliary membrane and axoneme, allowing GLI2 to be properly activated in response to SHH signaling (By similarity). Involved in cell growth. Activates CDK2, a kinase involved in the control of the cell cycle, by phosphorylating residue 'Thr-160'.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cell projection; Cilium
