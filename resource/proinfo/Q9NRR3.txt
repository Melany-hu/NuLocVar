UniprotID	Q9NRR3
Accession	Q9NRR3;B2R622;Q4KMT9
EntryName	C42S2_HUMAN
ProteinName	CDC42 small effector protein 2 (Small effector of CDC42 protein 2)
GeneName	CDC42SE2 SPEC2
Length	84
Function	Probably involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton by acting downstream of CDC42, inducing actin filament assembly. Alters CDC42-induced cell shape changes. In activated T-cells, may play a role in CDC42-mediated F-actin accumulation at the immunological synapse. May play a role in early contractile events in phagocytosis in macrophages.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cell membrane; Cell projection; Phagocytic cup
