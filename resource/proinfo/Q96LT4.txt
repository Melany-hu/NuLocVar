EntryName	SAMD8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sphingomyelin synthase-related protein 1 (SMSr) (EC 2.7.8.-) (Ceramide phosphoethanolamine synthase) (CPE synthase) (Sterile alpha motif domain-containing protein 8) (SAM domain-containing protein 8)
GeneName	SAMD8
Length	415
Function	Synthesizes sphingolipids through transfer of a phosphatidyl head group from a glycerophospholipid on to the primary hydroxyl of a ceramide in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:19506037, PubMed:38388831). Catalyzes the synthesis of ceramide phosphoethanolamines (CPEs) (such as N-acylsphing-4-enine 1-phosphoethanolamine) by transferring phosphoethanolamine head group, which is smaller and more hydrophilic than the phosphocholine (PC) headgroup transferred in the canonical sphingomyelin synthesis (SMS) reaction by SMS1 or SMS2, from a phosphatidylethanolamine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, PE) to a ceramide (such as N-acylsphing-4-enine) (PubMed:19506037, PubMed:38388831). The larger PC prevents an efficient fit in the enzyme's catalytic pocket, leading to little or no SMS activity (PubMed:19506037, PubMed:38388831). In vitro, in the absence of ceramide, it has PLC activity with preference for phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidic acid, but also hydrolyzes phosphatidylethanolamine (PubMed:33621517, PubMed:38388831).
