EntryName	MBLC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase MBLAC2 (Acyl-CoA thioesterase MBLAC2) (EC 3.1.2.2) (Beta-lactamase MBLAC2) (EC 3.5.2.6) (Metallo-beta-lactamase domain-containing protein 2) (Palmitoyl-coenzyme A thioesterase MBLAC2)
GeneName	MBLAC2
Length	279
Function	Acyl-CoA thioesterases are a group of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs to the free fatty acid and coenzyme A (CoASH), providing the potential to regulate intracellular levels of acyl-CoAs, free fatty acids and CoASH (PubMed:33219126). Has an acyl-CoA thioesterase activity towards the long chain fatty acyl-CoA thioester palmitoyl-CoA (hexadecanoyl-CoA; C16:0-CoA) (PubMed:33219126). Displays a substrate preference for fatty acyl-CoAs with chain-lengths C12-C18 (PubMed:33219126). Possesses beta-lactamase activity, catalyzing the hydrolysis of penicillin G and nitrocefin (PubMed:31434986). Exhibits no activity towards other beta-lactam antibiotic classes including cephalosporins (cefotaxime) and carbapenems (imipenem) (PubMed:31434986).
