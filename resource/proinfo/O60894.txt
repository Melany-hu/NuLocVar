UniprotID	O60894
Accession	O60894;Q6FGS5
EntryName	RAMP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (Calcitonin-receptor-like receptor activity-modifying protein 1) (CRLR activity-modifying protein 1)
GeneName	RAMP1
Length	148
Function	Accessory protein that interacts with and modulates the function of G-protein coupled receptors including calcitonin gene-related peptide type 1 receptor (CALCRL) and calcitonin receptor (CALCR) (PubMed:33602864, PubMed:9620797, PubMed:35324283, PubMed:38603770). Required for the transport of CALCRL to the plasma membrane (PubMed:9620797). Together with CALCRL, form the receptor complex for the calcitonin gene-related peptides CGRP1/CALCA and CGRP2/CALCB (PubMed:33602864, PubMed:9620797). Together with CALCR, form the AMYR1 receptor complex for amylin/IAPP and CGRP1/CALCA (PubMed:35324283, PubMed:38603770).
