EntryName	KCNKA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Potassium channel subfamily K member 10 (Outward rectifying potassium channel protein TREK-2) (TREK-2 K(+) channel subunit)
GeneName	KCNK10 TREK2
Length	538
Function	K(+) channel that conducts voltage-dependent outward rectifying currents upon membrane depolarization. Voltage sensing is coupled to K(+) electrochemical gradient in an 'ion flux gating' mode where outward but not inward ion flow opens the gate. Converts to voltage-independent 'leak' conductance mode upon stimulation by various stimuli including mechanical membrane stretch, acidic pH, heat and lipids (PubMed:10880510, PubMed:25766236, PubMed:26919430, PubMed:38605031). Homo- and heterodimerizes to form functional channels with distinct regulatory and gating properties (PubMed:30573346). In trigeminal ganglia sensory neurons, the heterodimer of KCNK10/TREK-2 and KCNK18/TRESK inhibits neuronal firing and neurogenic inflammation by stabilizing the resting membrane potential at K(+) equilibrium potential as well as by regulating the threshold of action potentials and the spike frequency (By similarity). Permeable to other monovalent ions such as Rb(+) and Cs(+) (PubMed:26919430).
