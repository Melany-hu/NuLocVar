UniprotID	O14558
Accession	O14558;O14551;Q6NVI3;Q96MG9
EntryName	HSPB6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heat shock protein beta-6 (HspB6) (Heat shock 20 kDa-like protein p20) (Heat shock protein family B member 6)
GeneName	HSPB6
Length	160
Function	Small heat shock protein which functions as a molecular chaperone probably maintaining denatured proteins in a folding-competent state. Seems to have versatile functions in various biological processes. Plays a role in regulating muscle function such as smooth muscle vasorelaxation and cardiac myocyte contractility. May regulate myocardial angiogenesis implicating KDR. Overexpression mediates cardioprotection and angiogenesis after induced damage. Stabilizes monomeric YWHAZ thereby supporting YWHAZ chaperone-like activity.
