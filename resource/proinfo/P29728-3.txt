UniprotID	P29728-3
Accession	P29728;A8K9T1;Q6PJ33;Q86XX8
EntryName	OAS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthase 2 ((2-5')oligo(A) synthase 2) (2-5A synthase 2) (EC 2.7.7.84) (p69 OAS / p71 OAS) (p69OAS / p71OAS)
GeneName	OAS2
Length	172
Function	Interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated antiviral enzyme which plays a critical role in cellular innate antiviral response (PubMed:10464285, PubMed:9880569). Activated by detection of double stranded RNA (dsRNA): polymerizes higher oligomers of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP which then bind to the inactive monomeric form of ribonuclease L (RNASEL) leading to its dimerization and subsequent activation (PubMed:10464285, PubMed:11682059, PubMed:9880569). Activation of RNASEL leads to degradation of cellular as well as viral RNA, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis, thus terminating viral replication (PubMed:10464285, PubMed:9880569). Can mediate the antiviral effect via the classical RNASEL-dependent pathway or an alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNASEL (PubMed:21142819). In addition, it may also play a role in other cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell growth, differentiation and gene regulation (PubMed:21142819). May act as a negative regulator of lactation, stopping lactation in virally infected mammary gland lobules, thereby preventing transmission of viruses to neonates (By similarity). Non-infected lobules would not be affected, allowing efficient pup feeding during infection (By similarity).
