UniprotID	Q07687
Accession	Q07687;B4DMK4;B7ZA14
EntryName	DLX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein DLX-2
GeneName	DLX2
Length	328
Function	Acts as a transcriptional activator (By similarity). Activates transcription of CGA/alpha-GSU, via binding to the downstream activin regulatory element (DARE) in the gene promoter (By similarity). Plays a role in terminal differentiation of interneurons, such as amacrine and bipolar cells in the developing retina. Likely to play a regulatory role in the development of the ventral forebrain (By similarity). May play a role in craniofacial patterning and morphogenesis (By similarity).
