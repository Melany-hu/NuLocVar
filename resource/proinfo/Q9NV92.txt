UniprotID	Q9NV92
Accession	Q9NV92;Q7Z2H3;Q7Z428;Q8TAR3;Q9ULQ5
EntryName	NFIP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	NEDD4 family-interacting protein 2 (NEDD4 WW domain-binding protein 5A) (Putative MAPK-activating protein PM04/PM05/PM06/PM07) (Putative NF-kappa-B-activating protein 413)
GeneName	NDFIP2 KIAA1165 N4WBP5A
Length	336
Function	Activates HECT domain-containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases, including ITCH, NEDD4, NEDD4L, SMURF2, WWP1 and WWP2, and consequently modulates the stability of their targets. As a result, may control many cellular processes. Recruits ITCH, NEDD4 and SMURF2 to endosomal membranes. Negatively regulates KCNH2 potassium channel activity by decreasing its cell-surface expression and interfering with channel maturation through recruitment of NEDD4L to the Golgi apparatus and multivesicular body where it mediates KCNH2 degradation (PubMed:26363003). May modulate EGFR signaling. Together with NDFIP1, limits the cytokine signaling and expansion of effector Th2 T-cells by promoting degradation of JAK1, probably by ITCH- and NEDD4L-mediated ubiquitination (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endosome membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Endosome; Multivesicular body membrane
