UniprotID	Q9UNW8
Accession	Q9UNW8;A8K7X7;B4E144;Q9BSU2
EntryName	GP132_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable G-protein coupled receptor 132 (G2 accumulation protein)
GeneName	GPR132 G2A
Length	380
Function	May be a receptor for oxidized free fatty acids derived from linoleic and arachidonic acids such as 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HODE). Activates a G alpha protein, most likely G alpha(q). May be involved in apoptosis. Functions at the G2/M checkpoint to delay mitosis. May function as a sensor that monitors the oxidative states and mediates appropriate cellular responses such as secretion of paracrine signals and attenuation of proliferation. May mediate ths accumulation of intracellular inositol phosphates at acidic pH through proton-sensing activity.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
