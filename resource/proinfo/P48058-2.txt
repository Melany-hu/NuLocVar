UniprotID	P48058-2
Accession	P48058;Q86XE8
EntryName	GRIA4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutamate receptor 4 (GluR-4) (GluR4) (AMPA-selective glutamate receptor 4) (GluR-D) (Glutamate receptor ionotropic, AMPA 4)
GeneName	GRIA4 GluA4 GLUR4
Length	433
Function	Ionotropic glutamate receptor that functions as a ligand-gated cation channel, gated by L-glutamate and glutamatergic agonists such as alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), quisqualic acid, and kainic acid (By similarity). L-glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter at many synapses in the central nervous system and plays an important role in fast excitatory synaptic transmission (By similarity). Binding of the excitatory neurotransmitter L-glutamate induces a conformation change, leading to the opening of the cation channel, and thereby converts the chemical signal to an electrical impulse upon entry of monovalent and divalent cations such as sodium and calcium. The receptor then desensitizes rapidly and enters a transient inactive state, characterized by the presence of bound agonist (By similarity). In the presence of CACNG8, shows resensitization which is characterized by a delayed accumulation of current flux upon continued application of L-glutamate (PubMed:21172611).
