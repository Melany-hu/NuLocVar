EntryName	FCGRN_HUMAN
ProteinName	IgG receptor FcRn large subunit p51 (FcRn) (IgG Fc fragment receptor transporter alpha chain) (Neonatal Fc receptor)
GeneName	FCGRT FCRN
Length	365
Function	Cell surface receptor that transfers passive humoral immunity from the mother to the newborn. Binds to the Fc region of monomeric immunoglobulin gamma and mediates its selective uptake from milk (PubMed:10933786, PubMed:7964511). IgG in the milk is bound at the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium. The resultant FcRn-IgG complexes are transcytosed across the intestinal epithelium and IgG is released from FcRn into blood or tissue fluids. Throughout life, contributes to effective humoral immunity by recycling IgG and extending its half-life in the circulation. Mechanistically, monomeric IgG binding to FcRn in acidic endosomes of endothelial and hematopoietic cells recycles IgG to the cell surface where it is released into the circulation (PubMed:10998088). In addition of IgG, regulates homeostasis of the other most abundant circulating protein albumin/ALB (PubMed:24469444, PubMed:28330995).
