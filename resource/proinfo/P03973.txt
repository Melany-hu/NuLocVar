UniprotID	P03973
Accession	P03973;B2R5H8;P07757
EntryName	SLPI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Antileukoproteinase (ALP) (BLPI) (HUSI-1) (Mucus proteinase inhibitor) (MPI) (Protease inhibitor WAP4) (Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor) (Seminal proteinase inhibitor) (WAP four-disulfide core domain protein 4)
GeneName	SLPI WAP4 WFDC4
Length	132
Function	Acid-stable proteinase inhibitor with strong affinities for trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and cathepsin G (PubMed:10702419, PubMed:2039600, PubMed:2110563, PubMed:24121345, PubMed:3462719, PubMed:3533531). Modulates the inflammatory and immune responses after bacterial infection, and after infection by the intracellular parasite L.major. Down-regulates responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (By similarity). Plays a role in regulating the activation of NF-kappa-B and inflammatory responses (PubMed:10702419, PubMed:24352879). Has antimicrobial activity against mycobacteria, but not against salmonella. Contributes to normal resistance against infection by M.tuberculosis. Required for normal resistance to infection by L.major. Required for normal wound healing, probably by preventing tissue damage by limiting protease activity (By similarity). Together with ELANE, required for normal differentiation and proliferation of bone marrow myeloid cells (PubMed:24352879).
