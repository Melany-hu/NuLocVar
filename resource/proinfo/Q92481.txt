UniprotID	Q92481
Accession	Q92481;Q5JYX6;Q9NQ63;Q9NU99;Q9UJI7;Q9Y214;Q9Y3K3
EntryName	AP2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor AP-2-beta (AP2-beta) (Activating enhancer-binding protein 2-beta)
GeneName	TFAP2B
Length	460
Function	Sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that interacts with inducible viral and cellular enhancer elements to regulate transcription of selected genes. AP-2 factors bind to the consensus sequence 5'-GCCNNNGGC-3' and activate genes involved in a large spectrum of important biological functions including proper eye, face, body wall, limb and neural tube development. They also suppress a number of genes including MCAM/MUC18, C/EBP alpha and MYC. AP-2-beta appears to be required for normal face and limb development and for proper terminal differentiation and function of renal tubular epithelia.
