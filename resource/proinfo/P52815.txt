UniprotID	P52815
Accession	P52815;Q969U0;Q9HCA2;Q9UQJ3
EntryName	RM12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein bL12m (39S ribosomal protein L12, mitochondrial) (L12mt) (MRP-L12) (5c5-2) [Cleaved into: Large ribosomal subunit protein bL12m, long mature form; Large ribosomal subunit protein bL12m, short mature form]
GeneName	MRPL12 MRPL7 RPML12
Length	198
Function	As a component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit, plays a role in mitochondrial translation (PubMed:23603806). When present in mitochondria as a free protein not associated with the ribosome, associates with mitochondrial RNA polymerase POLRMT to activate transcription (PubMed:22003127). Required for POLRMT stability (PubMed:26586915).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
