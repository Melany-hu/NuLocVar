UniprotID	Q8WWV3
Accession	Q8WWV3;Q8N9B3;Q8WZ66;Q9BRA4
EntryName	RT4I1_HUMAN
ProteinName	NAD(P)H oxidoreductase RTN4IP1, mitochondrial (EC 1.6.5.-) (NOGO-interacting mitochondrial protein) (Reticulon-4-interacting protein 1)
GeneName	RTN4IP1 NIMP
Length	396
Function	NAD(P)H oxidoreductase involved in the ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway (PubMed:37884807). Required for the O-methyltransferase activity of COQ3 (PubMed:37884807). Able to catalyze the oxidoreduction of 3-demethylubiquinone into 3-demethylubiquinol in vitro (PubMed:37884807). However, it is unclear if 3-demethylubiquinone constitutes a substrate in vivo (PubMed:37884807). May also play a role in the regulation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurite outgrowth, and hence in the development of the inner retina and optic nerve (By similarity). Appears to be a potent inhibitor of regeneration following spinal cord injury (By similarity).
