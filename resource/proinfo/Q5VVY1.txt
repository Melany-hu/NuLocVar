UniprotID	Q5VVY1
Accession	Q5VVY1;B2RXI0
EntryName	NTM1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-terminal Xaa-Pro-Lys N-methyltransferase 2 (EC 2.1.1.299) (Alpha N-terminal protein methyltransferase 1B) (Methyltransferase-like protein 11B) (X-Pro-Lys N-terminal protein methyltransferase 1B) (NTM1B)
GeneName	NTMT2 C1orf184 METTL11B NRMT2
Length	283
Function	Alpha N-methyltransferase that methylates the N-terminus of target proteins containing the N-terminal motif -Pro-Lys when the initiator Met is cleaved. Specifically catalyzes monomethylation of exposed alpha-amino group of Ala or Ser residue in the -Pro-Lys motif and Pro in the Pro-Pro-Lys motif (PubMed:24090352, PubMed:30417120). Predominantly functions as a mono-methyltransferase but is also able to di-/tri-methylate the GPKRIA peptide and di-methylate the PPKRIA peptide (in vitro) (PubMed:30417120). May activate NTMT1 by priming its substrates for trimethylation (PubMed:24090352).
