UniprotID	O75223
Accession	O75223;B2RDN0;B8ZZN4;B8ZZR8;Q9BS37
EntryName	GGCT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase (EC 4.3.2.9) (Cytochrome c-releasing factor 21)
GeneName	GGCT C7orf24 CRF21
Length	188
Function	Catalyzes the formation of 5-oxoproline from gamma-glutamyl dipeptides and may play a significant role in glutathione homeostasis (PubMed:18515354). Induces release of cytochrome c from mitochondria with resultant induction of apoptosis (PubMed:16765912).
