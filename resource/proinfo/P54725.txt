UniprotID	P54725
Accession	P54725;K7ESE3;Q59EU8;Q5M7Z1
EntryName	RD23A_HUMAN
ProteinName	UV excision repair protein RAD23 homolog A (HR23A) (hHR23A)
GeneName	RAD23A
Length	363
Function	Multiubiquitin chain receptor involved in modulation of proteasomal degradation. Binds to 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains in a length-dependent manner and with a lower affinity to 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains. Proposed to be capable to bind simultaneously to the 26S proteasome and to polyubiquitinated substrates and to deliver ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
