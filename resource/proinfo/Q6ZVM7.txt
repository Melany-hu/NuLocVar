EntryName	TM1L2_HUMAN
ProteinName	TOM1-like protein 2 (Target of Myb-like protein 2)
GeneName	TOM1L2
Length	507
Function	Acts as a MYO6/Myosin VI adapter protein that targets myosin VI to endocytic structures (PubMed:23023224). May also play a role in recruiting clathrin to endosomes (PubMed:16412388). May regulate growth factor-induced mitogenic signaling (PubMed:16479011).
