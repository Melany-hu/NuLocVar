UniprotID	P37837
Accession	P37837;B2R8M2;O00751;Q8WV32;Q8WZ45
EntryName	TALDO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transaldolase (EC 2.2.1.2)
GeneName	TALDO1 TAL TALDO TALDOR
Length	337
Function	Catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the non-oxidative phase in the pentose phosphate pathway. Catalyzes the reversible conversion of sedheptulose-7-phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into erythrose-4-phosphate and beta-D-fructose 6-phosphate (PubMed:18687684, PubMed:8955144). Not only acts as a pentose phosphate pathway enzyme, but also affects other metabolite pathways by altering its subcellular localization between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (By similarity).
