UniprotID	Q9UJ90
Accession	Q9UJ90;Q5JWV7
EntryName	KCNE5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory beta subunit 5 (AMME syndrome candidate gene 2 protein) (Potassium channel subunit beta MiRP4) (Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 1-like protein)
GeneName	KCNE5 AMMECR2 KCNE1L
Length	142
Function	Potassium channel ancillary subunit that is essential for generation of some native K(+) currents by virtue of formation of heteromeric ion channel complex with voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel pore-forming alpha subunits. Functions as an inhibitory beta-subunit of the repolarizing cardiac potassium ion channel KCNQ1.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
