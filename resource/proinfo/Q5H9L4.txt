UniprotID	Q5H9L4
Accession	Q5H9L4;Q5H9L6;Q86XI4;Q9BXU5;Q9H5R0
EntryName	TAF7L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 7-like (Cancer/testis antigen 40) (CT40) (RNA polymerase II TBP-associated factor subunit Q) (TATA box-binding protein-associated factor 50 kDa) (Transcription initiation factor TFIID 50 kDa subunit)
GeneName	TAF7L TAF2Q
Length	462
Function	Probably functions as a spermatogenesis-specific component of the DNA-binding general transcription factor complex TFIID, a multimeric protein complex that plays a central role in mediating promoter responses to various activators and repressors. May play a role in spermatogenesis (By similarity).
