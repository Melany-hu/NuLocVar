UniprotID	P41247
Accession	P41247;A8K1H3;B4E362;Q8WW83
EntryName	PLPL4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 4 (EC 3.1.1.3) (Calcium-independent phospholipase A2-eta) (iPLA2-eta) (EC 3.1.1.4) (Protein GS2)
GeneName	PNPLA4 DXS1283E GS2
Length	253
Function	Has abundant triacylglycerol lipase activity (PubMed:15364929, PubMed:16150821, PubMed:17603008). Transfers fatty acid from triglyceride to retinol, hydrolyzes retinylesters, and generates 1,3-diacylglycerol from triglycerides (PubMed:17603008). Additionally possesses acylglycerol transacylase and phospholipase A2 activities (PubMed:15364929, PubMed:17603008).
