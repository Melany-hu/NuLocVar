EntryName	JUN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor Jun (Activator protein 1) (AP1) (Proto-oncogene c-Jun) (Transcription factor AP-1 subunit Jun) (V-jun avian sarcoma virus 17 oncogene homolog) (p39)
GeneName	JUN
Length	331
Function	Transcription factor that recognizes and binds to the AP-1 consensus motif 5'-TGATCA-3' (PubMed:10995748, PubMed:22083952). Heterodimerizes with proteins of the FOS family to form an AP-1 transcription complex, thereby enhancing its DNA binding activity to the AP-1 consensus sequence 5'-TGATCA-3' and enhancing its transcriptional activity (By similarity). Together with FOSB, plays a role in activation-induced cell death of T cells by binding to the AP-1 promoter site of FASLG/CD95L, and inducing its transcription in response to activation of the TCR/CD3 signaling pathway (PubMed:12618758). Promotes activity of NR5A1 when phosphorylated by HIPK3 leading to increased steroidogenic gene expression upon cAMP signaling pathway stimulation (PubMed:17210646). Involved in activated KRAS-mediated transcriptional activation of USP28 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306). Binds to the USP28 promoter in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306).
