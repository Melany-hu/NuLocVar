EntryName	RAE1L_HUMAN
ProteinName	mRNA export factor RAE1 (Rae1 protein homolog) (mRNA-associated protein mrnp 41)
GeneName	RAE1 MRNP41
Length	368
Function	Acts as a mRNA export factor involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport (PubMed:20498086, PubMed:33849972). Plays a role in mitotic bipolar spindle formation (PubMed:17172455). May function in attaching cytoplasmic mRNPs to the cytoskeleton both directly or indirectly (PubMed:17172455).
