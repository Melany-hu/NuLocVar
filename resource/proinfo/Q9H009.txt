UniprotID	Q9H009
Accession	Q9H009;Q2VIR9
EntryName	NACA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit alpha-2 (Alpha-NAC-like) (Hom s 2.01) (Nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit alpha-like) (NAC-alpha-like)
GeneName	NACA2 NACAL
Length	215
Function	Prevents inappropriate targeting of non-secretory polypeptides to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Binds to nascent polypeptide chains as they emerge from the ribosome and blocks their interaction with the signal recognition particle (SRP), which normally targets nascent secretory peptides to the ER. Also reduces the inherent affinity of ribosomes for protein translocation sites in the ER membrane (M sites) (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus
