UniprotID	Q8NBQ7
Accession	Q8NBQ7
EntryName	AQP11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aquaporin-11 (AQP-11)
GeneName	AQP11 AQPX1 PSEC0027
Length	271
Function	Channel protein that facilitates the transport of water, glycerol and hydrogen peroxide across membrane of cell or organelles guaranteeing intracellular homeostasis in several organes like liver, kidney and brain (PubMed:24845055, PubMed:24918044, PubMed:31546170). In situation of stress, participates in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis by regulating redox homeostasis through the transport of hydrogen peroxide across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane thereby regulating the oxidative stress through the NADPH oxidase 2 pathway (PubMed:31546170). Plays a role by maintaining an environment suitable for translation or protein foldings in the ER lumen namely by participating in the PKD1 glycosylation processing resulting in regulation of PKD1 membrane trafficking thereby preventing the accumulation of unfolding protein in ER (By similarity). Plays a role in the proximal tubule function by regulating its endosomal acidification (By similarity). May play a role in postnatal kidney development (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Cell membrane
