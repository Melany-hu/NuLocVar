EntryName	S38A3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 3 (N-system amino acid transporter 1) (Na(+)-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 3) (Solute carrier family 38 member 3) (System N amino acid transporter 1)
GeneName	SLC38A3 G17 NAT1 SN1 SNAT3
Length	504
Function	Symporter that cotransports specific neutral amino acids and sodium ions, coupled to an H(+) antiporter activity (PubMed:10823827). Mainly participates in the glutamate-GABA-glutamine cycle in brain where it transports L-glutamine from astrocytes in the intercellular space for the replenishment of both neurotransmitters glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in neurons and also functions as the major influx transporter in ganglion cells mediating the uptake of glutamine (By similarity). The transport activity is specific for L-glutamine, L-histidine and L-asparagine (PubMed:10823827). The transport is electroneutral coupled to the cotransport of 1 Na(+) and the antiport of 1 H(+) (By similarity). The transport is pH dependent, saturable, Li(+) tolerant and functions in both direction depending on the concentration gradients of its substrates and cotransported ions (PubMed:10823827). Also mediates an amino acid-gated H(+) conductance that is not stoichiometrically coupled to the amino acid transport but which influences the ionic gradients that drive the amino acid transport (By similarity). In addition, may play a role in nitrogen metabolism, amino acid homeostasis, glucose metabolism and renal ammoniagenesis (By similarity).
