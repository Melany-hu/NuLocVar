UniprotID	O15212
Accession	O15212
EntryName	PFD6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prefoldin subunit 6 (Protein Ke2)
GeneName	PFDN6 HKE2 PFD6
Length	129
Function	Binds specifically to cytosolic chaperonin (c-CPN) and transfers target proteins to it. Binds to nascent polypeptide chain and promotes folding in an environment in which there are many competing pathways for nonnative proteins.
