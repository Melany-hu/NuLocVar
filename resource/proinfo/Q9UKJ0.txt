UniprotID	Q9UKJ0
Accession	Q9UKJ0;Q69YF9;Q9HBS0
EntryName	PILRB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor beta (Activating receptor PILR-beta) (Cell surface receptor FDFACT)
GeneName	PILRB FDFACT PP1551
Length	227
Function	Paired receptors consist of highly related activating and inhibitory receptors and are widely involved in the regulation of the immune system. PILRB is thought to act as a cellular signaling activating receptor that associates with ITAM-bearing adapter molecules on the cell surface.
