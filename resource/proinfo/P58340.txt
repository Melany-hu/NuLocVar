UniprotID	P58340
Accession	P58340;E9PEU9;Q2TLE3;Q2TLE5;Q8N8F8;Q96MH1
EntryName	MLF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myeloid leukemia factor 1 (Myelodysplasia-myeloid leukemia factor 1)
GeneName	MLF1
Length	268
Function	Involved in lineage commitment of primary hemopoietic progenitors by restricting erythroid formation and enhancing myeloid formation. Interferes with erythropoietin-induced erythroid terminal differentiation by preventing cells from exiting the cell cycle through suppression of CDKN1B/p27Kip1 levels. Suppresses COP1 activity via CSN3 which activates p53 and induces cell cycle arrest. Binds DNA and affects the expression of a number of genes so may function as a transcription factor in the nucleus.
