UniprotID	Q9Y2Q3
Accession	Q9Y2Q3;B4DIH1;B4DSY2;Q6P4H0;Q7Z520;Q9P1S4
EntryName	GSTK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutathione S-transferase kappa 1 (EC 2.5.1.18) (GST 13-13) (GST class-kappa) (GSTK1-1) (hGSTK1) (Glutathione S-transferase subunit 13)
GeneName	GSTK1 HDCMD47P
Length	226
Function	Glutathione S-transferase that catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione to exogenous and endogenous compounds (PubMed:14709161, PubMed:14742434). Significant glutathione conjugating activity is found only with the model substrate, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) (PubMed:14709161).
