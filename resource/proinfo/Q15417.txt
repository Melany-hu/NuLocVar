UniprotID	Q15417
Accession	Q15417;B4DFK6;B4DP09;F8WA86;Q6FHA7
EntryName	CNN3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calponin-3 (Calponin, acidic isoform)
GeneName	CNN3
Length	329
Function	Thin filament-associated protein that is implicated in the regulation and modulation of smooth muscle contraction. It is capable of binding to actin, calmodulin and tropomyosin. The interaction of calponin with actin inhibits the actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity.
