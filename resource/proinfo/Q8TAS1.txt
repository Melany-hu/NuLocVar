UniprotID	Q8TAS1
Accession	Q8TAS1;A0A0A6YYC2;A8K8K4;G3V1M1;Q96C22
EntryName	UHMK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase Kist (EC 2.7.11.1) (Kinase interacting with stathmin) (PAM COOH-terminal interactor protein 2) (P-CIP2) (U2AF homology motif kinase 1)
GeneName	UHMK1 KIS KIST
Length	419
Function	Upon serum stimulation, phosphorylates CDKN1B/p27Kip1, thus controlling CDKN1B subcellular location and cell cycle progression in G1 phase. May be involved in trafficking and/or processing of RNA (By similarity).
