UniprotID	P17535
Accession	P17535;Q53EK9
EntryName	JUND_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor JunD (Transcription factor AP-1 subunit JunD)
GeneName	JUND
Length	347
Function	Transcription factor binding AP-1 sites (PubMed:9989505). Heterodimerizes with proteins of the FOS family to form an AP-1 transcription factor complex, thereby enhancing their DNA binding activity to an AP-1 consensus sequence 3'-TGATCA-5' and enhancing their transcriptional activity (PubMed:28981703, PubMed:9989505).
