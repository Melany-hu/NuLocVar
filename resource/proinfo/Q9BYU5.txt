UniprotID	Q9BYU5
Accession	Q9BYU5
EntryName	KRA21_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 2-1 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 2.1) (Keratin-associated protein 2.1)
GeneName	KRTAP2-1 KAP2.1 KRTAP2.1A KRTAP2.1B
Length	128
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins (By similarity).
