UniprotID	P13726
Accession	P13726;D3DT47;Q6FHG2;Q86WH4
EntryName	TF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tissue factor (TF) (Coagulation factor III) (Thromboplastin) (CD antigen CD142)
GeneName	F3
Length	295
Function	Initiates blood coagulation by forming a complex with circulating factor VII or VIIa. The  complex activates factors IX or X by specific limited proteolysis. TF plays a role in normal hemostasis by initiating the cell-surface assembly and propagation of the coagulation protease cascade.
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Secreted
