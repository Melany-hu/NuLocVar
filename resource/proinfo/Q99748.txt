Accession	Q99748;B2RPE8
EntryName	NRTN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neurturin
GeneName	NRTN
Length	197
Function	Growth factor that supports the survival of sympathetic neurons in culture (PubMed:8945474). May regulate the development and maintenance of the CNS (PubMed:8945474). Involved in the development of the neural crest (PubMed:15242795). Might control the size of non-neuronal cell population such as haemopoietic cells (PubMed:8945474). Acts by binding to its coreceptor, GFRA2, leading to autophosphorylation and activation of the RET receptor (PubMed:10829012, PubMed:29414779, PubMed:31535977). Heparan sulfate-binding is required for signaling (PubMed:29414779).
