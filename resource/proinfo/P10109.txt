UniprotID	P10109
Accession	P10109;B0YJ14;Q53YD6
EntryName	ADX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adrenodoxin, mitochondrial (Adrenal ferredoxin) (Ferredoxin-1) (Hepatoredoxin)
GeneName	FDX1 ADX
Length	184
Function	Essential for the synthesis of various steroid hormones (PubMed:20547883, PubMed:21636783). Participates in the reduction of mitochondrial cytochrome P450 for steroidogenesis (PubMed:20547883, PubMed:21636783). Transfers electrons from adrenodoxin reductase to CYP11A1, a cytochrome P450 that catalyzes cholesterol side-chain cleavage (PubMed:20547883, PubMed:21636783). Does not form a ternary complex with adrenodoxin reductase and CYP11A1 but shuttles between the two enzymes to transfer electrons (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
