UniprotID	Q14469
Accession	Q14469;Q6FHB2
EntryName	HES1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor HES-1 (Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 39) (bHLHb39) (Hairy and enhancer of split 1) (Hairy homolog) (Hairy-like protein) (hHL)
GeneName	HES1 BHLHB39 HL HRY
Length	280
Function	Transcriptional repressor of genes that require a bHLH protein for their transcription. May act as a negative regulator of myogenesis by inhibiting the functions of MYOD1 and ASH1. Binds DNA on N-box motifs: 5'-CACNAG-3' with high affinity and on E-box motifs: 5'-CANNTG-3' with low affinity (By similarity). May play a role in a functional FA core complex response to DNA cross-link damage, being required for the stability and nuclear localization of FA core complex proteins, as well as for FANCD2 monoubiquitination in response to DNA damage.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
