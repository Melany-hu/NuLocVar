UniprotID	P25325
Accession	P25325;A8MZ34;B3KP52;J3KPV7;O75750;Q6FHN9
EntryName	THTM_HUMAN
ProteinName	3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) (EC 2.8.1.2)
GeneName	MPST TST2
Length	297
Function	Transfer of a sulfur ion to cyanide or to other thiol compounds. Also has weak rhodanese activity. Detoxifies cyanide and is required for thiosulfate biosynthesis. Acts as an antioxidant. In combination with cysteine aminotransferase (CAT), contributes to the catabolism of cysteine and is an important producer of hydrogen sulfide in the brain, retina and vascular endothelial cells. Hydrogen sulfide H(2)S is an important synaptic modulator, signaling molecule, smooth muscle contractor and neuroprotectant. Its production by the 3MST/CAT pathway is regulated by calcium ions.
