UniprotID	Q96P68
Accession	Q96P68;Q5T5A7;Q86TL1
EntryName	OXGR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	2-oxoglutarate receptor 1 (Alpha-ketoglutarate receptor 1) (G-protein coupled receptor 80) (G-protein coupled receptor 99) (P2Y purinoceptor 15) (P2Y15) (P2Y-like GPCR) (P2Y-like nucleotide receptor)
GeneName	OXGR1 GPR80 GPR99 P2RY15 P2Y15
Length	337
Function	G protein-coupled receptor for dicarboxylates and amino dicarboxylates (PubMed:15141213, PubMed:36571463, PubMed:36919698). Receptor for itaconate, a metabolite produced by myeloid lineages (PubMed:36919698). In the respiratory epithelium, couples the binding of itaconate to the activation of GNA11 and downstream intracellular Ca(2+) release, leading to mucocilliary clearance of airborne pathogens (PubMed:36919698). Receptor for leukotriene E4 (LTE4) produced by mast cells upon allergic inflammation. Binds with high affinity to LTE4 and elicits mucin release from pulmonary epithelium in response to airborne fungi allergens. Regulates mucin-producing goblet cell homeostasis (By similarity). Receptor for alpha-ketoglutarate produced by proximal tubule renal cells upon metabolic alkalosis. In an intrarenal paracrine signaling pathway, binds alpha-ketoglutarate and drives transepithelial salt reabsorption and bicarbonate secretion by SLC26A4/pendrin-positive intercalated cells (By similarity) (PubMed:15141213).
