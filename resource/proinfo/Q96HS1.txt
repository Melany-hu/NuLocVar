UniprotID	Q96HS1
Accession	Q96HS1;A9LN06;C9IZY7;Q96JB0
EntryName	PGAM5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PGAM5, mitochondrial (EC 3.1.3.16) (Bcl-XL-binding protein v68) (Phosphoglycerate mutase family member 5)
GeneName	PGAM5
Length	289
Function	Mitochondrial serine/threonine phosphatase that dephosphorylates various substrates and thus plays a role in different biological processes including cellular senescence or mitophagy (PubMed:24746696, PubMed:32439975). Modulates cellular senescence by regulating mitochondrial dynamics. Mechanistically, participates in mitochondrial fission through dephosphorylating DNM1L/DRP1 (PubMed:32439975). Additionally, dephosphorylates MFN2 in a stress-sensitive manner and consequently protects it from ubiquitination and degradation to promote mitochondrial network formation (PubMed:37498743). Regulates mitophagy independent of PARKIN by interacting with and dephosphorylating FUNDC1, which interacts with LC3 (PubMed:24746696). Regulates anti-oxidative response by forming a tertiary complex with KEAP1 and NRF2 (PubMed:18387606). Regulates necroptosis by acting as a RIPK3 target and recruiting the RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL necrosis 'attack' complex to mitochondria (PubMed:22265414).
