Function	Polyol dehydrogenase that catalyzes the reversible NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of various sugar alcohols. Is mostly active with D-sorbitol (D-glucitol), L-threitol, xylitol and ribitol as substrates, leading to the C2-oxidized products D-fructose, L-erythrulose, D-xylulose, and D-ribulose, respectively (PubMed:3365415). Is a key enzyme in the polyol pathway that interconverts glucose and fructose via sorbitol, which constitutes an important alternate route for glucose metabolism. The polyol pathway is believed to be involved in the etiology of diabetic complications, such as diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy, induced by hyperglycemia (PubMed:12962626, PubMed:25105142, PubMed:29966615). May play a role in sperm motility by using sorbitol as an alternative energy source for sperm motility (PubMed:16278369). May have a more general function in the metabolism of secondary alcohols since it also catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol. To a lesser extent, can also oxidize L-arabinitol, galactitol and D-mannitol and glycerol in vitro. Oxidizes neither ethanol nor other primary alcohols. Cannot use NADP(+) as the electron acceptor (PubMed:3365415).
