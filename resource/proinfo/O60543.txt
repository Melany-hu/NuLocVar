ProteinName	Lipid transferase CIDEA (Cell death activator CIDE-A) (Cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector A)
GeneName	CIDEA
Length	219
Function	Lipid transferase that promotes unilocular lipid droplet formation by mediating lipid droplet fusion (PubMed:19843876, PubMed:26118629). Lipid droplet fusion promotes their enlargement, restricting lipolysis and favoring lipid storage (PubMed:19843876). Localizes on the lipid droplet surface, at focal contact sites between lipid droplets, and mediates atypical lipid droplet fusion by promoting directional net neutral lipid transfer from the smaller to larger lipid droplets (By similarity). The transfer direction may be driven by the internal pressure difference between the contacting lipid droplet pair and occurs at a lower rate than that promoted by CIDEC (By similarity). May also act as a CEBPB coactivator in epithelial cells to control the expression of a subset of CEBPB downstream target genes, including ID2, IGF1, PRLR, SOCS1, SOCS3, XDH, but not casein (By similarity). By interacting with CEBPB, strengthens the association of CEBPB with the XDH promoter, increases histone acetylation and dissociates HDAC1 from the promoter (By similarity). When overexpressed, induces apoptosis; the physiological significance of its role in apoptosis is unclear (By similarity).
