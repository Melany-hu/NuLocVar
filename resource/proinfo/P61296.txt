UniprotID	P61296
Accession	P61296;B6ECG9;O95300;O95301;P97833;Q494T1
EntryName	HAND2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heart- and neural crest derivatives-expressed protein 2 (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 26) (bHLHa26) (Deciduum, heart, autonomic nervous system and neural crest derivatives-expressed protein 2) (dHAND)
GeneName	HAND2 BHLHA26 DHAND
Length	217
Function	Essential for cardiac morphogenesis, particularly for the formation of the right ventricle and of the aortic arch arteries. Required for vascular development and regulation of angiogenesis, possibly through a VEGF signaling pathway. Also plays an important role in limb development, particularly in the establishment of anterior-posterior polarization, acting as an upstream regulator of sonic hedgehog (SHH) induction in the limb bud. Is involved in the development of branchial arches, which give rise to unique structures in the head and neck. Binds DNA on E-box consensus sequence 5'-CANNTG-3' (By similarity).
