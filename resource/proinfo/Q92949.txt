UniprotID	Q92949
Accession	Q92949;O00630
EntryName	FOXJ1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Forkhead box protein J1 (Forkhead-related protein FKHL13) (Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 forkhead homolog 4) (HFH-4)
GeneName	FOXJ1 FKHL13 HFH4
Length	421
Function	Transcription factor specifically required for the formation of motile cilia (PubMed:31630787). Acts by activating transcription of genes that mediate assembly of motile cilia, such as CFAP157. Binds the DNA consensus sequences 5'-HWDTGTTTGTTTA-3' or 5'-KTTTGTTGTTKTW-3' (where H is not G, W is A or T, D is not C, and K is G or T). Activates the transcription of a variety of ciliary proteins in the developing brain and lung.
