EntryName	PPAP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) (EC 3.1.3.2) (5'-nucleotidase) (5'-NT) (EC 3.1.3.5) (Acid phosphatase 3) (Ecto-5'-nucleotidase) (Protein tyrosine phosphatase ACP3) (EC 3.1.3.48) (Thiamine monophosphatase) (TMPase) [Cleaved into: PAPf39]
GeneName	ACP3 ACPP
Length	386
Function	A non-specific tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates a diverse number of substrates under acidic conditions (pH 4-6) including alkyl, aryl, and acyl orthophosphate monoesters and phosphorylated proteins (PubMed:10506173, PubMed:15280042, PubMed:20498373, PubMed:9584846). Has lipid phosphatase activity and inactivates lysophosphatidic acid in seminal plasma (PubMed:10506173, PubMed:15280042).
