UniprotID	Q9H4B4
Accession	Q9H4B4;Q15767;Q5JR99;Q96CV1
EntryName	PLK3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase PLK3 (EC 2.7.11.21) (Cytokine-inducible serine/threonine-protein kinase) (FGF-inducible kinase) (Polo-like kinase 3) (PLK-3) (Proliferation-related kinase)
GeneName	PLK3 CNK FNK PRK
Length	646
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in cell cycle regulation, response to stress and Golgi disassembly. Polo-like kinases act by binding and phosphorylating proteins that are already phosphorylated on a specific motif recognized by the POLO box domains. Phosphorylates ATF2, BCL2L1, CDC25A, CDC25C, CHEK2, HIF1A, JUN, p53/TP53, p73/TP73, PTEN, TOP2A and VRK1. Involved in cell cycle regulation: required for entry into S phase and cytokinesis. Phosphorylates BCL2L1, leading to regulate the G2 checkpoint and progression to cytokinesis during mitosis. Plays a key role in response to stress: rapidly activated upon stress stimulation, such as ionizing radiation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), hyperosmotic stress, UV irradiation and hypoxia. Involved in DNA damage response and G1/S transition checkpoint by phosphorylating CDC25A, p53/TP53 and p73/TP73. Phosphorylates p53/TP53 in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby promoting p53/TP53-mediated apoptosis. Phosphorylates CHEK2 in response to DNA damage, promoting the G2/M transition checkpoint. Phosphorylates the transcription factor p73/TP73 in response to DNA damage, leading to inhibit p73/TP73-mediated transcriptional activation and pro-apoptotic functions. Phosphorylates HIF1A and JUN is response to hypoxia. Phosphorylates ATF2 following hyperosmotic stress in corneal epithelium. Also involved in Golgi disassembly during the cell cycle: part of a MEK1/MAP2K1-dependent pathway that induces Golgi fragmentation during mitosis by mediating phosphorylation of VRK1. May participate in endomitotic cell cycle, a form of mitosis in which both karyokinesis and cytokinesis are interrupted and is a hallmark of megakaryocyte differentiation, via its interaction with CIB1.
