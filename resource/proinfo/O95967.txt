EntryName	FBLN4_HUMAN
ProteinName	EGF-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 2 (Fibulin-4) (FIBL-4) (Protein UPH1)
GeneName	EFEMP2 FBLN4 UNQ200/PRO226
Length	443
Function	Plays a crucial role in elastic fiber formation in tissue, and in the formation of ultrastructural connections between elastic laminae and smooth muscle cells in the aorta, therefore participates in terminal differentiation and maturation of smooth muscle cell (SMC) and in the mechanical properties and wall integrity maintenance of the aorta (PubMed:27339457). In addition, is involved in the control of collagen fibril assembly in tissue throught proteolytic activation of LOX leading to cross- linking of collagen and elastin (By similarity). Also promotes ELN coacervation and participates in the deposition of ELN coacervates on to microfibrils but also regulates ELN cross- linking through LOX interaction (PubMed:18973305, PubMed:19570982). Moreover adheres to the cells through heparin binding in a calcium-dependent manner and regulates vascularlar smooth muscle cells proliferation through angiotensin signaling (PubMed:23782690).
