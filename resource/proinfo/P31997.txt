UniprotID	P31997
Accession	P31997;O60399;Q16574
EntryName	CEAM8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cell adhesion molecule CEACAM8 (CD67 antigen) (Carcinoembryonic antigen CGM6) (Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 8) (CEA cell adhesion molecule 8) (Non-specific cross-reacting antigen NCA-95) (CD antigen CD66b)
GeneName	CEACAM8 CGM6
Length	349
Function	Cell surface glycoprotein that plays a role in cell adhesion in a calcium-independent manner (PubMed:11590190, PubMed:2022629, PubMed:8776764). Mediates heterophilic cell adhesion with other carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules, such as CEACAM6 (PubMed:11590190, PubMed:2022629, PubMed:8776764). Heterophilic interaction with CEACAM8 occurs in activated neutrophils (PubMed:8776764).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell surface
