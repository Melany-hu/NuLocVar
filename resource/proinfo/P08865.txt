UniprotID	P08865
Accession	P08865;P11085;P12030;Q16471;Q6IPD1;Q6IPD2;Q6NSD1;Q6NXQ8;Q86VC0
EntryName	RSSA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein uS2 (37 kDa laminin receptor precursor) (37LRP) (37/67 kDa laminin receptor) (LRP/LR) (40S ribosomal protein SA) (67 kDa laminin receptor) (67LR) (Colon carcinoma laminin-binding protein) (Laminin receptor 1) (LamR) (Laminin-binding protein precursor p40) (LBP/p40) (Multidrug resistance-associated protein MGr1-Ag) (NEM/1CHD4)
GeneName	RPSA LAMBR LAMR1
Length	295
Function	Required for the assembly and/or stability of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Required for the processing of the 20S rRNA-precursor to mature 18S rRNA in a late step of the maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits. Also functions as a cell surface receptor for laminin. Plays a role in cell adhesion to the basement membrane and in the consequent activation of signaling transduction pathways. May play a role in cell fate determination and tissue morphogenesis. Acts as a PPP1R16B-dependent substrate of PPP1CA.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Nucleus
