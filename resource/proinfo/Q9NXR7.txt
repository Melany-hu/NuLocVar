EntryName	BABA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	BRISC and BRCA1-A complex member 2 (BRCA1-A complex subunit BRE) (BRCA1/BRCA2-containing complex subunit 45) (Brain and reproductive organ-expressed protein)
GeneName	BABAM2 BRCC45 BRE
Length	383
Function	Component of the BRCA1-A complex, a complex that specifically recognizes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitinated histones H2A and H2AX at DNA lesions sites, leading to target the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer to sites of DNA damage at double-strand breaks (DSBs). The BRCA1-A complex also possesses deubiquitinase activity that specifically removes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin on histones H2A and H2AX (PubMed:17525341, PubMed:19261746, PubMed:19261748, PubMed:19261749). In the BRCA1-A complex, it acts as an adapter that bridges the interaction between BABAM1/NBA1 and the rest of the complex, thereby being required for the complex integrity and modulating the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer (PubMed:19261748, PubMed:21282113). Component of the BRISC complex, a multiprotein complex that specifically cleaves 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin in various substrates (PubMed:19214193, PubMed:24075985, PubMed:25283148, PubMed:26195665). Within the BRISC complex, acts as an adapter that bridges the interaction between BABAM1/NBA1 and the rest of the complex, thereby being required for the complex integrity (PubMed:21282113). The BRISC complex is required for normal mitotic spindle assembly and microtubule attachment to kinetochores via its role in deubiquitinating NUMA1 (PubMed:26195665). The BRISC complex plays a role in interferon signaling via its role in the deubiquitination of the interferon receptor IFNAR1; deubiquitination increases IFNAR1 activity by enhancing its stability and cell surface expression (PubMed:24075985). Down-regulates the response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via its role in IFNAR1 deubiquitination (PubMed:24075985). May play a role in homeostasis or cellular differentiation in cells of neural, epithelial and germline origins. May also act as a death receptor-associated anti-apoptotic protein, which inhibits the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. May regulate TNF-alpha signaling through its interactions with TNFRSF1A; however these effects may be indirect (PubMed:15465831).
