EntryName	1433S_HUMAN
ProteinName	14-3-3 protein sigma (Epithelial cell marker protein 1) (Stratifin)
GeneName	SFN HME1
Length	248
Function	Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathways (PubMed:15731107, PubMed:22634725, PubMed:28202711, PubMed:37797010). Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif (PubMed:15731107, PubMed:22634725, PubMed:28202711, PubMed:37797010). Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner (PubMed:15731107, PubMed:22634725, PubMed:28202711, PubMed:37797010). Promotes cytosolic retention of GBP1 GTPase by binding to phosphorylated GBP1, thereby inhibiting the innate immune response (PubMed:37797010). Also acts as a TP53/p53-regulated inhibitor of G2/M progression (PubMed:9659898). When bound to KRT17, regulates protein synthesis and epithelial cell growth by stimulating Akt/mTOR pathway (By similarity). Acts to maintain desmosome cell junction adhesion in epithelial cells via interacting with and sequestering PKP3 to the cytoplasm, thereby restricting its translocation to existing desmosome structures and therefore maintaining desmosome protein homeostasis (PubMed:24124604). Also acts to facilitate PKP3 exchange at desmosome plaques, thereby maintaining keratinocyte intercellular adhesion (PubMed:29678907). May also regulate MDM2 autoubiquitination and degradation and thereby activate p53/TP53 (PubMed:18382127).
