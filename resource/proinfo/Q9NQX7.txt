UniprotID	Q9NQX7
Accession	Q9NQX7;B3KPG4;Q4G0A8;Q53H84;Q6IAE7;Q86VK5;Q8N288;Q8TAW0;Q9BUP8
EntryName	ITM2C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Integral membrane protein 2C (Cerebral protein 14) (Transmembrane protein BRI3) [Cleaved into: CT-BRI3]
GeneName	ITM2C BRI3 hucep-14 NPD018 PSEC0047
Length	267
Function	Negative regulator of amyloid-beta peptide production. May inhibit the processing of APP by blocking its access to alpha- and beta-secretase. Binding to the beta-secretase-cleaved APP C-terminal fragment is negligible, suggesting that ITM2C is a poor gamma-secretase cleavage inhibitor. May play a role in TNF-induced cell death and neuronal differentiation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane; Cell membrane
