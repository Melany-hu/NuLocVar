UniprotID	Q14181
Accession	Q14181;B4DNB4;Q9BPV3
EntryName	DPOA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA polymerase alpha subunit B (DNA polymerase alpha 70 kDa subunit)
GeneName	POLA2
Length	598
Function	Accessory subunit of the DNA polymerase alpha complex (also known as the alpha DNA polymerase-primase complex) which plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA synthesis (PubMed:9705292). During the S phase of the cell cycle, the DNA polymerase alpha complex (composed of a catalytic subunit POLA1, an accessory subunit POLA2 and two primase subunits, the catalytic subunit PRIM1 and the regulatory subunit PRIM2) is recruited to DNA at the replicative forks via direct interactions with MCM10 and WDHD1 (By similarity). The primase subunit of the polymerase alpha complex initiates DNA synthesis by oligomerising short RNA primers on both leading and lagging strands (By similarity). These primers are initially extended by the polymerase alpha catalytic subunit and subsequently transferred to polymerase delta and polymerase epsilon for processive synthesis on the lagging and leading strand, respectively (By similarity).
