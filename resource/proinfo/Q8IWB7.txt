UniprotID	Q8IWB7
Accession	Q8IWB7;Q53S17;Q9H9D5;Q9P2B3
EntryName	WDFY1_HUMAN
ProteinName	WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (FYVE domain-containing protein localized to endosomes 1) (FENS-1) (Phosphoinositide-binding protein 1) (WD40- and FYVE domain-containing protein 1) (Zinc finger FYVE domain-containing protein 17)
GeneName	WDFY1 FENS1 KIAA1435 WDF1 ZFYVE17
Length	410
Function	Positively regulates TLR3- and TLR4-mediated signaling pathways by bridging the interaction between TLR3 or TLR4 and TICAM1. Promotes TLR3/4 ligand-induced activation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-kappa-B, as well as the production of IFN-beta and inflammatory cytokines (PubMed:25736436).
Subcellular Location	Early endosome
