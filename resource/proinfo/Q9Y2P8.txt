UniprotID	Q9Y2P8
Accession	Q9Y2P8;D3DRI2;Q5VYW9;Q5VZU1;Q9H9D0;Q9NY00;Q9P044
EntryName	RCL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA 3'-terminal phosphate cyclase-like protein
GeneName	RCL1 RNAC RPC2 RPCL1 RTC2 HSPC338
Length	373
Function	As part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, it plays a role in 40S-ribosomal-subunit biogenesis in the early pre-rRNA processing steps at sites A0, A1 and A2 that are required for proper maturation of the 18S RNA (By similarity). Activates BMS1 by promoting GDP/GTP exchange (By similarity). Does not have cyclase activity (By similarity).
