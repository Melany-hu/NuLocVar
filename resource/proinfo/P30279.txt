UniprotID	P30279
Accession	P30279;A8K531;Q13955;Q5U035
EntryName	CCND2_HUMAN
ProteinName	G1/S-specific cyclin-D2
GeneName	CCND2
Length	289
Function	Regulatory component of the cyclin D2-CDK4 (DC) complex that phosphorylates and inhibits members of the retinoblastoma (RB) protein family including RB1 and regulates the cell-cycle during G(1)/S transition (PubMed:18827403, PubMed:8114739). Phosphorylation of RB1 allows dissociation of the transcription factor E2F from the RB/E2F complex and the subsequent transcription of E2F target genes which are responsible for the progression through the G(1) phase (PubMed:18827403, PubMed:8114739). Hypophosphorylates RB1 in early G(1) phase (PubMed:18827403, PubMed:8114739). Cyclin D-CDK4 complexes are major integrators of various mitogenenic and antimitogenic signals (PubMed:18827403, PubMed:8114739).
