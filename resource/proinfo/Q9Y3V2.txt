UniprotID	Q9Y3V2
Accession	Q9Y3V2;A6NP44;A8K9F0;C9J9L7;C9JI45;Q08AJ7;Q6FID3;Q9BX35
EntryName	RWDD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	RWD domain-containing protein 3 (RWD domain-containing sumoylation enhancer) (RSUME)
GeneName	RWDD3 RSUME
Length	267
Function	Enhancer of SUMO conjugation. Via its interaction with UBE2I/UBC9, increases SUMO conjugation to proteins by promoting the binding of E1 and E2 enzymes, thioester linkage between SUMO and UBE2I/UBC9 and transfer of SUMO to specific target proteins which include HIF1A, PIAS, NFKBIA, NR3C1 and TOP1. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 positively regulate the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway by enhancing the sumoylation of NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA), promoting its stabilization which consequently leads to an increased inhibition of NF-kappa-B transcriptional activity. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 negatively regulate the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1A) signaling pathway by increasing the sumoylation of HIF1A, promoting its stabilization, transcriptional activity and the expression of its target gene VEGFA during hypoxia. Isoform 2 promotes the sumoylation and transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 and enhances the interaction of SUMO1 and NR3C1 with UBE2I/UBC9. Has no effect on ubiquitination.
