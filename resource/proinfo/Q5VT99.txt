UniprotID	Q5VT99
Accession	Q5VT99;Q96B32
EntryName	LRC38_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 38 (BK channel auxiliary gamma subunit LRRC38)
GeneName	LRRC38
Length	294
Function	Auxiliary protein of the large-conductance, voltage and calcium-activated potassium channel (BK alpha). Modulates gating properties by producing a marked shift in the BK channel's voltage dependence of activation in the hyperpolarizing direction, and in the absence of calcium.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
