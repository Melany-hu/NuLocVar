UniprotID	P22001
Accession	P22001;B2RA23;Q5VWN2;Q6P2D3
EntryName	KCNA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 3 (HGK5) (HLK3) (HPCN3) (Voltage-gated K(+) channel HuKIII) (Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv1.3)
GeneName	KCNA3 HGK5
Length	575
Function	Mediates the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable membranes. Assuming opened or closed conformations in response to the voltage difference across the membrane, the protein forms a potassium-selective channel through which potassium ions may pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region
