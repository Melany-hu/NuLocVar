UniprotID	Q9BZL1
Accession	Q9BZL1;Q2NL89
EntryName	UBL5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-like protein 5
GeneName	UBL5
Length	73
Function	Ubiquitin-like protein that plays a role in cell proliferation and sister chromatid cohesion by associating with spliceosomal proteins (PubMed:25092792). Participates thereby in pre-mRNA splicing by maintaining spliceosome integrity. Promotes the functional integrity of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway by interacting with FANCI component and subsequently mediating the formation of FANCI homodimers (PubMed:25862789). Also plays a protective role against ER stress-induced apoptosis (PubMed:37315790).
