UniprotID	Q8NDD1
Accession	Q8NDD1;Q5TBI0;Q5TBI1;Q6P6B4;Q7Z6H5;Q8N432;Q96NM6
EntryName	FSAF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	40S small subunit processome assembly factor 1
GeneName	FSAF1 C1orf131 cPERP-A
Length	293
Function	Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome. Prevents helicase DHX37 to be recruited before post-A1 state.
Subcellular Location	Chromosome; Nucleus; Nucleolus
