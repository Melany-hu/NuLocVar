UniprotID	O00635
Accession	O00635;B2R862
EntryName	TRI38_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM38 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 15) (Tripartite motif-containing protein 38) (Zinc finger protein RoRet)
GeneName	TRIM38 RNF15 RORET
Length	465
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein and E3 SUMO-protein ligase that acts as a regulator of innate immunity (PubMed:23056470). Acts as a negative regulator of type I interferon IFN-beta production by catalyzing 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination of AZI2/NAP1, leading to its degradation (By similarity). Mediates 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the critical TLR adapter TICAM1, inhibiting TLR3-mediated type I interferon signaling (PubMed:23056470). Acts as positive regulator of the cGAS-STING pathway by acting as a E3 SUMO-protein ligase: mediates sumoylation of CGAS and STING, preventing their degradation and thereby activating the innate immune response to DNA virus (By similarity). Also acts as a negative regulator of NF-kappa-B signaling independently of its E3 protein ligase activity by promoting lysosome-dependent degradation of TAB2 and TAB3 adapters (PubMed:24434549).
