UniprotID	O75688
Accession	O75688;Q461Q2;Q4J6C1;Q4J6C2;Q658R4;Q96ER6;Q9HAY8
EntryName	PPM1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein phosphatase 1B (EC 3.1.3.16) (Protein phosphatase 2C isoform beta) (PP2C-beta)
GeneName	PPM1B PP2CB
Length	479
Function	Enzyme with a broad specificity. Dephosphorylates CDK2 and CDK6 in vitro. Dephosphorylates PRKAA1 and PRKAA2. Inhibits TBK1-mediated antiviral signaling by dephosphorylating it at 'Ser-172'. Plays an important role in the termination of TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappa-B activation through dephosphorylating and inactivating IKBKB/IKKB.
