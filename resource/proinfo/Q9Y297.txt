Function	Substrate recognition component of a SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:10066435, PubMed:10497169, PubMed:10644755, PubMed:10835356, PubMed:11158290, PubMed:11238952, PubMed:11359933, PubMed:11994270, PubMed:12791267, PubMed:12902344, PubMed:14603323, PubMed:14681206, PubMed:14988407, PubMed:15448698, PubMed:15917222, PubMed:16371461, PubMed:22017875, PubMed:22017876, PubMed:22017877, PubMed:22087322, PubMed:25503564, PubMed:25704143, PubMed:36608670, PubMed:9859996, PubMed:9990852). Recognizes and binds to phosphorylated target proteins (PubMed:10066435, PubMed:10497169, PubMed:10644755, PubMed:10835356, PubMed:11158290, PubMed:11238952, PubMed:11359933, PubMed:11994270, PubMed:12791267, PubMed:12902344, PubMed:14603323, PubMed:14681206, PubMed:14988407, PubMed:15448698, PubMed:15917222, PubMed:16371461, PubMed:22017875, PubMed:22017876, PubMed:22017877, PubMed:22087322, PubMed:25503564, PubMed:25704143, PubMed:36608670, PubMed:9859996, PubMed:9990852). SCF(BTRC) mediates the ubiquitination of CTNNB1 and participates in Wnt signaling (PubMed:12077367, PubMed:12820959). SCF(BTRC) mediates the ubiquitination of phosphorylated NFKB1, ATF4, CDC25A, DLG1, FBXO5, PER1, SMAD3, SMAD4, SNAI1 and probably NFKB2 (PubMed:10835356, PubMed:11238952, PubMed:14603323, PubMed:14681206). SCF(BTRC) mediates the ubiquitination of NFKBIA, NFKBIB and NFKBIE; the degradation frees the associated NFKB1 to translocate into the nucleus and to activate transcription (PubMed:10066435, PubMed:10497169, PubMed:10644755, PubMed:9859996). Ubiquitination of NFKBIA occurs at 'Lys-21' and 'Lys-22' (PubMed:10066435). The SCF(FBXW11) complex also regulates NF-kappa-B by mediating ubiquitination of phosphorylated NFKB1: specifically ubiquitinates the p105 form of NFKB1, leading to its degradation (PubMed:10835356, PubMed:11158290, PubMed:14673179). SCF(BTRC) mediates the ubiquitination of CEP68; this is required for centriole separation during mitosis (PubMed:25503564, PubMed:25704143). SCF(BTRC) mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of nuclear NFE2L1 (By similarity). Has an essential role in the control of the clock-dependent transcription via degradation of phosphorylated PER1 and PER2 (PubMed:15917222). May be involved in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation through a DBB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Required for activation of NFKB-mediated transcription by IL1B, MAP3K14, MAP3K1, IKBKB and TNF. Required for proteolytic processing of GLI3 (PubMed:16371461). Mediates ubiquitination of REST, thereby leading to its proteasomal degradation (PubMed:18354482, PubMed:21258371). SCF(BTRC) mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of KLF4; thereby negatively regulating cell pluripotency maintenance and embryogenesis (By similarity). SCF(BTRC) acts as a regulator of mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of phosphorylated DEPTOR, TFE3 and MITF (PubMed:22017875, PubMed:22017876, PubMed:22017877, PubMed:33110214, PubMed:36608670). SCF(BTRC) directs 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination of UBR2 in the T-cell receptor signaling pathway (PubMed:38225265).
