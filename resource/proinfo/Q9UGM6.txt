UniprotID	Q9UGM6
Accession	Q9UGM6;B1ALR1;B2R9D4;Q53FT4;Q5VUD2;Q86TQ0
EntryName	SYWM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tryptophan--tRNA ligase, mitochondrial (EC 6.1.1.2) ((Mt)TrpRS) (Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase) (TrpRS)
GeneName	WARS2
Length	360
Function	Catalyzes the attachment of tryptophan to tRNA(Trp) in a two-step reaction: tryptophan is first activated by ATP to form Trp-AMP and then transferred to the acceptor end of tRNA(Trp).
