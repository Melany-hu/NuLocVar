UniprotID	P12544
Accession	P12544;A4PHN1;Q6IB36
EntryName	GRAA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Granzyme A (EC 3.4.21.78) (CTL tryptase) (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte proteinase 1) (Fragmentin-1) (Granzyme-1) (Hanukkah factor) (H factor) (HF)
GeneName	GZMA CTLA3 HFSP
Length	262
Function	Abundant protease in the cytosolic granules of cytotoxic T-cells and NK-cells which activates caspase-independent pyroptosis when delivered into the target cell through the immunological synapse (PubMed:12819770, PubMed:32299851, PubMed:3257574, PubMed:3262682, PubMed:3263427). It cleaves after Lys or Arg (PubMed:12819770, PubMed:32299851). Once delivered into the target cell, acts by catalyzing cleavage of gasdermin-B (GSDMB), releasing the pore-forming moiety of GSDMB, thereby triggering pyroptosis and target cell death (PubMed:32299851, PubMed:34022140, PubMed:36157507, PubMed:36899106). Cleaves APEX1 after 'Lys-31' and destroys its oxidative repair activity (PubMed:12524539). Cleaves the nucleosome assembly protein SET after 'Lys-189', which disrupts its nucleosome assembly activity and allows the SET complex to translocate into the nucleus to nick and degrade the DNA (PubMed:11555662, PubMed:12628186, PubMed:16818237).
