UniprotID	Q6YBV0
Accession	Q6YBV0;Q86X30;Q8IVM5;Q8N8S6
EntryName	S36A4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neutral amino acid uniporter 4 (Solute carrier family 36 member 4)
GeneName	SLC36A4 PAT4
Length	504
Function	Uniporter that mediates the transport of neutral amino acids like L-tryptophan, proline and alanine (PubMed:21097500). The transport activity is sodium ions-independent, electroneutral and therefore functions via facilitated diffusion (PubMed:21097500).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane
