EntryName	SIAS_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acetylneuraminate-9-phosphate synthase (EC 2.5.1.57) (3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononate 9-phosphate synthase) (EC 2.5.1.132) (N-acetylneuraminic acid phosphate synthase) (NANS) (Sialic acid phosphate synthase) (Sialic acid synthase)
GeneName	NANS SAS
Length	359
Function	Catalyzes the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate (ManNAc-6-P) to synthesize N-acetylneuraminate-9-phosphate (Neu5Ac-9-P) (PubMed:10749855). Also catalyzes the condensation of PEP and D-mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P) to produce 3-deoxy-D-glycero-beta-D-galacto-non-2-ulopyranosonate 9-phosphate (KDN-9-P) (PubMed:10749855). Neu5Ac-9-P and KDN-9-P are the phosphorylated forms of sialic acids N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and deaminoneuraminic acid (KDN), respectively (PubMed:10749855). Required for brain and skeletal development (PubMed:27213289).
