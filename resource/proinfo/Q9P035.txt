EntryName	HACD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 3 (EC 4.2.1.134) (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 3) (HACD3) (Butyrate-induced protein 1) (B-ind1) (hB-ind1) (Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-like A domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	HACD3 BIND1 PTPLAD1
Length	362
Function	Catalyzes the third of the four reactions of the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle. This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process, allows the addition of two carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids/VLCFAs per cycle. This enzyme catalyzes the dehydration of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate into trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA, within each cycle of fatty acid elongation. Thereby, it participates in the production of VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators. May be involved in Rac1-signaling pathways leading to the modulation of gene expression. Promotes insulin receptor/INSR autophosphorylation and is involved in INSR internalization (PubMed:25687571).
