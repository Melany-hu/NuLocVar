UniprotID	Q9HB29
Accession	Q9HB29;A4FU63;Q13525;Q45H74;Q53TU8;Q587I8
EntryName	ILRL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-1 receptor-like 2 (EC 3.2.2.6) (IL-36 receptor) (IL-36R) (Interleukin-1 receptor-related protein 2) (IL-1Rrp2) (IL1R-rp2)
GeneName	IL1RL2 IL1RRP2
Length	575
Function	Receptor for interleukin-36 (IL36A, IL36B and IL36G). After binding to interleukin-36 associates with the coreceptor IL1RAP to form the interleukin-36 receptor complex which mediates interleukin-36-dependent activation of NF-kappa-B, MAPK and other pathways (By similarity). The IL-36 signaling system is thought to be present in epithelial barriers and to take part in local inflammatory response; it is similar to the IL-1 system. Seems to be involved in skin inflammatory response by induction of the IL-23/IL-17/IL-22 pathway.
