UniprotID	O15229
Accession	O15229;A2A2U8;A2A2U9;A2A2V0;Q5SY07;Q5SY08;Q5SY09
EntryName	KMO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (EC 1.14.13.9) (Kynurenine 3-hydroxylase)
GeneName	KMO
Length	486
Function	Catalyzes the hydroxylation of L-kynurenine (L-Kyn) to form 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine (L-3OHKyn) (PubMed:23575632, PubMed:26752518, PubMed:28604669, PubMed:29208702, PubMed:29429898). Required for synthesis of quinolinic acid, a neurotoxic NMDA receptor antagonist and potential endogenous inhibitor of NMDA receptor signaling in axonal targeting, synaptogenesis and apoptosis during brain development. Quinolinic acid may also affect NMDA receptor signaling in pancreatic beta cells, osteoblasts, myocardial cells, and the gastrointestinal tract (Probable).
