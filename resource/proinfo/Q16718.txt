UniprotID	Q16718
Accession	Q16718;B2RD98;Q5H9R2;Q6IRX7
EntryName	NDUA5_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 5 (Complex I subunit B13) (Complex I-13kD-B) (CI-13kD-B) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 13 kDa-B subunit)
GeneName	NDUFA5
Length	116
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
