UniprotID	Q15485
Accession	Q15485;A6NFG7;A8K478;Q6IS69;Q7M4P4;Q9UC57
EntryName	FCN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ficolin-2 (37 kDa elastin-binding protein) (Collagen/fibrinogen domain-containing protein 2) (EBP-37) (Ficolin-B) (Ficolin-beta) (Hucolin) (L-ficolin) (Serum lectin p35)
GeneName	FCN2 FCNL
Length	313
Function	May function in innate immunity through activation of the lectin complement pathway. Calcium-dependent and GlcNAc-binding lectin. Enhances phagocytosis of S.typhimurium by neutrophils, suggesting an opsonic effect via the collagen region.
