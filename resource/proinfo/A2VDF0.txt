UniprotID	A2VDF0
Accession	A2VDF0;A1L300;Q5VWY2;Q5VWY3;Q6ZPD2
EntryName	FUCM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fucose mutarotase (EC 5.1.3.29)
GeneName	FUOM C10orf125
Length	154
Function	Involved in the interconversion between alpha- and beta-L-fucoses. L-Fucose (6-deoxy-L-galactose) exists as alpha-L-fucose (29.5%) and beta-L-fucose (70.5%), the beta-form is metabolized through the salvage pathway. GDP-L-fucose formed either by the de novo or salvage pathways is transported into the endoplasmic reticulum, where it serves as a substrate for N- and O-glycosylations by fucosyltransferases. Fucosylated structures expressed on cell surfaces or secreted in biological fluids are believed to play a critical role in cell-cell adhesion and recognition processes.
