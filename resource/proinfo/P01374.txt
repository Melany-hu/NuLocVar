UniprotID	P01374
Accession	P01374;Q8N4C3;Q9UKS8
EntryName	TNFB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha) (TNF-beta) (Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 1)
GeneName	LTA TNFB TNFSF1
Length	205
Function	Cytokine that in its homotrimeric form binds to TNFRSF1A/TNFR1, TNFRSF1B/TNFBR and TNFRSF14/HVEM (PubMed:9462508). In its heterotrimeric form with LTB binds to TNFRSF3/LTBR (PubMed:24248355). Lymphotoxin is produced by lymphocytes and is cytotoxic for a wide range of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.
