EntryName	ACOT4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisomal succinyl-coenzyme A thioesterase (EC 3.1.2.3) (Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 4) (Acyl-CoA thioesterase 4) (EC 3.1.2.2) (PTE-2b) (Peroxisomal acyl coenzyme A thioester hydrolase Ib) (Peroxisomal long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase Ib) (PTE-Ib)
GeneName	ACOT4 PTE2B PTEIB
Length	421
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoASH), regulating their respective intracellular levels (PubMed:16940157). Functions as a peroxisomal succinyl-coenzyme A thioesterase that can also hydrolyze glutaryl-CoA and long chain saturated acyl-CoAs (PubMed:16940157).
