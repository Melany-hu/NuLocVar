UniprotID	Q13118
Accession	Q13118;A8MVH0;B2R794;L0R4P6;L0R679;O75411;Q503B2
EntryName	KLF10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Krueppel-like factor 10 (EGR-alpha) (Transforming growth factor-beta-inducible early growth response protein 1) (TGFB-inducible early growth response protein 1) (TIEG-1)
GeneName	KLF10 TIEG TIEG1
Length	480
Function	Transcriptional repressor which binds to the consensus sequence 5'-GGTGTG-3'. Plays a role in the regulation of the circadian clock; binds to the GC box sequence in the promoter of the core clock component ARTNL/BMAL1 and represses its transcriptional activity. Regulates the circadian expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and glycolysis in the liver. Represses the expression of PCK2, a rate-limiting step enzyme of gluconeogenesis (By similarity). May play a role in the cell cycle regulation.
