UniprotID	Q9H147
Accession	Q9H147;B2RA18;Q96DE3;Q9BQP2;Q9H148
EntryName	TDIF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deoxynucleotidyltransferase terminal-interacting protein 1 (Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-interacting factor 1) (TdIF1) (TdT-interacting factor 1)
GeneName	DNTTIP1 C20orf167 TDIF1
Length	329
Function	Increases DNTT terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase activity (in vitro) (PubMed:11473582). Also acts as a transcriptional regulator, binding to the consensus sequence 5'-GNTGCATG-3' following an AT-tract. Associates with RAB20 promoter and positively regulates its transcription. Binds DNA and nucleosomes; may recruit HDAC1 complexes to nucleosomes or naked DNA.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
