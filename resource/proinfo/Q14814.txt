UniprotID	Q14814
Accession	Q14814;D3DVC0;Q14815;Q5T9U5;Q5T9U6
EntryName	MEF2D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2D
GeneName	MEF2D
Length	521
Function	Transcriptional activator which binds specifically to the MEF2 element, 5'-YTA(4)TAR-3', found in numerous muscle-specific, growth factor- and stress-induced genes. Mediates cellular functions not only in skeletal and cardiac muscle development, but also in neuronal differentiation and survival. Plays diverse roles in the control of cell growth, survival and apoptosis via p38 MAPK signaling in muscle-specific and/or growth factor-related transcription. Plays a critical role in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis (By similarity).
