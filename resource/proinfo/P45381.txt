UniprotID	P45381
Accession	P45381
EntryName	ACY2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aspartoacylase (EC 3.5.1.15) (Aminoacylase-2) (ACY-2)
GeneName	ASPA ACY2 ASP
Length	313
Function	Catalyzes the deacetylation of N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) to produce acetate and L-aspartate. NAA occurs in high concentration in brain and its hydrolysis NAA plays a significant part in the maintenance of intact white matter. In other tissues it acts as a scavenger of NAA from body fluids.
