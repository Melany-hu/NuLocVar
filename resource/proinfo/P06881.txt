UniprotID	P06881
Accession	P06881;Q93048;Q9UCP0
EntryName	CALCA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcitonin gene-related peptide 1 (CGRP1) (Alpha-type CGRP) (Calcitonin gene-related peptide I) (CGRP-I)
GeneName	CALCA CALC1
Length	128
Function	CGRP1/CALCA is a peptide hormone that induces vasodilation mediated by the CALCRL-RAMP1 receptor complex (PubMed:1318039, PubMed:33602864, PubMed:9620797). Dilates a variety of vessels including the coronary, cerebral and systemic vasculature. Its abundance in the CNS also points toward a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator role (PubMed:3492492). It also elevates platelet cAMP (PubMed:1318039). CGRP1 can also bind and activate CALCR-RAMP1 (AMYR1) receptor complex (PubMed:38603770).
