EntryName	5HT5A_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 5A (5-HT-5) (5-HT-5A) (5-HT5A) (Serotonin receptor 5A)
GeneName	HTR5A
Length	357
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), a biogenic hormone that functions as a neurotransmitter, a hormone and a mitogen (PubMed:35610220, PubMed:35835867, PubMed:9865521). Also functions as a receptor for ergot alkaloid derivatives and other psychoactive substances (PubMed:35835867). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors (PubMed:35610220, PubMed:35835867, PubMed:9865521). HTR5A is coupled to G(i)/G(o) G alpha proteins and mediates inhibitory neurotransmission: signaling inhibits adenylate cyclase activity and activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system that regulates the release of Ca(2+) ions from intracellular stores (PubMed:35610220, PubMed:35835867, PubMed:9865521).
