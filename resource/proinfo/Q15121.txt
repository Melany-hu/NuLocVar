UniprotID	Q15121
Accession	Q15121;B1AKZ3;O00511
EntryName	PEA15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Astrocytic phosphoprotein PEA-15 (15 kDa phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes) (Phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes) (PED)
GeneName	PEA15
Length	130
Function	Blocks Ras-mediated inhibition of integrin activation and modulates the ERK MAP kinase cascade. Inhibits RPS6KA3 activities by retaining it in the cytoplasm (By similarity). Inhibits both TNFRSF6- and TNFRSF1A-mediated CASP8 activity and apoptosis. Regulates glucose transport by controlling both the content of SLC2A1 glucose transporters on the plasma membrane and the insulin-dependent trafficking of SLC2A4 from the cell interior to the surface.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
