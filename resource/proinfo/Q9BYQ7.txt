UniprotID	Q9BYQ7
Accession	Q9BYQ7;A8MWS7;Q3SYF2
EntryName	KRA41_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 4-1 (Keratin-associated protein 4-10) (Keratin-associated protein 4.1) (Keratin-associated protein 4.10) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 4.10)
GeneName	KRTAP4-1 KAP4.10 KRTAP4-10 KRTAP4.1 KRTAP4.10
Length	146
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
