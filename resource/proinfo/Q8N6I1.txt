UniprotID	Q8N6I1
Accession	Q8N6I1;A7YQ71;Q6X7T0;Q6ZR61
EntryName	EID2_HUMAN
ProteinName	EP300-interacting inhibitor of differentiation 2 (EID-2) (CREBBP/EP300 inhibitor 2) (EID-1-like inhibitor of differentiation 2)
GeneName	EID2 CRI2
Length	236
Function	Interacts with EP300 and acts as a repressor of MYOD-dependent transcription and muscle differentiation. Inhibits EP300 histone acetyltransferase activity. Acts as a repressor of TGFB/SMAD transcriptional responses. May act as a repressor of the TGFB/SMAD3-dependent signaling by selectively blocking formation of TGFB-induced SMAD3-SMAD4 complex.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
