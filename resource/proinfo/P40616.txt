UniprotID	P40616
Accession	P40616;B4DWW1;P80417;Q53XB1
EntryName	ARL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 1
GeneName	ARL1
Length	181
Function	GTP-binding protein that recruits several effectors, such as golgins, arfaptins and Arf-GEFs to the trans-Golgi network, and modulates their functions at the Golgi complex (PubMed:21239483, PubMed:22679020, PubMed:27373159, PubMed:27436755, PubMed:9624189). Plays thereby a role in a wide range of fundamental cellular processes, including cell polarity, innate immunity, or protein secretion mediated by arfaptins, which were shown to play a role in maintaining insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells (PubMed:22981988).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane; Membrane
