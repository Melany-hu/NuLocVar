UniprotID	P28065
Accession	P28065;B0V0T1;Q16523;Q5JNW4
EntryName	PSB9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteasome subunit beta type-9 (EC 3.4.25.1) (Low molecular mass protein 2) (Macropain chain 7) (Multicatalytic endopeptidase complex chain 7) (Proteasome chain 7) (Proteasome subunit beta-1i) (Really interesting new gene 12 protein)
GeneName	PSMB9 LMP2 PSMB6i RING12
Length	219
Function	The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex which is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or slightly basic pH (PubMed:33727065, PubMed:34819510). The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity. This subunit is involved in antigen processing to generate class I binding peptides. Replacement of PSMB6 by PSMB9 increases the capacity of the immunoproteasome to cleave model peptides after hydrophobic and basic residues.
