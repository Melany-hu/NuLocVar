UniprotID	P35548
Accession	P35548;D3DQN1;Q53XM4;Q9UD60
EntryName	MSX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein MSX-2 (Homeobox protein Hox-8)
GeneName	MSX2 HOX8
Length	267
Function	Acts as a transcriptional regulator in bone development. Represses the ALPL promoter activity and antagonizes the stimulatory effect of DLX5 on ALPL expression during osteoblast differentiation. Probable morphogenetic role. May play a role in limb-pattern formation. In osteoblasts, suppresses transcription driven by the osteocalcin FGF response element (OCFRE). Binds to the homeodomain-response element of the ALPL promoter.
