UniprotID	Q9NY59
Accession	Q9NY59;B7ZL82;Q2M1S8
EntryName	NSMA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 3 (EC 3.1.4.12) (Neutral sphingomyelinase 2) (nSMase-2) (nSMase2) (Neutral sphingomyelinase II)
GeneName	SMPD3
Length	655
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to form ceramide and phosphocholine. Ceramide mediates numerous cellular functions, such as apoptosis and growth arrest, and is capable of regulating these 2 cellular events independently. Also hydrolyzes sphingosylphosphocholine. Regulates the cell cycle by acting as a growth suppressor in confluent cells. Probably acts as a regulator of postnatal development and participates in bone and dentin mineralization (PubMed:10823942, PubMed:14741383, PubMed:15051724). Binds to anionic phospholipids (APLs) such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidic acid (PA) that modulate enzymatic activity and subcellular location. May be involved in IL-1-beta-induced JNK activation in hepatocytes (By similarity). May act as a mediator in transcriptional regulation of NOS2/iNOS via the NF-kappa-B activation under inflammatory conditions (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Cell membrane
