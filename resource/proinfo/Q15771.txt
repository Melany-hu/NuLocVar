UniprotID	Q15771
Accession	Q15771;Q6FGK1;Q6MZH2;Q96CI8
EntryName	RAB30_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-30
GeneName	RAB30
Length	203
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different set of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (By similarity). Required for maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus, possibly by mediating interactions with cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins.
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network; Cytoplasm; Golgi apparatus
