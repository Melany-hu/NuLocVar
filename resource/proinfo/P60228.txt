EntryName	EIF3E_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit E (eIF3e) (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 6) (Viral integration site protein INT-6 homolog) (eIF-3 p48)
GeneName	EIF3E EIF3S6 INT6
Length	445
Function	Component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is required for several steps in the initiation of protein synthesis (PubMed:17581632, PubMed:25849773, PubMed:27462815). The eIF-3 complex associates with the 40S ribosome and facilitates the recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A, eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation (PubMed:17581632). The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression (PubMed:25849773). Required for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD); may act in conjunction with UPF2 to divert mRNAs from translation to the NMD pathway (PubMed:17468741). May interact with MCM7 and EPAS1 and regulate the proteasome-mediated degradation of these proteins (PubMed:17310990, PubMed:17324924).
