UniprotID	Q92564
Accession	Q92564;B4DH25;Q7Z3F3;Q7Z6B8
EntryName	DCNL4_HUMAN
ProteinName	DCN1-like protein 4 (DCNL4) (DCUN1 domain-containing protein 4) (Defective in cullin neddylation protein 1-like protein 4)
GeneName	DCUN1D4 KIAA0276
Length	292
Function	Contributes to the neddylation of all cullins by transferring NEDD8 from N-terminally acetylated NEDD8-conjugating E2s enzyme to different cullin C-terminal domain-RBX complexes which are necessary for the activation of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs).
