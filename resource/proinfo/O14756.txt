UniprotID	O14756
Accession	O14756;O43275
EntryName	H17B6_HUMAN
ProteinName	17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 6 (17-beta-HSD 6) (17-beta-HSD6) (EC 1.1.1.105) (EC 1.1.1.209) (EC 1.1.1.239) (EC 1.1.1.53) (EC 1.1.1.62) (3-alpha->beta-hydroxysteroid epimerase) (3-alpha->beta-HSE) (Oxidative 3-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 6)
GeneName	HSD17B6 RODH SDR9C6
Length	317
Function	NAD-dependent oxidoreductase with broad substrate specificity that shows both oxidative and reductive activity (in vitro). Has 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity towards various steroids (in vitro). Converts 5-alpha-androstan-3-alpha,17-beta-diol to androsterone and estradiol to estrone (in vitro). Has 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity towards androsterone (in vitro). Has retinol dehydrogenase activity towards all-trans-retinol (in vitro). Can convert androsterone to epi-androsterone. Androsterone is first oxidized to 5-alpha-androstane-3,17-dione and then reduced to epi-andosterone. Can act on both C-19 and C-21 3-alpha-hydroxysteroids.
Subcellular Location	Microsome membrane; Early endosome membrane
