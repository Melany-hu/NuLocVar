UniprotID	Q86XA0
Accession	Q86XA0;H9ZYJ0;K7EK32
EntryName	MET23_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone-arginine methyltransferase METTL23 (EC 2.1.1.319) (Methyltransferase-like protein 23)
GeneName	METTL23 C17orf95
Length	190
Function	Histone methyltransferase that dimethylates histone H3 at 'Arg-17', forming asymmetric dimethylarginine (H3R17me2a), leading to activate transcription via chromatin remodeling (By similarity). Maternal factor involved in epigenetic chromatin reprogramming of the paternal genome in the zygote: mediates H3R17me2a, promoting histone H3.3 incorporation in the male pronucleus, leading to TET3 recruitment and subsequent DNA demethylation (By similarity).
