UniprotID	Q9H1E1
Accession	Q9H1E1;P80927;P83685;Q546N3
EntryName	RNAS7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease 7 (RNase 7) (EC 3.1.27.-) (Skin-derived antimicrobial protein 2) (SAP-2)
GeneName	RNASE7 UNQ2516/PRO6006
Length	156
Function	Exhibits a potent RNase activity (PubMed:12244054, PubMed:12527768, PubMed:17150966). Has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against many pathogenic microorganisms including uropathogenic E.coli (UPEC), and remarkably potent activity (lethal dose of 90% < 30 nM) against a vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (PubMed:12244054, PubMed:12527768, PubMed:17150966, PubMed:25075772, PubMed:33818125). Causes loss of bacterial membrane integrity (PubMed:17150966). Probably contributes to urinary tract sterility (PubMed:25075772). Bactericidal activity is independent of RNase activity (PubMed:17150966).
