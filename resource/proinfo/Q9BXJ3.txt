UniprotID	Q9BXJ3
Accession	Q9BXJ3;Q8IV25
EntryName	C1QT4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 4 (C1q/TNF-related protein 4)
GeneName	C1QTNF4 CTRP4
Length	329
Function	May be involved in the regulation of the inflammatory network. Its role as pro- or anti-inflammatory seems to be context dependent (PubMed:21658842, PubMed:27086950). Seems to have some role in regulating food intake and energy balance when administered in the brain. This effect is sustained over a two-day period, and it is accompanied by decreased expression of orexigenic neuropeptides in the hypothalamus 3 hours post-injection (By similarity).
