UniprotID	Q5T9C2
Accession	Q5T9C2;A2A329;Q8TEL4
EntryName	EEIG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Early estrogen-induced gene 1 protein (EEIG1)
GeneName	EEIG1 C9orf132 FAM102A
Length	384
Function	Key component of TNFSF11/RANKL- and TNF-induced osteoclastogenesis pathways, thereby mediates bone resorption in pathological bone loss conditions (By similarity). Required for TNFSF11/RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis via its interaction with TNFRSF11A/RANK, thereby facilitates the downsteam transcription of NFATC1 and activation of PLCG2 (By similarity). Facilitates recruitment of the transcriptional repressor PRDM1/BLIMP1 to the promoter of the anti-osteoclastogenesis gene IRF8, thereby resulting in transcription of osteoclast differentiation factors (By similarity). May play a role in estrogen action (PubMed:14605097).
