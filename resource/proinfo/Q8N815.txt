UniprotID	Q8N815
Accession	Q8N815;Q658Q6;Q8NEP1
EntryName	CNTD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin N-terminal domain-containing protein 1
GeneName	CNTD1 CNTD
Length	330
Function	Plays a role in the different steps of crossover formation during meiotic recombination. Participates in the crossover differentiation step of crossover-specific recombination intermediates through its interaction with PRR19. In addition, stimulates crossover formation through the interactions with RFC3 and RFC4 and simultaneously regulates cell-cycle progression through interactions with CDC34 and subsequent ubiquitination of WEE1. May also participates in an active deselection process that destabilizes or removes excess pre-CO intermediates.
