EntryName	GNAI3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit alpha-3 (G(i) alpha-3)
GeneName	GNAI3
Length	354
Function	Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in numerous signaling cascades. The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state. Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding. The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal. Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numerous regulatory proteins (PubMed:18434541, PubMed:19478087, PubMed:8774883). Signaling is mediated via effector proteins, such as adenylate cyclase. Inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, leading to decreased intracellular cAMP levels (PubMed:19478087). Stimulates the activity of receptor-regulated K(+) channels (PubMed:2535845). The active GTP-bound form prevents the association of RGS14 with centrosomes and is required for the translocation of RGS14 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. May play a role in cell division (PubMed:17635935).
