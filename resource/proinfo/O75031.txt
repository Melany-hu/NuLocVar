Length	334
Function	Meiotic recombination factor component of recombination bridges involved in meiotic double-strand break repair. Modulates the localization of recombinases DMC1:RAD51 to meiotic double-strand break (DSB) sites through the interaction with BRCA2 and its recruitment during meiotic recombination (By similarity) (PubMed:31242413). Indispensable for the DSB repair, homologous synapsis, and crossover formation that are needed for progression past metaphase I, is essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility (By similarity). Required for proper recombinase recruitment in female meiosis (By similarity). Inhibits BNC1 transcriptional activity during spermatogenesis, probably by sequestering it in the cytoplasm (By similarity). May be involved in modulating HSF2 activation in testis (PubMed:9651507).
