EntryName	CEP44_HUMAN
ProteinName	Centrosomal protein of 44 kDa (Cep44) (HBV PreS1-transactivated protein 3) (PS1TP3)
GeneName	CEP44 KIAA1712
Length	390
Function	Centriole-enriched microtubule-binding protein involved in centriole biogenesis. In collaboration with CEP295 and POC1B, is required for the centriole-to-centrosome conversion by ensuring the formation of bona fide centriole wall (PubMed:32060285). Functions as a linker component that maintains centrosome cohesion. Associates with CROCC and regulates its stability and localization to the centrosome (PubMed:31974111).
