EntryName	CCM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cerebral cavernous malformations 2 protein (Malcavernin)
GeneName	CCM2 C7orf22 PP10187
Length	444
Function	Component of the CCM signaling pathway which is a crucial regulator of heart and vessel formation and integrity. May act through the stabilization of endothelial cell junctions (By similarity). May function as a scaffold protein for MAP2K3-MAP3K3 signaling. Seems to play a major role in the modulation of MAP3K3-dependent p38 activation induced by hyperosmotic shock (By similarity).
