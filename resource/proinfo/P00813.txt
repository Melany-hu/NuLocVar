UniprotID	P00813
Accession	P00813;Q53F92;Q6LA59
EntryName	ADA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4) (Adenosine aminohydrolase)
GeneName	ADA ADA1
Length	363
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine and 2-deoxyadenosine (PubMed:16670267, PubMed:23193172, PubMed:26166670, PubMed:8452534, PubMed:9361033). Plays an important role in purine metabolism and in adenosine homeostasis. Modulates signaling by extracellular adenosine, and so contributes indirectly to cellular signaling events. Acts as a positive regulator of T-cell coactivation, by binding DPP4 (PubMed:20959412). Its interaction with DPP4 regulates lymphocyte-epithelial cell adhesion (PubMed:11772392). Enhances dendritic cell immunogenicity by affecting dendritic cell costimulatory molecule expression and cytokines and chemokines secretion (By similarity). Enhances CD4+ T-cell differentiation and proliferation (PubMed:20959412). Acts as a positive modulator of adenosine receptors ADORA1 and ADORA2A, by enhancing their ligand affinity via conformational change (PubMed:23193172). Stimulates plasminogen activation (PubMed:15016824). Plays a role in male fertility (PubMed:21919946, PubMed:26166670). Plays a protective role in early postimplantation embryonic development (By similarity). Also responsible for the deamination of cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine), a fungal natural product that shows antitumor, antibacterial, antifungal, antivirus, and immune regulation properties (PubMed:26038697).
