UniprotID	Q9Y5Y7
Accession	Q9Y5Y7;Q8TC18;Q9UNF4
EntryName	LYVE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor 1 (LYVE-1) (Cell surface retention sequence-binding protein 1) (CRSBP-1) (Extracellular link domain-containing protein 1) (Hyaluronic acid receptor)
GeneName	LYVE1 CRSBP1 HAR XLKD1 UNQ230/PRO263
Length	322
Function	Ligand-specific transporter trafficking between intracellular organelles (TGN) and the plasma membrane. Plays a role in autocrine regulation of cell growth mediated by growth regulators containing cell surface retention sequence binding (CRS). May act as a hyaluronan (HA) transporter, either mediating its uptake for catabolism within lymphatic endothelial cells themselves, or its transport into the lumen of afferent lymphatic vessels for subsequent re-uptake and degradation in lymph nodes (PubMed:10037799). Binds to pericelluar hyaluronan matrices deposited on the surface of leukocytes and facilitates cell adhesion and migration through lymphatic endothelium (PubMed:26823460).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
