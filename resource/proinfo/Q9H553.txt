ProteinName	Alpha-1,3/1,6-mannosyltransferase ALG2 (EC 2.4.1.132) (EC 2.4.1.257) (Asparagine-linked glycosylation protein 2 homolog) (GDP-Man:Man(1)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase) (GDP-Man:Man(1)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol mannosyltransferase) (GDP-Man:Man(2)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase)
GeneName	ALG2 UNQ666/PRO1298
Length	416
Function	Mannosyltransferase that operates in the biosynthetic pathway of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, the glycan precursors employed in protein asparagine (N)-glycosylation. The assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides begins on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and finishes in its lumen. The sequential addition of sugars to dolichol pyrophosphate produces dolichol-linked oligosaccharides containing fourteen sugars, including two GlcNAcs, nine mannoses and three glucoses. Once assembled, the oligosaccharide is transferred from the lipid to nascent proteins by oligosaccharyltransferases. Catalyzes, on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, the addition of the second and third mannose residues to the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide chain, to produce Man3GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol core oligosaccharide. Man3GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol is a substrate for ALG11, the following enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway (PubMed:12684507, PubMed:35136180). While both alpha 1,3 and alpha 1,6 linkages are possible, the sequential addition of alpha 1,3 followed by alpha 1,6 is probably the preferred route (PubMed:35136180).
