UniprotID	Q15599
Accession	Q15599;D3DU84;D3DU85;H3BSV6;O00272;O00556;Q3KQY7
EntryName	NHRF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Na(+)/H(+) exchange regulatory cofactor NHE-RF2 (NHERF-2) (NHE3 kinase A regulatory protein E3KARP) (SRY-interacting protein 1) (SIP-1) (Sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor 2) (Solute carrier family 9 isoform A3 regulatory factor 2) (Tyrosine kinase activator protein 1) (TKA-1)
GeneName	NHERF2 SLC9A3R2
Length	337
Function	Scaffold protein that connects plasma membrane proteins with members of the ezrin/moesin/radixin family and thereby helps to link them to the actin cytoskeleton and to regulate their surface expression. Necessary for cAMP-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of SLC9A3 (PubMed:18829453). May also act as scaffold protein in the nucleus.
Subcellular Location	Endomembrane system; Nucleus; Apical cell membrane
