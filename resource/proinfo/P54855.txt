UniprotID	P54855
Accession	P54855;A6NDX0;A6NNJ4;A8K054;P23765;Q9UK63
EntryName	UDB15_HUMAN
ProteinName	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 (UDPGT 2B15) (UGT2B15) (EC 2.4.1.17) (HLUG4) (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B8) (UDPGT 2B8) (UDPGTh-3)
GeneName	UGT2B15 UGT2B8
Length	530
Function	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) that catalyzes phase II biotransformation reactions in which lipophilic substrates are conjugated with glucuronic acid to increase the metabolite's water solubility, thereby facilitating excretion into either the urine or bile (PubMed:16595710, PubMed:18719240, PubMed:23288867, PubMed:7835232, PubMed:9295060). Essential for the elimination and detoxification of drugs, xenobiotics and endogenous compounds (PubMed:7835232). Catalyzes the glucuronidation of endogenous steroid hormones such as androgens (testosterone, androsterone) and estrogens (estradiol, epiestradiol, estriol, catechol estrogens) (PubMed:16595710, PubMed:18719240, PubMed:23288867, PubMed:7835232, PubMed:9295060). Displays glucuronidation activity toward several classes of xenobiotic substrates, including phenolic compounds (eugenol, 4-nitrophenol, 4-hydroxybiphenyl) and phenylpropanoids (naringenin, coumarins) (PubMed:7835232). Catalyzes the glucuronidation of monoterpenoid alcohols such as borneol, menthol and isomenthol, a class of natural compounds used in essential oils (By similarity).
