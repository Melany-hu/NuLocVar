UniprotID	P11233
Accession	P11233;A4D1W3
EntryName	RALA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Ral-A (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RALA RAL
Length	206
Function	Multifunctional GTPase involved in a variety of cellular processes including gene expression, cell migration, cell proliferation, oncogenic transformation and membrane trafficking. Accomplishes its multiple functions by interacting with distinct downstream effectors (PubMed:18756269, PubMed:19306925, PubMed:20005108, PubMed:21822277, PubMed:30500825). Acts as a GTP sensor for GTP-dependent exocytosis of dense core vesicles. The RALA-exocyst complex regulates integrin-dependent membrane raft exocytosis and growth signaling (PubMed:20005108). Key regulator of LPAR1 signaling and competes with GRK2 for binding to LPAR1 thus affecting the signaling properties of the receptor. Required for anchorage-independent proliferation of transformed cells (PubMed:19306925). During mitosis, supports the stabilization and elongation of the intracellular bridge between dividing cells. Cooperates with EXOC2 to recruit other components of the exocyst to the early midbody (PubMed:18756269). During mitosis, also controls mitochondrial fission by recruiting to the mitochondrion RALBP1, which mediates the phosphorylation and activation of DNM1L by the mitotic kinase cyclin B-CDK1 (PubMed:21822277).
