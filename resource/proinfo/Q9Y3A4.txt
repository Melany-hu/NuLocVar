EntryName	RRP7A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosomal RNA-processing protein 7 homolog A (Gastric cancer antigen Zg14)
GeneName	RRP7A CGI-96
Length	280
Function	Nucleolar protein that is involved in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing (PubMed:33199730). Also plays a role in primary cilia resorption, and cell cycle progression in neurogenesis and neocortex development (PubMed:33199730). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
