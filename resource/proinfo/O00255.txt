GeneName	MEN1 SCG2
Length	610
Function	Essential component of a MLL/SET1 histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex, a complex that specifically methylates 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (H3K4). Functions as a transcriptional regulator. Binds to the TERT promoter and represses telomerase expression. Plays a role in TGFB1-mediated inhibition of cell-proliferation, possibly regulating SMAD3 transcriptional activity. Represses JUND-mediated transcriptional activation on AP1 sites, as well as that mediated by NFKB subunit RELA. Positively regulates HOXC8 and HOXC6 gene expression. May be involved in normal hematopoiesis through the activation of HOXA9 expression (By similarity). May be involved in DNA repair.
