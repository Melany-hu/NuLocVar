UniprotID	P41968
Accession	P41968;Q4KN27;Q9H517
EntryName	MC3R_HUMAN
ProteinName	Melanocortin receptor 3 (MC3-R)
GeneName	MC3R
Length	323
Function	Receptor for MSH (alpha, beta and gamma) and ACTH. This receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylate cyclase. Required for expression of anticipatory patterns of activity and wakefulness during periods of limited nutrient availability and for the normal regulation of circadian clock activity in the brain.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
