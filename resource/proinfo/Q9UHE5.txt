EntryName	NAT8_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acetyltransferase 8 (EC 2.3.1.-) (Acetyltransferase 2) (ATase2) (Camello-like protein 1) (Cysteinyl-conjugate N-acetyltransferase) (CCNAT) (EC 2.3.1.80)
GeneName	NAT8 CML1 GLA TSC501
Length	227
Function	Acetylates the free alpha-amino group of cysteine S-conjugates to form mercapturic acids (PubMed:20392701). This is the final step in a major route for detoxification of a wide variety of reactive electrophiles which starts with their incorporation into glutathione S-conjugates. The glutathione S-conjugates are then further processed into cysteine S-conjugates and finally mercapturic acids which are water soluble and can be readily excreted in urine or bile. Alternatively, may have a lysine N-acetyltransferase activity catalyzing peptidyl-lysine N6-acetylation of various proteins. Thereby, may regulate apoptosis through the acetylation and the regulation of the expression of PROM1 (PubMed:24556617). May also regulate amyloid beta-peptide secretion through acetylation of BACE1 and the regulation of its expression in neurons (PubMed:19011241).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
