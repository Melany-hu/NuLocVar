UniprotID	O60675
Accession	O60675;A4D214
EntryName	MAFK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor MafK (Erythroid transcription factor NF-E2 p18 subunit)
GeneName	MAFK
Length	156
Function	Since they lack a putative transactivation domain, the small Mafs behave as transcriptional repressors when they dimerize among themselves (PubMed:9150357). However, they act as transcriptional activators by dimerizing with other (usually larger) basic-zipper proteins, such as NFE2, NFE2L1/NRF1, NFE2L2/NRF2 and NFE2L3/NRF3, and recruiting them to specific DNA-binding sites (PubMed:8932385, PubMed:9150357). Small Maf proteins heterodimerize with Fos and may act as competitive repressors of the NF-E2 transcription factor (PubMed:9150357).
