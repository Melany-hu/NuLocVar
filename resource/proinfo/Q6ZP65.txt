Accession	Q6ZP65;A8MUC8;B4DWL0;B5MDJ0;O95000
EntryName	BICL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	BICD family-like cargo adapter 1 (Bicaudal D-related protein 1) (BICD-related protein 1) (BICDR-1) (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 64A) (CCDC64A)
GeneName	BICDL1 BICDR1 CCDC64
Length	573
Function	Acts as an adapter protein linking the dynein motor complex to various cargos and converts dynein from a non-processive to a highly processive motor in the presence of dynactin. Facilitates the interaction between dynein and dynactin and activates dynein processivity (the ability to move along a microtubule for a long distance without falling off the track). Predominantly recruits 2 dyneins, which increases both the force and speed of the microtubule motor. Component of secretory vesicle machinery in developing neurons that acts as a regulator of neurite outgrowth. Regulates the secretory vesicle transport by controlling the accumulation of Rab6-containing secretory vesicles in the pericentrosomal region restricting anterograde secretory transport during the early phase of neuronal differentiation, thereby inhibiting neuritogenesis.
