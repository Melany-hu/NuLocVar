UniprotID	Q86UD0
Accession	Q86UD0
EntryName	SAPC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Suppressor APC domain-containing protein 2 (Tumor specificity and mitosis phase-dependent expression protein) (TS/MDEP) (p42.3)
GeneName	SAPCD2 C9orf140
Length	394
Function	Plays a role in planar mitotic spindle orientation in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and promotes the production of symmetric terminal divisions (By similarity). Negatively regulates the mitotic apical cortex localization of GPSM2 (PubMed:26766442). Involved also in positive regulation of cell proliferation and tumor cell growth (PubMed:23576022, PubMed:23704824).
