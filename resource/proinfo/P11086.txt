UniprotID	P11086
Accession	P11086
EntryName	PNMT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMTase) (EC 2.1.1.28) (Noradrenaline N-methyltransferase)
GeneName	PNMT PENT
Length	282
Function	Catalyzes the transmethylation of nonepinephrine (noradrenaline) to form epinephrine (adrenaline), using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor (PubMed:20496117). Other substrates include phenylethanolamine and octopamine (PubMed:16277617, PubMed:16363801, PubMed:8812853). Also methylates normetanephrine (By similarity).
