UniprotID	Q15544
Accession	Q15544;B2R8R3;B4DY18;Q9UHS0
EntryName	TAF11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 11 (TFIID subunit p30-beta) (Transcription initiation factor TFIID 28 kDa subunit) (TAF(II)28) (TAFII-28) (TAFII28)
GeneName	TAF11 TAF2I PRO2134
Length	211
Function	The TFIID basal transcription factor complex plays a major role in the initiation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription (PubMed:33795473). TFIID recognizes and binds promoters with or without a TATA box via its subunit TBP, a TATA-box-binding protein, and promotes assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (PubMed:33795473). The TFIID complex consists of TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), including TAF1, TAF2, TAF3, TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF7, TAF8, TAF9, TAF10, TAF11, TAF12 and TAF13 (PubMed:33795473). TAF11, together with TAF13 and TBP, play key roles during promoter binding by the TFIID and TFIIA transcription factor complexes (PubMed:33795473).
