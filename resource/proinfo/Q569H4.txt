UniprotID	Q569H4
Accession	Q569H4;D3DSZ0;Q8IXY1;Q9NYI5
EntryName	LARGN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Largen (Mesenchymal stem cell protein DSC54) (Proline-rich protein 16)
GeneName	PRR16
Length	304
Function	Regulator of cell size that promotes cell size increase independently of mTOR and Hippo signaling pathways. Acts by stimulating the translation of specific mRNAs, including those encoding proteins affecting mitochondrial functions. Increases mitochondrial mass and respiration.
