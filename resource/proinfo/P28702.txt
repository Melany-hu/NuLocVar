UniprotID	P28702
Accession	P28702;P28703;Q59G65;Q5JP92;Q5STQ1
EntryName	RXRB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinoic acid receptor RXR-beta (Nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group B member 2) (Retinoid X receptor beta)
GeneName	RXRB NR2B2
Length	533
Function	Receptor for retinoic acid. Retinoic acid receptors bind as heterodimers to their target response elements in response to their ligands, all-trans or 9-cis retinoic acid, and regulate gene expression in various biological processes. The RAR/RXR heterodimers bind to the retinoic acid response elements (RARE).
