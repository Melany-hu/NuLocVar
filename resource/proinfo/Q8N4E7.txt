UniprotID	Q8N4E7
Accession	Q8N4E7
EntryName	FTMT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ferritin, mitochondrial (EC 1.16.3.1)
GeneName	FTMT
Length	242
Function	Catalyzes the oxidation of ferrous iron(II) to ferric iron(III) and stores iron in a soluble, non-toxic, readily available form (PubMed:11323407, PubMed:15201052). Important for iron homeostasis (PubMed:11323407, PubMed:15201052). Iron is taken up in the ferrous form and deposited as ferric hydroxides after oxidation (PubMed:11323407, PubMed:15201052).
