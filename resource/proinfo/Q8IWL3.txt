UniprotID	Q8IWL3
Accession	Q8IWL3;Q9BWS7
EntryName	HSC20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Iron-sulfur cluster co-chaperone protein HscB (DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 20) [Cleaved into: Iron-sulfur cluster co-chaperone protein HscB, cytoplasmic (C-HSC20); Iron-sulfur cluster co-chaperone protein HscB, mitochondrial]
GeneName	HSCB DNAJC20 HSC20
Length	235
Function	Acts as a co-chaperone in iron-sulfur cluster assembly in mitochondria (PubMed:20668094). Required for incorporation of iron-sulfur clusters into SDHB, the iron-sulfur protein subunit of succinate dehydrogenase that is involved in complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (PubMed:26749241). Recruited to SDHB by interaction with SDHAF1 which first binds SDHB and then recruits the iron-sulfur transfer complex formed by HSC20, HSPA9 and ISCU through direct binding to HSC20 (PubMed:26749241). Plays an essential role in hematopoiesis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Mitochondrion
