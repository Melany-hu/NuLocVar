UniprotID	Q13424
Accession	Q13424;A8K7H9;B4DX40;E1P5N1;Q16438
EntryName	SNTA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-1-syntrophin (59 kDa dystrophin-associated protein A1 acidic component 1) (Pro-TGF-alpha cytoplasmic domain-interacting protein 1) (TACIP1) (Syntrophin-1)
GeneName	SNTA1 SNT1
Length	505
Function	Adapter protein that binds to and probably organizes the subcellular localization of a variety of membrane proteins. May link various receptors to the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix via the dystrophin glycoprotein complex. Plays an important role in synapse formation and in the organization of UTRN and acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular synapse. Binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Sarcolemma; Cell junction; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
