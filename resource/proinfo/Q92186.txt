UniprotID	Q92186
Accession	Q92186;Q4VAZ0;Q92470;Q92746
EntryName	SIA8B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 8B (EC 2.4.3.-) (Sialyltransferase 8B) (SIAT8-B) (Sialyltransferase St8Sia II) (ST8SiaII) (Sialyltransferase X) (STX)
GeneName	ST8SIA2 SIAT8B STX
Length	375
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of a sialic acid from a CMP-linked sialic acid donor onto a terminal alpha-2,3-, alpha-2,6-, or alpha-2,8-linked sialic acid of an N-linked glycan acceptor through alpha-2,8-linkages (Probable) (PubMed:10766765, PubMed:11744634, PubMed:9054414, PubMed:9774483). Therefore, participates in polysialic acid synthesis on various sialylated N-acetyllactosaminyl oligosaccharides (alpha-2,3-, alpha-2,6-, or alpha-2,8-linked sialic acid), including NCAM1, NCAM1 N-glycans, FETUB N-glycans, and to a lesser extent sialylparagloboside (SPG) and AHSG, which does not require the initial addition of an alpha 2,8-sialic acid (Probable) (PubMed:7559389). However, does not exhibit sialic acid-polymerase activity (By similarity). Catalyzes polysialic acid synthesis in the hippocampal on NCAM1 and supports neurite outgrowth (PubMed:9054414). ST8SIA2-mediated polysialylation influences on oligodendrocyte differentiation and may promote the integrity of myelin and axons (By similarity).
