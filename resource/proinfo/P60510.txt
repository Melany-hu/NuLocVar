UniprotID	P60510
Accession	P60510;P33172
EntryName	PP4C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 4 catalytic subunit (PP4C) (Pp4) (EC 3.1.3.16) (Protein phosphatase X) (PP-X)
GeneName	PPP4C PPP4 PPX
Length	307
Function	Protein phosphatase that is involved in many processes such as microtubule organization at centrosomes, maturation of spliceosomal snRNPs, apoptosis, DNA repair, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha signaling, activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase MAPK8, regulation of histone acetylation, DNA damage checkpoint signaling, NF-kappa-B activation and cell migration. The PPP4C-PPP4R1 PP4 complex may play a role in dephosphorylation and regulation of HDAC3. The PPP4C-PPP4R2-PPP4R3A PP4 complex specifically dephosphorylates H2AX phosphorylated on Ser-140 (gamma-H2AX) generated during DNA replication and required for DNA double strand break repair. Dephosphorylates NDEL1 at CDK1 phosphorylation sites and negatively regulates CDK1 activity in interphase (By similarity). In response to DNA damage, catalyzes RPA2 dephosphorylation, an essential step for DNA repair since it allows the efficient RPA2-mediated recruitment of RAD51 to chromatin.
