EntryName	RGS7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 7 (RGS7)
GeneName	RGS7
Length	495
Function	GTPase activator component of the RGS7-GNB5 complex that regulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades (PubMed:10521509, PubMed:10862767, PubMed:31189666). The RGS7-GNB5 complex acts as an inhibitor signal transduction by promoting the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits, such as GNAO1, thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form (PubMed:10521509, PubMed:10862767). May play a role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Probable) (PubMed:12659861). Glycine-dependent regulation of the RGS7-GNB5 complex by GPR158 affects mood and cognition via its ability to regulate neuronal excitability in L2/L3 pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex (By similarity). Modulates the activity of potassium channels that are activated by GNAO1 in response to muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2/CHRM2 signaling (PubMed:15897264).
