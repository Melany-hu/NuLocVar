UniprotID	A4D1U4
Accession	A4D1U4;Q9ULS3
EntryName	DEN11_HUMAN
ProteinName	DENN domain-containing protein 11 (DENND11) (Protein LCHN)
GeneName	DENND11 KIAA1147 LCHN
Length	455
Function	Probable guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). May promote the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting inactive GDP-bound small GTPases into their active GTP-bound form (Probable). May play a role in neuritogenesis, as well as in neuronal recovery and/or restructuring in the hippocampus following transient cerebral ischemia (By similarity).
