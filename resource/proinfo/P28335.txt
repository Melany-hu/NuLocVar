UniprotID	P28335
Accession	P28335;B1AMW4;Q5VUF8;Q9NP28
EntryName	5HT2C_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C (5-HT-2C) (5-HT2C) (5-HTR2C) (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1C) (5-HT-1C) (5-HT1C) (Serotonin receptor 2C)
GeneName	HTR2C HTR1C
Length	458
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (PubMed:12970106, PubMed:18703043, PubMed:19057895, PubMed:29398112, PubMed:7895773). Also functions as a receptor for various drugs and psychoactive substances, including ergot alkaloid derivatives, 1-2,5,-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl-2-aminopropane (DOI) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (PubMed:19057895, PubMed:29398112). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors (PubMed:18703043, PubMed:29398112). HTR2C is coupled to G(q)/G(11) G alpha proteins and activates phospholipase C-beta, releasing diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) second messengers that modulate the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and promote the release of Ca(2+) ions from intracellular stores, respectively (PubMed:18703043, PubMed:29398112). Beta-arrestin family members inhibit signaling via G proteins and mediate activation of alternative signaling pathways (PubMed:29398112). Regulates neuronal activity via the activation of short transient receptor potential calcium channels in the brain, and thereby modulates the activation of pro-opiomelanocortin neurons and the release of CRH that then regulates the release of corticosterone (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of appetite and eating behavior, responses to anxiogenic stimuli and stress (By similarity). Plays a role in insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis (By similarity).
