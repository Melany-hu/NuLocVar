UniprotID	Q9H0H3
Accession	Q9H0H3;B2RDH2;B3KRT7
EntryName	KLH25_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kelch-like protein 25 (Ectoderm-neural cortex protein 2) (ENC-2)
GeneName	KLHL25 ENC2
Length	589
Function	Substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex involved in various processes, such as translation homeostasis and lipid synthesis (PubMed:22578813, PubMed:27664236, PubMed:34491895). The BCR(KLHL25) ubiquitin ligase complex acts by mediating ubiquitination of hypophosphorylated EIF4EBP1 (4E-BP1): ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of hypophosphorylated EIF4EBP1 (4E-BP1) probably serves as a homeostatic mechanism to maintain translation and prevent eIF4E inhibition when eIF4E levels are low (PubMed:22578813). The BCR(KLHL25) complex does not target EIF4EBP1 (4E-BP1) when it is hyperphosphorylated or associated with eIF4E (PubMed:22578813). The BCR(KLHL25) complex also acts as a regulator of lipid synthesis by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of ACLY, thereby inhibiting lipid synthesis (PubMed:27664236, PubMed:34491895). BCR(KLHL25)-mediated degradation of ACLY promotes fatty acid oxidation and is required for differentiation of inducible regulatory T (iTreg) cells (PubMed:34491895).
