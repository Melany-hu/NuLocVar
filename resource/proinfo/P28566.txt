EntryName	5HT1E_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1E (5-HT-1E) (5-HT1E) (S31) (Serotonin receptor 1E)
GeneName	HTR1E
Length	365
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (PubMed:14744596, PubMed:1513320, PubMed:1608964, PubMed:1733778, PubMed:21422162, PubMed:33762731). Also functions as a receptor for various alkaloids and psychoactive substances (PubMed:14744596, PubMed:1513320, PubMed:1608964, PubMed:1733778, PubMed:21422162, PubMed:33762731). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase (PubMed:14744596, PubMed:1513320, PubMed:1608964, PubMed:1733778, PubMed:21422162, PubMed:33762731). HTR1E is coupled to G(i)/G(o) G alpha proteins and mediates inhibitory neurotransmission by inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity (PubMed:33762731, PubMed:35610220).
