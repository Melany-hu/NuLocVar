Accession	Q86Y78;B3KWC0;Q4G121;Q53TR3;Q659B1
EntryName	LYPD6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ly6/PLAUR domain-containing protein 6
GeneName	LYPD6 UNQ3023/PRO9821
Length	171
Function	Acts as a modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) function in the brain (PubMed:27344019, PubMed:34631692). Inhibits nicotine-induced Ca(2+) influx through nAChRs (PubMed:27344019). In vitro, specifically inhibits alpha-3:beta-4 and alpha-7 nAChR currents in an allosteric manner (PubMed:34631692). Acts as a positive regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling (By similarity).
