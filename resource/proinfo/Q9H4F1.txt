UniprotID	Q9H4F1
Accession	Q9H4F1;Q5T9D0;Q9NWU6;Q9UKU1;Q9ULB9;Q9Y3G3;Q9Y3G4
EntryName	SIA7D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminyl-2,3-beta-galactosyl-1,3-N-acetyl-galactosaminide alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.3.7) (NeuAc-alpha-2,3-Gal-beta-1,3-GalNAc-alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase) (ST6GalNAc IV) (ST6GalNAcIV) (Sialyltransferase 3C) (SIAT3-C) (Sialyltransferase 7D) (SIAT7-D)
GeneName	ST6GALNAC4 SIAT3C SIAT7D
Length	302
Function	Transfers the sialyl group (N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminyl or NeuAc) from CMP-NeuAc to the GalNAc residue on the NeuAc-alpha-2,3-Gal-beta-1,3-GalNAc sequence of glycoproteins and glycolipids forming an alpha-2,6-linkage. Produces branched type disialyl structures by transfer of a sialyl group onto a GalNAc residue inside the backbone core chains. Prefers O-glycans to glycoproteins or glycolipids.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
