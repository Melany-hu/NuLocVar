ProteinName	Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 8 (Acyl-CoA thioesterase 8) (EC 3.1.2.1) (EC 3.1.2.11) (EC 3.1.2.2) (EC 3.1.2.3) (EC 3.1.2.5) (Choloyl-coenzyme A thioesterase) (EC 3.1.2.27) (HIV-Nef-associated acyl-CoA thioesterase) (Peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase 2) (PTE-2) (Peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme A thioester hydrolase 1) (PTE-1) (Peroxisomal long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase 1) (Thioesterase II) (hACTE-III) (hACTEIII) (hTE)
GeneName	ACOT8 ACTEIII PTE1
Length	319
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoASH), regulating their respective intracellular levels (PubMed:15194431, PubMed:9153233, PubMed:9299485). Displays no strong substrate specificity with respect to the carboxylic acid moiety of Acyl-CoAs (By similarity). Hydrolyzes medium length (C2 to C20) straight-chain, saturated and unsaturated acyl-CoAS but is inactive towards substrates with longer aliphatic chains (PubMed:9153233, PubMed:9299485). Moreover, it catalyzes the hydrolysis of CoA esters of bile acids, such as choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA and competes with bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) (By similarity). Is also able to hydrolyze CoA esters of dicarboxylic acids (By similarity). It is involved in the metabolic regulation of peroxisome proliferation (PubMed:15194431).
