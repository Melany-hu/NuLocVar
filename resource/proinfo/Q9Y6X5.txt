UniprotID	Q9Y6X5
Accession	Q9Y6X5;A8K5G1;Q7L2N1
EntryName	ENPP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bis(5'-adenosyl)-triphosphatase ENPP4 (EC 3.6.1.29) (AP3A hydrolase) (AP3Aase) (Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 4) (E-NPP 4) (NPP-4)
GeneName	ENPP4 KIAA0879 NPP4
Length	453
Function	Hydrolyzes extracellular Ap3A into AMP and ADP, and Ap4A into AMP and ATP. Ap3A and Ap4A are diadenosine polyphosphates thought to induce proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Acts as a procoagulant, mediating platelet aggregation at the site of nascent thrombus via release of ADP from Ap3A and activation of ADP receptors.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
