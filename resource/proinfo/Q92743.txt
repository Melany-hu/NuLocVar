UniprotID	Q92743
Accession	Q92743;D3DRE4;Q9UNS5
EntryName	HTRA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine protease HTRA1 (EC 3.4.21.-) (High-temperature requirement A serine peptidase 1) (L56) (Serine protease 11)
GeneName	HTRA1 HTRA PRSS11
Length	480
Function	Serine protease with a variety of targets, including extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin. HTRA1-generated fibronectin fragments further induce synovial cells to up-regulate MMP1 and MMP3 production. May also degrade proteoglycans, such as aggrecan, decorin and fibromodulin. Through cleavage of proteoglycans, may release soluble FGF-glycosaminoglycan complexes that promote the range and intensity of FGF signals in the extracellular space. Regulates the availability of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) by cleaving IGF-binding proteins. Inhibits signaling mediated by TGF-beta family members. This activity requires the integrity of the catalytic site, although it is unclear whether TGF-beta proteins are themselves degraded. By acting on TGF-beta signaling, may regulate many physiological processes, including retinal angiogenesis and neuronal survival and maturation during development. Intracellularly, degrades TSC2, leading to the activation of TSC2 downstream targets.
