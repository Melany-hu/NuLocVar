UniprotID	Q8N5Y8-2
Accession	Q8N5Y8;A0A024R5Y7;Q6PK64;Q9NX03
EntryName	PAR16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP16 (EC 2.4.2.-) (ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin-like 15) (Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 16) (PARP-16)
GeneName	PARP16 ARTD15 C15orf30
Length	207
Function	Intracellular mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase that plays a role in different processes, such as protein translation and unfolded protein response (UPR), through the mono-ADP-ribosylation of proteins involved in those processes (PubMed:22701565, PubMed:23103912, PubMed:25043379, PubMed:34314702). Acts as an inhibitor of protein translation by catalyzing mono-ADP-ribosylation of ribosomal subunits, such as RPL14 and RPS6, thereby inhibiting polysome assembly and mRNA loading (PubMed:34314702). Mono-ADP-ribosylation of ribosomal subunits is promoted by NMNAT2 (PubMed:34314702). Involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) by ADP-ribosylating and activating EIF2AK3 and ERN1, two important UPR effectors (PubMed:23103912). May also mediate mono-ADP-ribosylation of karyopherin KPNB1 a nuclear import factor (PubMed:22701565). May not modify proteins on arginine or cysteine residues compared to other mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (PubMed:22701565).
