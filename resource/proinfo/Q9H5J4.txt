UniprotID	Q9H5J4
Accession	Q9H5J4;Q4W5L0;Q8NCD1
EntryName	ELOV6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Very long chain fatty acid elongase 6 (EC 2.3.1.199) (3-keto acyl-CoA synthase ELOVL6) (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 6) (ELOVL FA elongase 6) (Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 6) (Fatty acid elongase 2) (hELO2) (Fatty acyl-CoA elongase) (Long-chain fatty-acyl elongase) (Very long chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 6) (Very long chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA synthase 6)
GeneName	ELOVL6 FACE LCE
Length	265
Function	Catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction of the four reactions that constitute the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle. This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process allows the addition of 2 carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) per cycle. Condensing enzyme that elongates fatty acids with 12, 14 and 16 carbons with higher activity toward C16:0 acyl-CoAs. Catalyzes the synthesis of unsaturated C16 long chain fatty acids and, to a lesser extent, C18:0 and those with low desaturation degree. May participate in the production of saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
