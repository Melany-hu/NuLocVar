UniprotID	P13284
Accession	P13284;Q76MF9;Q8NEI4;Q8WU77;Q9UL08
EntryName	GILT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (EC 1.8.-.-) (Gamma-interferon-inducible protein IP-30) (Legumaturain)
GeneName	IFI30 GILT IP30
Length	250
Function	Lysosomal thiol reductase that can reduce protein disulfide bonds. May facilitate the complete unfolding of proteins destined for lysosomal degradation. Plays an important role in antigen processing. Facilitates the generation of MHC class II-restricted epitodes from disulfide bond-containing antigen by the endocytic reduction of disulfide bonds (By similarity). Also facilitates MHC class I-restricted recognition of exogenous antigens containing disulfide bonds by CD8+ T-cells or crosspresentation (By similarity).
