EntryName	AADAT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kynurenine/alpha-aminoadipate aminotransferase, mitochondrial (KAT/AadAT) (2-aminoadipate aminotransferase) (2-aminoadipate transaminase) (EC 2.6.1.39) (Alpha-aminoadipate aminotransferase) (AadAT) (Glycine transaminase AADAT) (EC 2.6.1.4) (Kynurenine aminotransferase II) (Kynurenine--glyoxylate transaminase AADAT) (EC 2.6.1.63) (Kynurenine--oxoglutarate aminotransferase II) (Kynurenine--oxoglutarate transaminase 2) (EC 2.6.1.7) (Kynurenine--oxoglutarate transaminase II) (Methionine--glyoxylate transaminase AADAT) (EC 2.6.1.73)
GeneName	AADAT KAT2 KYAT2
Length	425
Function	Transaminase with broad substrate specificity. Has transaminase activity towards aminoadipate, kynurenine, methionine and glutamate. Shows activity also towards tryptophan, aspartate and hydroxykynurenine. Accepts a variety of oxo-acids as amino-group acceptors, with a preference for 2-oxoglutarate, 2-oxocaproic acid, phenylpyruvate and alpha-oxo-gamma-methiol butyric acid. Can also use glyoxylate as amino-group acceptor (in vitro).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
