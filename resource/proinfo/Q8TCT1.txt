UniprotID	Q8TCT1
Accession	Q8TCT1;E9PAM0;Q17RU6
EntryName	PHOP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.75)
GeneName	PHOSPHO1
Length	267
Function	Phosphatase that has a high activity toward phosphoethanolamine (PEA) and phosphocholine (PCho) (PubMed:15175005). Involved in the generation of inorganic phosphate for bone mineralization (By similarity). Acts in a non-redundant manner with PHOSPHO1 in skeletal mineralization: while PHOSPHO1 mediates the initiation of hydroxyapatite crystallization in the matrix vesicles (MVs), ALPL/TNAP catalyzes the spread of hydroxyapatite crystallization in the extracellular matrix (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Extracellular vesicle
