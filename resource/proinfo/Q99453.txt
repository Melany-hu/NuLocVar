UniprotID	Q99453
Accession	Q99453;Q6PJD9
EntryName	PHX2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Paired mesoderm homeobox protein 2B (Neuroblastoma Phox) (NBPhox) (PHOX2B homeodomain protein) (Paired-like homeobox 2B)
GeneName	PHOX2B PMX2B
Length	314
Function	Involved in the development of several major noradrenergic neuron populations, including the locus coeruleus. Transcription factor which could determine a neurotransmitter phenotype in vertebrates. Enhances second-messenger-mediated activation of the dopamine beta-hydrolase and c-fos promoters, and of several enhancers including cAMP-response element and serum-response element.
