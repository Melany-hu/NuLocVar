EntryName	FBLN5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibulin-5 (FIBL-5) (Developmental arteries and neural crest EGF-like protein) (Dance) (Urine p50 protein) (UP50)
GeneName	FBLN5 DANCE UNQ184/PRO210
Length	448
Function	Essential for elastic fiber formation, is involved in the assembly of continuous elastin (ELN) polymer and promotes the interaction of microfibrils and ELN (PubMed:18185537). Stabilizes and organizes elastic fibers in the skin, lung and vasculature (By similarity). Promotes adhesion of endothelial cells through interaction of integrins and the RGD motif. Vascular ligand for integrin receptors which may play a role in vascular development and remodeling (PubMed:10428823). May act as an adapter that mediates the interaction between FBN1 and ELN (PubMed:17255108).
