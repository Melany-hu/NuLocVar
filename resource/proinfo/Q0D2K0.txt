EntryName	NIPA4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Magnesium transporter NIPA4 (Ichthyin) (NIPA-like protein 4) (Non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region protein 4)
GeneName	NIPAL4 ICHN NIPA4
Length	404
Function	Acts as a Mg(2+) transporter. Can also transport other divalent cations such as Ba(2+), Sr(2+) and Fe(2+) but to a much less extent than Mg(2+) (By similarity). May be a receptor for ligands (trioxilins A3 and B3) from the hepoxilin pathway (PubMed:15317751).
