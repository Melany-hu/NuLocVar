EntryName	CCNA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-A2 (Cyclin-A) (Cyclin A)
GeneName	CCNA2 CCN1 CCNA
Length	432
Function	Cyclin which controls both the G1/S and the G2/M transition phases of the cell cycle. Functions through the formation of specific serine/threonine protein kinase holoenzyme complexes with the cyclin-dependent protein kinases CDK1 or CDK2. The cyclin subunit confers the substrate specificity of these complexes and differentially interacts with and activates CDK1 and CDK2 throughout the cell cycle.
