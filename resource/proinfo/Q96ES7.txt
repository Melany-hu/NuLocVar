UniprotID	Q96ES7
Accession	Q96ES7;Q96MF5
EntryName	SGF29_HUMAN
ProteinName	SAGA-associated factor 29 (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 101) (SAGA complex-associated factor 29)
GeneName	SGF29 CCDC101
Length	293
Function	Chromatin reader component of some histone acetyltransferase (HAT) SAGA-type complexes like the TFTC-HAT, ATAC or STAGA complexes (PubMed:19103755, PubMed:20850016, PubMed:21685874, PubMed:26421618, PubMed:26578293). SGF29 specifically recognizes and binds methylated 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (H3K4me), with a preference for trimethylated form (H3K4me3) (PubMed:20850016, PubMed:21685874, PubMed:26421618, PubMed:26578293). In the SAGA-type complexes, SGF29 is required to recruit complexes to H3K4me (PubMed:20850016). Involved in the response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by recruiting the SAGA complex to H3K4me, thereby promoting histone H3 acetylation and cell survival (PubMed:23894581). Also binds non-histone proteins that are methylated on Lys residues: specifically recognizes and binds CGAS monomethylated on 'Lys-506' (By similarity).
