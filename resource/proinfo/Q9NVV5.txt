EntryName	AIG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Androgen-induced gene 1 protein (AIG-1) (Fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids hydrolase AIG1) (FAHFA hydrolase AIG1) (EC 3.1.-.-)
GeneName	AIG1 CGI-103
Length	238
Function	Hydrolyzes bioactive fatty-acid esters of hydroxy-fatty acids (FAHFAs), but not other major classes of lipids (PubMed:27018888). Show a preference for FAHFAs with branching distal from the carboxylate head group of the lipids (PubMed:27018888).
