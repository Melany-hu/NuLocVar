UniprotID	O14950
Accession	O14950;D3DUH6;Q13182;Q7Z5Z4
EntryName	ML12B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myosin regulatory light chain 12B (MLC-2A) (MLC-2) (Myosin regulatory light chain 2-B, smooth muscle isoform) (Myosin regulatory light chain 20 kDa) (MLC20) (Myosin regulatory light chain MRLC2) (SHUJUN-1)
GeneName	MYL12B MRLC2 MYLC2B
Length	172
Function	Myosin regulatory subunit that plays an important role in regulation of both smooth muscle and nonmuscle cell contractile activity via its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation triggers actin polymerization in vascular smooth muscle. Implicated in cytokinesis, receptor capping, and cell locomotion.
