Accession	Q8TAM2;A6NFG2;B3KWA5;Q67B97;Q86SY0;Q86TV9;Q86U26;Q8NDH9;Q96DG8
EntryName	TTC8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tetratricopeptide repeat protein 8 (TPR repeat protein 8) (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 8 protein)
GeneName	TTC8 BBS8
Length	250
Function	The BBSome complex is thought to function as a coat complex required for sorting of specific membrane proteins to the primary cilia. The BBSome complex is required for ciliogenesis but is dispensable for centriolar satellite function. This ciliogenic function is mediated in part by the Rab8 GDP/GTP exchange factor, which localizes to the basal body and contacts the BBSome. Rab8(GTP) enters the primary cilium and promotes extension of the ciliary membrane. Firstly the BBSome associates with the ciliary membrane and binds to RAB3IP/Rabin8, the guanosyl exchange factor (GEF) for Rab8 and then the Rab8-GTP localizes to the cilium and promotes docking and fusion of carrier vesicles to the base of the ciliary membrane. The BBSome complex, together with the LTZL1, controls SMO ciliary trafficking and contributes to the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway regulation. Required for proper BBSome complex assembly and its ciliary localization.
