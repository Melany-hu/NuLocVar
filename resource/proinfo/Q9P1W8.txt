UniprotID	Q9P1W8
Accession	Q9P1W8;B1AKP6;Q5D051;Q5JV25;Q5MKL4;Q8WWA5;Q9NQK8
EntryName	SIRPG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal-regulatory protein gamma (SIRP-gamma) (CD172 antigen-like family member B) (Signal-regulatory protein beta-2) (SIRP-b2) (SIRP-beta-2) (CD antigen CD172g)
GeneName	SIRPG SIRPB2
Length	387
Function	Probable immunoglobulin-like cell surface receptor. On binding with CD47, mediates cell-cell adhesion. Engagement on T-cells by CD47 on antigen-presenting cells results in enhanced antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and costimulates T-cell activation.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
