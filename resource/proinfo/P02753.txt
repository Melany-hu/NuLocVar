UniprotID	P02753
Accession	P02753;D3DR38;O43478;O43479;Q5VY24;Q8WWA3;Q9P178
EntryName	RET4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinol-binding protein 4 (Plasma retinol-binding protein) (PRBP) (RBP) [Cleaved into: Plasma retinol-binding protein(1-182); Plasma retinol-binding protein(1-181); Plasma retinol-binding protein(1-179); Plasma retinol-binding protein(1-176)]
GeneName	RBP4 PRO2222
Length	201
Function	Retinol-binding protein that mediates retinol transport in blood plasma (PubMed:5541771). Delivers retinol from the liver stores to the peripheral tissues (Probable). Transfers the bound all-trans retinol to STRA6, that then facilitates retinol transport across the cell membrane (PubMed:22665496).
