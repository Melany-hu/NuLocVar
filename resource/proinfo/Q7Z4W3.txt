UniprotID	Q7Z4W3
Accession	Q7Z4W3
EntryName	KR193_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 19-3 (GTHRP) (Glycine/tyrosine-rich protein)
GeneName	KRTAP19-3 KAP19.3
Length	81
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
