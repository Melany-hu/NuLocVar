UniprotID	Q6VVB1
Accession	Q6VVB1;Q3SYB1;Q5VUK7;Q6IMH1
EntryName	NHLC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase NHLRC1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Malin) (NHL repeat-containing protein 1) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase NHLRC1)
GeneName	NHLRC1 EPM2B
Length	395
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Together with the phosphatase EPM2A/laforin, appears to be involved in the clearance of toxic polyglucosan and protein aggregates via multiple pathways. In complex with EPM2A/laforin and HSP70, suppresses the cellular toxicity of misfolded proteins by promoting their degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Ubiquitinates the glycogen-targeting protein phosphatase subunits PPP1R3C/PTG and PPP1R3D in a laforin-dependent manner and targets them for proteasome-dependent degradation, thus decreasing glycogen accumulation. Polyubiquitinates EPM2A/laforin and ubiquitinates AGL and targets them for proteasome-dependent degradation. Also promotes proteasome-independent protein degradation through the macroautophagy pathway.
