UniprotID	A8MUP2
Accession	A8MUP2;B7Z4C1
EntryName	CSKMT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Citrate synthase-lysine N-methyltransferase CSKMT, mitochondrial (CS-KMT) (EC 2.1.1.-) (Methyltransferase-like protein 12, mitochondrial)
GeneName	CSKMT METTL12
Length	240
Function	Protein-lysine methyltransferase that selectively trimethylates citrate synthase (CS) in mitochondria (PubMed:28391595, PubMed:28887308). Seems to conduct trimethylation in a highly distributive manner rather than in a processive manner, and thus introduces a single methyl group per binding event (PubMed:28887308).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
