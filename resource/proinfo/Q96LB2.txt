UniprotID	Q96LB2
Accession	Q96LB2;Q4V9L2;Q8TDD8;Q8TDD9
EntryName	MRGX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor member X1 (Sensory neuron-specific G-protein coupled receptor 3/4)
GeneName	MRGPRX1 MRGX1 SNSR3 SNSR4
Length	322
Function	Orphan receptor. Probably involved in the function of nociceptive neurons. May regulate nociceptor function and/or development, including the sensation or modulation of pain. Potently activated by enkephalins including BAM22 (bovine adrenal medulla peptide 22) and BAM (8-22) (PubMed:26582731). BAM22 is the most potent compound and evoked a large and dose-dependent release of intracellular calcium in stably transfected cells. G(alpha)q proteins are involved in the calcium-signaling pathway. Activated by the antimalarial drug, chloroquine. May mediate chloroquine-induced itch, in a histamine-independent manner.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
