UniprotID	Q9BTP7
Accession	Q9BTP7;B3KY46;Q8WUJ7;Q96FX6
EntryName	FAP24_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fanconi anemia core complex-associated protein 24 (Fanconi anemia-associated protein of 24 kDa)
GeneName	FAAP24 C19orf40
Length	215
Function	Plays a role in DNA repair through recruitment of the FA core complex to damaged DNA. Regulates FANCD2 monoubiquitination upon DNA damage. Induces chromosomal instability as well as hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, when repressed. Targets FANCM/FAAP24 complex to the DNA, preferentially to single strand DNA.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
