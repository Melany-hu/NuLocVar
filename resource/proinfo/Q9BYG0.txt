EntryName	B3GN5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lactosylceramide 1,3-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.206) (Lactotriaosylceramide synthase) (Lc(3)Cer synthase) (Lc3 synthase) (UDP-GlcNAc:beta-Gal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 5) (BGnT-5) (Beta-1,3-Gn-T5) (Beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 5) (Beta3Gn-T5)
GeneName	B3GNT5
Length	378
Function	Beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that plays a key role in the synthesis of lacto- or neolacto-series carbohydrate chains on glycolipids, notably by participating in biosynthesis of HNK-1 and Lewis X carbohydrate structures. Has strong activity toward lactosylceramide (LacCer) and neolactotetraosylceramide (nLc(4)Cer; paragloboside), resulting in the synthesis of Lc(3)Cer and neolactopentaosylceramide (nLc(5)Cer), respectively. Probably plays a central role in regulating neolacto-series glycolipid synthesis during embryonic development.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
