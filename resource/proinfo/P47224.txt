UniprotID	P47224
Accession	P47224;B2R4P4;Q92992
EntryName	MSS4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide exchange factor MSS4 (Rab-interacting factor)
GeneName	RABIF MSS4 RASGRF3
Length	123
Function	Guanine-nucleotide-releasing protein that acts on members of the SEC4/YPT1/RAB subfamily. Stimulates GDP release from both YPT1, RAB3A and RAB10, but is less active on these proteins than on the SEC4 protein (PubMed:31540829). Might play a general role in vesicular transport.
