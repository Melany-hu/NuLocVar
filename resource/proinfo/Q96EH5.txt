UniprotID	Q96EH5
Accession	Q96EH5;Q8IUD0
EntryName	RL39L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosomal protein eL39-like 2 (60S ribosomal protein L39-2) (60S ribosomal protein L39-like) (Large ribosomal subunit protein eL39-like)
GeneName	RPL39L RPL39L1
Length	51
Function	Male germ cell-specific component of the ribosome, which is required for the formation of sperm and male fertility. Replaces the RPL39 paralog in the ribosome of male germ cells. The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell. The male germ cell-specific ribosome displays a ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel of distinct size and charge states compared with the classical ribosome. It is responsible for regulating the biosynthesis and folding of a subset of male germ-cell-specific proteins that are essential for the formation of sperm.
