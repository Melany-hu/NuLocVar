UniprotID	P42126
Accession	P42126;A8K512;Q13290;Q7Z2L6;Q7Z2L7;Q9BUB8;Q9BW05;Q9UDG6
EntryName	ECI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Enoyl-CoA delta isomerase 1, mitochondrial (EC 5.3.3.8) (3,2-trans-enoyl-CoA isomerase) (Delta(3),Delta(2)-enoyl-CoA isomerase) (D3,D2-enoyl-CoA isomerase) (Dodecenoyl-CoA isomerase)
GeneName	ECI1 DCI
Length	302
Function	Key enzyme of fatty acid beta-oxidation (Probable). Able to isomerize both 3-cis (3Z) and 3-trans (3E) double bonds into the 2-trans (2E) form in a range of enoyl-CoA species, with a preference for (3Z)-enoyl-CoAs over (3E)-enoyl-CoAs (By similarity) (PubMed:7818490). The catalytic efficiency of this enzyme is not affected by the fatty acyl chain length (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
