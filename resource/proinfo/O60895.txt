UniprotID	O60895
Accession	O60895;A7L9S6;K7EMD3;Q8N1F2
EntryName	RAMP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Receptor activity-modifying protein 2 (Calcitonin-receptor-like receptor activity-modifying protein 2) (CRLR activity-modifying protein 2)
GeneName	RAMP2
Length	175
Function	Accessory protein that interacts with and modulates the function of G-protein coupled receptors including calcitonin gene-related peptide type 1 receptor (CALCRL) and calcitonin receptor (CALCR) (PubMed:9620797). Required for the transport of CALCRL to the plasma membrane (PubMed:9620797). Together with CALCRL, form a receptor complex for adrenomedullin/ADM (PubMed:22102369, PubMed:32296767, PubMed:9620797). Together with CALCR, act as a receptor complex for calcitonin/CT/CALC (PubMed:35324283). Together with CALCR, also act as a receptor complex for amylin/IAPP (PubMed:35324283).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
