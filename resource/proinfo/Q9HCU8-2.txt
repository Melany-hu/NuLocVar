Length	79
Function	As a component of the tetrameric DNA polymerase delta complex (Pol-delta4), plays a role in high fidelity genome replication and repair. Within this complex, increases the rate of DNA synthesis and decreases fidelity by regulating POLD1 polymerase and proofreading 3' to 5' exonuclease activity (PubMed:16510448, PubMed:19074196, PubMed:20334433). Pol-delta4 participates in Okazaki fragment processing, through both the short flap pathway, as well as a nick translation system (PubMed:24035200). Under conditions of DNA replication stress, required for the repair of broken replication forks through break-induced replication (BIR), a mechanism that may induce segmental genomic duplications of up to 200 kb (PubMed:24310611). Involved in Pol-delta4 translesion synthesis (TLS) of templates carrying O6-methylguanine or abasic sites (PubMed:19074196). Its degradation in response to DNA damage is required for the inhibition of fork progression and cell survival (PubMed:24022480).
