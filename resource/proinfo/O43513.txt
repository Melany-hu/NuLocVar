UniprotID	O43513
Accession	O43513
EntryName	MED7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 7 (hMED7) (Activator-recruited cofactor 34 kDa component) (ARC34) (Cofactor required for Sp1 transcriptional activation subunit 9) (CRSP complex subunit 9) (Mediator complex subunit 7) (RNA polymerase transcriptional regulation mediator subunit 7 homolog) (Transcriptional coactivator CRSP33)
GeneName	MED7 ARC34 CRSP9
Length	233
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
