UniprotID	P16333
Accession	P16333;B7Z751;D3DNE3
EntryName	NCK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	SH2/SH3 adapter protein NCK1 (Cytoplasmic protein NCK1) (NCK adapter protein 1) (Nck-1) (SH2/SH3 adapter protein NCK-alpha)
GeneName	NCK1 NCK
Length	377
Function	Adapter protein which associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated growth factor receptors, such as KDR and PDGFRB, or their cellular substrates. Maintains low levels of EIF2S1 phosphorylation by promoting its dephosphorylation by PP1. Plays a role in the DNA damage response, not in the detection of the damage by ATM/ATR, but for efficient activation of downstream effectors, such as that of CHEK2. Plays a role in ELK1-dependent transcriptional activation in response to activated Ras signaling. Modulates the activation of EIF2AK2/PKR by dsRNA. May play a role in cell adhesion and migration through interaction with ephrin receptors.
