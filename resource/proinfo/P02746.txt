UniprotID	P02746
Accession	P02746;Q5T959;Q96H17
EntryName	C1QB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complement C1q subcomponent subunit B
GeneName	C1QB
Length	253
Function	C1q associates with the proenzymes C1r and C1s to yield C1, the first component of the serum complement system. The collagen-like regions of C1q interact with the Ca(2+)-dependent C1r(2)C1s(2) proenzyme complex, and efficient activation of C1 takes place on interaction of the globular heads of C1q with the Fc regions of IgG or IgM antibody present in immune complexes.
