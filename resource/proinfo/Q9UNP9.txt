EntryName	PPIE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase E (PPIase E) (EC 5.2.1.8) (Cyclophilin E) (Cyclophilin-33) (Rotamase E)
GeneName	PPIE CYP33
Length	301
Function	Involved in pre-mRNA splicing as component of the spliceosome (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:28076346). Combines RNA-binding and PPIase activities (PubMed:18258190, PubMed:20460131, PubMed:20677832, PubMed:8977107). Binds mRNA and has a preference for single-stranded RNA molecules with poly-A and poly-U stretches, suggesting it binds to the poly(A)-region in the 3'-UTR of mRNA molecules (PubMed:18258190, PubMed:20460131, PubMed:8977107). Catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in proteins (PubMed:18258190, PubMed:20541251, PubMed:20677832, PubMed:8977107). Inhibits KMT2A activity; this requires proline isomerase activity (PubMed:20460131, PubMed:20541251, PubMed:20677832).
