UniprotID	O14548
Accession	O14548;Q9P118
EntryName	CO72L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7A2-like, mitochondrial (Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7A-related protein) (COX7a-related protein) (Cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIIa-related protein) (EB1) (Supercomplex assembly factor 1)
GeneName	COX7A2L COX7AR COX7RP SCAF1 SCAFI
Length	114
Function	Assembly factor that mediates the formation of some mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes (respirasomes), thereby promoting oxidative phosphorylation and energy metabolism (PubMed:27545886, PubMed:30428348, PubMed:33727070, PubMed:36198313). Acts as a molecular adapter that associates with both mitochondrial respiratory complexes III (CIII) and IV (CIV), promoting their association (PubMed:27545886, PubMed:36198313). Mediates the formation of various mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, such as MCIII(2)IV(2), composed of two CIII and two CIV, and the CS-respirasome (MCI(1)III(2)IV(2)), composed of one CI, two CIII and two CIV (PubMed:27545886, PubMed:30428348). Not involved in the formation of the canonical respirasome (MCI(1)III(2)IV(1)), composed of one CI, two CIII and one CIV (By similarity). The formation of different respirasomes is important for cell adaptation to oxygen conditions and prevent metabolic exhaustion: supercomplexes mediated by COX7A2L/SCAF1 are required to maintain oxidative phosphorylation upon low oxygen conditions and promote metabolic rewiring toward glycolysis (PubMed:36198313).
