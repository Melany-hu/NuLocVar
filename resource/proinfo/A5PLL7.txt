UniprotID	A5PLL7
Accession	A5PLL7
EntryName	PDES1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Plasmanylethanolamine desaturase 1 (EC 1.14.19.77) (Transmembrane protein 189)
GeneName	PEDS1 KUA PDES TMEM189
Length	270
Function	Plasmanylethanolamine desaturase involved in plasmalogen biogenesis in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (PubMed:31604315, PubMed:32209662, PubMed:33859415). Plasmalogens are glycerophospholipids with a hydrocarbon chain linked by a vinyl ether bond at the glycerol sn-1 position, and are involved in antioxidative and signaling mechanisms (PubMed:31604315).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
