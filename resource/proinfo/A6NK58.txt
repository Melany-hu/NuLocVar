UniprotID	A6NK58
Accession	A6NK58
EntryName	LIPT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Octanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]:protein N-octanoyltransferase LIPT2, mitochondrial (Lipoate-protein ligase B) (Lipoyl/octanoyl transferase) (Lipoyltransferase 2) (EC 2.3.1.181) (Octanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]-protein N-octanoyltransferase)
GeneName	LIPT2
Length	231
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of endogenously produced octanoic acid from octanoyl-acyl-carrier-protein (octanoyl-ACP) onto the lipoyl domains of lipoate-dependent enzymes such as the protein H of the glycine cleavage system (GCSH) (PubMed:28757203). Lipoyl-ACP can also act as a substrate although octanoyl-ACP is likely to be the physiological substrate (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
