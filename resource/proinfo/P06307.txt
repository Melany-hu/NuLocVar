UniprotID	P06307
Accession	P06307
EntryName	CCKN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cholecystokinin (CCK) [Cleaved into: Cholecystokinin-58 (CCK58); Cholecystokinin-58 desnonopeptide ((1-49)-CCK58); Cholecystokinin-39 (CCK39); Cholecystokinin-33 (CCK33); Cholecystokinin-25 (CCK25); Cholecystokinin-18 (CCK18); Cholecystokinin-12 (CCK12); Cholecystokinin-8 (CCK8); Cholecystokinin-7 (CCK7); Cholecystokinin-5 (CCK5)]
GeneName	CCK
Length	115
Function	This peptide hormone induces gall bladder contraction and the release of pancreatic enzymes in the gut. Its function in the brain is not clear. Binding to CCK-A receptors stimulates amylase release from the pancreas, binding to CCK-B receptors stimulates gastric acid secretion.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
