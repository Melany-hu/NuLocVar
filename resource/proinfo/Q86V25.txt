EntryName	VASH2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tubulinyl-Tyr carboxypeptidase 2 (EC 3.4.17.17) (Vasohibin-2) (Vasohibin-like protein)
GeneName	VASH2 VASHL
Length	355
Function	Tyrosine carboxypeptidase that removes the C-terminal tyrosine residue of alpha-tubulin, thereby regulating microtubule dynamics and function (PubMed:29146869). Critical for spindle function and accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis since microtubule detyronisation regulates mitotic spindle length and postioning (PubMed:31171830). Acts as an activator of angiogenesis: expressed in infiltrating mononuclear cells in the sprouting front to promote angiogenesis (PubMed:19204325). Plays a role in axon formation (PubMed:31235911).
