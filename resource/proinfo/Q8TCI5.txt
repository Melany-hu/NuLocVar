Accession	Q8TCI5;D9J0A2;D9J0A3;Q4G0K4;Q52LJ6;Q5T5D5;Q5T5D6;Q8N310
EntryName	CMAP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ciliary microtubule-associated protein 3 (Protein pitchfork)
GeneName	CIMAP3 C1orf88 PIFO
Length	191
Function	During primary cilia disassembly, involved in cilia disassembly. Required specifically to control cilia retraction as well as the liberation and duplication of the basal body/centrosome. May act by stimulating AURKA activity at the basal body in a cell cycle-dependent manner.
