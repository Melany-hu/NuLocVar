EntryName	ADM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein ADM2 (Intermedin) [Cleaved into: Adrenomedullin-2 (AM2) (Intermedin-long) (IMDL); Intermedin-short (IMDS)]
GeneName	ADM2 AM2
Length	148
Function	Intermedin/ADM2 is a peptide hormone that plays a role as physiological regulator of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular bioactivities mediated by the CALCRL-RAMPs receptor complexes (PubMed:14615490). Activates the cAMP-dependent pathway through interaction with CALCRL-RAMP3 receptor complex (PubMed:14615490).
