UniprotID	P0DPK5
Accession	P0DPK5
EntryName	H3Y2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H3.X (Histone H3.Y2)
GeneName	H3Y2
Length	147
Function	Primate-specific variant histone H3, which constitutes a core component of nucleosomes (PubMed:20819935). Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling (Probable).
