UniprotID	Q9Y6K0
Accession	Q9Y6K0;Q69YJ9;Q9P0Y8
EntryName	CEPT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Choline/ethanolaminephosphotransferase 1 (hCEPT1) (EC 2.7.8.1) (EC 2.7.8.2) (1-alkenyl-2-acylglycerol choline phosphotransferase) (EC 2.7.8.22)
GeneName	CEPT1 PRO1101
Length	416
Function	Catalyzes both phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis from CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine, respectively (PubMed:10191259, PubMed:10893425, PubMed:12216837, PubMed:37137909). Involved in protein-dependent process of phospholipid transport to distribute phosphatidyl choline to the lumenal surface (PubMed:10191259, PubMed:10893425, PubMed:12216837). Has a higher cholinephosphotransferase activity than ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity (PubMed:10191259, PubMed:12216837).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Nucleus membrane
