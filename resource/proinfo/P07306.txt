UniprotID	P07306
Accession	P07306;I3L1X1
EntryName	ASGR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 (ASGP-R 1) (ASGPR 1) (C-type lectin domain family 4 member H1) (Hepatic lectin H1) (HL-1)
GeneName	ASGR1 CLEC4H1
Length	291
Function	Mediates the endocytosis of plasma glycoproteins to which the terminal sialic acid residue on their complex carbohydrate moieties has been removed. The receptor recognizes terminal galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine units. After ligand binding to the receptor, the resulting complex is internalized and transported to a sorting organelle, where receptor and ligand are disassociated. The receptor then returns to the cell membrane surface.
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Secreted
