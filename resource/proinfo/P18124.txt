UniprotID	P18124
Accession	P18124;A8K504;Q15289;Q3KQU0;Q5I0X1;Q6IBM9
EntryName	RL7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein uL30 (60S ribosomal protein L7)
GeneName	RPL7
Length	248
Function	Component of the large ribosomal subunit (PubMed:12962325, PubMed:23636399, PubMed:32669547). The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:12962325, PubMed:23636399, PubMed:32669547). Binds to G-rich structures in 28S rRNA and in mRNAs (PubMed:12962325). Plays a regulatory role in the translation apparatus; inhibits cell-free translation of mRNAs (PubMed:12962325).
