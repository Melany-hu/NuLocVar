EntryName	PTPA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A activator (EC 5.2.1.8) (PP2A, subunit B', PR53 isoform) (Phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator) (PTPA) (Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit 4) (Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B')
GeneName	PTPA PPP2R4
Length	358
Function	PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. It catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides (By similarity). Acts as a regulatory subunit for serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (PubMed:16916641, PubMed:36073231). Modulates PP2A activity or substrate specificity, probably by inducing a conformational change in the catalytic subunit, a proposed direct target of the PPIase (PubMed:16916641). Can reactivate inactive phosphatase PP2A-phosphatase methylesterase complexes (PP2A(i)) in presence of ATP and Mg(2+) (By similarity). Reversibly stimulates the variable phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activity of PP2A core heterodimer PP2A(D) in presence of ATP and Mg(2+) (in vitro) (PubMed:16916641). The phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activity is dependent of an ATPase activity of the PP2A(D):PPP2R4 complex (PubMed:16916641). Is involved in apoptosis; the function appears to be independent from PP2A (PubMed:17333320).
