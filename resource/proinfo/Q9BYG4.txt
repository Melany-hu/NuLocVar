UniprotID	Q9BYG4
Accession	Q9BYG4;A8QM57
EntryName	PAR6G_HUMAN
ProteinName	Partitioning defective 6 homolog gamma (PAR-6 gamma) (PAR6D)
GeneName	PARD6G PAR6G
Length	376
Function	Adapter protein involved in asymmetrical cell division and cell polarization processes. May play a role in the formation of epithelial tight junctions. The PARD6-PARD3 complex links GTP-bound Rho small GTPases to atypical protein kinase C proteins (By similarity).
