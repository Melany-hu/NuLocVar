UniprotID	Q3LIE5
Accession	Q3LIE5;A8K9B4;D3DTS4;Q9BVD4;Q9NRU8
EntryName	ADPRM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Manganese-dependent ADP-ribose/CDP-alcohol diphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.13) (EC 3.6.1.16) (EC 3.6.1.53) (ADPRibase-Mn) (CDP-choline phosphohydrolase)
GeneName	ADPRM C17orf48 MDS006 Nbla03831
Length	342
Function	Hydrolyzes ADP-ribose, IDP-ribose, CDP-glycerol, CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine, but not other non-reducing ADP-sugars or CDP-glucose. May be involved in immune cell signaling as suggested by the second-messenger role of ADP-ribose, which activates TRPM2 as a mediator of oxidative/nitrosative stress (By similarity).
