UniprotID	Q8NHR9
Accession	Q8NHR9;Q53TL9
EntryName	PROF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Profilin-4 (Profilin IV)
GeneName	PFN4
Length	129
Function	Involved in male fertility. Required for manchette development and acrosome biogenesis during spermiogenesis (By similarity). Binds in vitro to phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) and phosphatidic acid (PA) (PubMed:19419568). Contrary to other profilin family members, does not bind to actin in vitro (PubMed:19419568).
