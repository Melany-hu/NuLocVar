UniprotID	Q96FM1
Accession	Q96FM1;B4DGK7;Q86Z03;Q8NBJ8
EntryName	PGAP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Post-GPI attachment to proteins factor 3 (COS16 homolog) (hCOS16) (Gene coamplified with ERBB2 protein) (PER1-like domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	PGAP3 CAB2 PERLD1 UNQ546/PRO1100
Length	320
Function	Involved in the lipid remodeling steps of GPI-anchor maturation. Lipid remodeling steps consist in the generation of 2 saturated fatty chains at the sn-2 position of GPI-anchors proteins. Required for phospholipase A2 activity that removes an acyl-chain at the sn-2 position of GPI-anchors during the remodeling of GPI.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
