UniprotID	Q9H2B2
Accession	Q9H2B2;B4DEU3;Q9P2K4
EntryName	SYT4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Synaptotagmin-4 (Synaptotagmin IV) (SytIV)
GeneName	SYT4 KIAA1342
Length	425
Function	Synaptotagmin family member which does not bind Ca(2+) (By similarity) (PubMed:23999003). Involved in neuronal dense core vesicles (DCVs) mobility through its interaction with KIF1A. Upon increased neuronal activity, phosphorylation by MAPK8/JNK1 destabilizes the interaction with KIF1A and captures DCVs to synapses (By similarity). Plays a role in dendrite formation by melanocytes (PubMed:23999003).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Neuronal dense core vesicle membrane
