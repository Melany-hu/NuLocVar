EntryName	S2546_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial outer membrane protein SLC25A46 (Solute carrier family 25 member 46)
GeneName	SLC25A46 TB1
Length	418
Function	Transmembrane protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane that controls mitochondrial organization (PubMed:26168012, PubMed:27390132, PubMed:27543974). May regulate the assembly of the MICOS (mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system) complex which is essential to the biogenesis and dynamics of mitochondrial cristae, the inwards folds of the inner mitochondrial membrane (PubMed:27390132). Through its interaction with the EMC (endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex), could regulate mitochondrial lipid homeostasis and thereby mitochondrial fission (PubMed:27390132).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane
