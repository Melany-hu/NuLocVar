UniprotID	P48169
Accession	P48169;Q8IYR7
EntryName	GBRA4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-4 (GABA(A) receptor subunit alpha-4) (GABAAR subunit alpha-4)
GeneName	GABRA4
Length	554
Function	Alpha subunit of the heteropentameric ligand-gated chloride channel gated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain (PubMed:35355020). GABA-gated chloride channels, also named GABA(A) receptors (GABAAR), consist of five subunits arranged around a central pore and contain GABA active binding site(s) located at the alpha and beta subunit interface(s) (PubMed:35355020). When activated by GABA, GABAARs selectively allow the flow of chloride anions across the cell membrane down their electrochemical gradient (PubMed:35355020). GABAARs containing alpha-4 are predominantly extrasynaptic, contributing to tonic inhibition in dentate granule cells and thalamic relay neurons (By similarity). Extrasynaptic alpha-4-containing GABAARs control levels of excitability and network activity (By similarity). GABAAR containing alpha-4-beta-3-delta subunits can simultaneously bind GABA and histamine where histamine binds at the interface of two neighboring beta subunits, which may be involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness (PubMed:35355020).
