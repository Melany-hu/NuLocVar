UniprotID	P50151
Accession	P50151;Q3B7K2;Q4VC27
EntryName	GBG10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(O) subunit gamma-10
GeneName	GNG10 GNGT10
Length	68
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction. Interacts with beta-1 and beta-2, but not with beta-3.
