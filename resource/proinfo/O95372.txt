UniprotID	O95372
Accession	O95372;Q7Z4Z2
EntryName	LYPA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acyl-protein thioesterase 2 (APT-2) (EC 3.1.2.-) (Lysophospholipase II) (LPL-II) (LysoPLA II) (Palmitoyl-protein hydrolase) (EC 3.1.2.22)
GeneName	LYPLA2 APT2
Length	231
Function	Acts as an acyl-protein thioesterase hydrolyzing fatty acids from S-acylated cysteine residues in proteins such as trimeric G alpha proteins, GSDMD, GAP43, ZDHHC6 or HRAS (PubMed:21152083, PubMed:28826475). Deacylates GAP43 (PubMed:21152083). Mediates depalmitoylation of ZDHHC6 (PubMed:28826475). Has lysophospholipase activity (PubMed:25301951). Hydrolyzes prostaglandin glycerol esters (PG-Gs) in the following order prostaglandin D2-glycerol ester (PGD2-G) > prostaglandin E2 glycerol ester (PGE2-G) > prostaglandin F2-alpha-glycerol ester (PGF2-alpha-G) (PubMed:25301951). Hydrolyzes 1-arachidonoylglycerol but not 2-arachidonoylglycerol or arachidonoylethanolamide (PubMed:25301951).
