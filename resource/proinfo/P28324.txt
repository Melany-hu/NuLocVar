UniprotID	P28324
Accession	P28324;P28323;Q6GSJ2
EntryName	ELK4_HUMAN
ProteinName	ETS domain-containing protein Elk-4 (Serum response factor accessory protein 1) (SAP-1) (SRF accessory protein 1)
GeneName	ELK4 SAP1
Length	431
Function	Involved in both transcriptional activation and repression. Interaction with SIRT7 leads to recruitment and stabilization of SIRT7 at promoters, followed by deacetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-18' (H3K18Ac) and subsequent transcription repression. Forms a ternary complex with the serum response factor (SRF). Requires DNA-bound SRF for ternary complex formation and makes extensive DNA contacts to the 5'side of SRF, but does not bind DNA autonomously.
