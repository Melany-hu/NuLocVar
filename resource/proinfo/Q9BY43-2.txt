UniprotID	Q9BY43-2
Accession	Q9BY43;Q14D22;Q32Q79;Q86SZ8;Q96QJ9;Q9P026
EntryName	CHM4A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Charged multivesicular body protein 4a (Chromatin-modifying protein 4a) (CHMP4a) (SNF7 homolog associated with Alix-2) (SNF7-1) (hSnf-1) (Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 32-1) (Vps32-1) (hVps32-1)
GeneName	CHMP4A C14orf123 SHAX2 CDA04 HSPC134
Length	265
Function	Probable core component of the endosomal sorting required for transport complex III (ESCRT-III) which is involved in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. When overexpressed, membrane-assembled circular arrays of CHMP4A filaments can promote or stabilize negative curvature and outward budding. Via its interaction with PDCD6IP involved in HIV-1 p6- and p9-dependent virus release. CHMP4A/B/C are required for the exosomal release of SDCBP, CD63 and syndecan (PubMed:22660413).
