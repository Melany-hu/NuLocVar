UniprotID	P30405
Accession	P30405;Q2YDB7;Q5W131
EntryName	PPIF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase F, mitochondrial (PPIase F) (EC 5.2.1.8) (Cyclophilin D) (CyP-D) (CypD) (Cyclophilin F) (Mitochondrial cyclophilin) (CyP-M) (Rotamase F)
GeneName	PPIF CYP3
Length	207
Function	PPIase that catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and may therefore assist protein folding (PubMed:20676357). Involved in regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) (PubMed:26387735). It is proposed that its association with the mPTP is masking a binding site for inhibiting inorganic phosphate (Pi) and promotes the open probability of the mPTP leading to apoptosis or necrosis; the requirement of the PPIase activity for this function is debated (PubMed:26387735). In cooperation with mitochondrial p53/TP53 is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis (PubMed:22726440). Involved in modulation of mitochondrial membrane F(1)F(0) ATP synthase activity and regulation of mitochondrial matrix adenine nucleotide levels (By similarity). Has anti-apoptotic activity independently of mPTP and in cooperation with BCL2 inhibits cytochrome c-dependent apoptosis (PubMed:19228691).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
