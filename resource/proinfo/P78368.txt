ProteinName	Casein kinase I isoform gamma-2 (CKI-gamma 2) (EC 2.7.11.1)
GeneName	CSNK1G2 CK1G2
Length	415
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase. Casein kinases are operationally defined by their preferential utilization of acidic proteins such as caseins as substrates. It can phosphorylate a large number of proteins. Participates in Wnt signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylates COL4A3BP/CERT, MTA1 and SMAD3. SMAD3 phosphorylation promotes its ligand-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation, thus inhibiting SMAD3-mediated TGF-beta responses. Hyperphosphorylation of the serine-repeat motif of COL4A3BP/CERT leads to its inactivation by dissociation from the Golgi complex, thus down-regulating ER-to-Golgi transport of ceramide and sphingomyelin synthesis. Triggers PER1 proteasomal degradation probably through phosphorylation (PubMed:15077195, PubMed:15917222, PubMed:18794808, PubMed:19005213). Involved in brain development and vesicular trafficking and neurotransmitter releasing from small synaptic vesicles. Regulates fast synaptic transmission mediated by glutamate (By similarity). Involved in regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (PubMed:37099597).
