UniprotID	Q5T4F7
Accession	Q5T4F7;O14780;Q86TH7
EntryName	SFRP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (sFRP-5) (Frizzled-related protein 1b) (FRP-1b) (Secreted apoptosis-related protein 3) (SARP-3)
GeneName	SFRP5 FRP1B SARP3
Length	317
Function	Soluble frizzled-related proteins (sFRPS) function as modulators of Wnt signaling through direct interaction with Wnts. They have a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation in specific cell types. SFRP5 may be involved in determining the polarity of photoreceptor, and perhaps, other cells in the retina.
