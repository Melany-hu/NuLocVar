UniprotID	Q00577
Accession	Q00577
EntryName	PURA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcriptional activator protein Pur-alpha (Purine-rich single-stranded DNA-binding protein alpha)
GeneName	PURA PUR1
Length	322
Function	This is a probable transcription activator that specifically binds the purine-rich single strand of the PUR element located upstream of the MYC gene (PubMed:1448097, PubMed:20976240). May play a role in the initiation of DNA replication and in recombination.
