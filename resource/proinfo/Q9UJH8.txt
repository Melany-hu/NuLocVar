UniprotID	Q9UJH8
Accession	Q9UJH8;Q9UJH9
EntryName	METRN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Meteorin
GeneName	METRN C16orf23 RJD6
Length	293
Function	Involved in both glial cell differentiation and axonal network formation during neurogenesis. Promotes astrocyte differentiation and transforms cerebellar astrocytes into radial glia. Also induces axonal extension in small and intermediate neurons of sensory ganglia by activating nearby satellite glia (By similarity).
