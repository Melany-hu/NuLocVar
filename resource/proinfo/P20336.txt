EntryName	RAB3A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-3A (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB3A
Length	220
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes (PubMed:2501306). Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (PubMed:2501306). RAB3A plays a central role in regulated exocytosis and secretion. Controls the recruitment, tethering and docking of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane (PubMed:2501306). Upon stimulation, switches to its active GTP-bound form, cycles to vesicles and recruits effectors such as RIMS1, RIMS2, Rabphilin-3A/RPH3A, RPH3AL or SYTL4 to help the docking of vesicules onto the plasma membrane (By similarity). Upon GTP hydrolysis by GTPase-activating protein, dissociates from the vesicle membrane allowing the exocytosis to proceed (By similarity). Stimulates insulin secretion through interaction with RIMS2 or RPH3AL effectors in pancreatic beta cells (By similarity). Regulates calcium-dependent lysosome exocytosis and plasma membrane repair (PMR) via the interaction with 2 effectors, SYTL4 and myosin-9/MYH9 (PubMed:27325790). Acts as a positive regulator of acrosome content secretion in sperm cells by interacting with RIMS1 (PubMed:22248876, PubMed:30599141). Also plays a role in the regulation of dopamine release by interacting with synaptotagmin I/SYT (By similarity).
