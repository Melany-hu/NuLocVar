UniprotID	O14684
Accession	O14684;O14900;Q5SZC0
EntryName	PTGES_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostaglandin E synthase (EC 5.3.99.3) (Glutathione peroxidase PTGES) (EC 1.11.1.-) (Glutathione transferase PTGES) (EC 2.5.1.18) (Microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1-like 1) (MGST1-L1) (Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 1) (MPGES-1) (p53-induced gene 12 protein)
GeneName	PTGES MGST1L1 MPGES1 PGES PIG12
Length	152
Function	Terminal enzyme of the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) biosynthetic pathway. Catalyzes the glutathione-dependent oxidoreduction of prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in response to inflammatory stimuli (PubMed:10377395, PubMed:10869354, PubMed:12244105, PubMed:12460774, PubMed:12672824, PubMed:18682561). Plays a key role in inflammation response, fever and pain (By similarity). Also catalyzes the oxidoreduction of endocannabinoids into prostaglandin glycerol esters and PGG2 into 15-hydroperoxy-PGE2 (PubMed:12244105, PubMed:12672824). In addition, displays low glutathione transferase and glutathione-dependent peroxidase activities, toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 5-hydroperoxyicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), respectively (PubMed:12672824).
