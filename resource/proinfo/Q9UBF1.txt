UniprotID	Q9UBF1
Accession	Q9UBF1;Q5JZ00;Q96D45;Q9P1M6;Q9P1M7
EntryName	MAGC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Melanoma-associated antigen C2 (Cancer/testis antigen 10) (CT10) (Hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 587) (MAGE-C2 antigen) (MAGE-E1 antigen)
GeneName	MAGEC2 HCA587 MAGEE1
Length	373
Function	Proposed to enhance ubiquitin ligase activity of RING-type zinc finger-containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. In vitro enhances ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM28 and stimulates p53/TP53 ubiquitination in presence of Ubl-conjugating enzyme UBE2H leading to p53/TP53 degradation. Proposed to act through recruitment and/or stabilization of the Ubl-conjugating enzymes (E2) at the E3:substrate complex.
