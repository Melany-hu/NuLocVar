EntryName	FOXC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Forkhead box protein C1 (Forkhead-related protein FKHL7) (Forkhead-related transcription factor 3) (FREAC-3)
GeneName	FOXC1 FKHL7 FREAC3
Length	553
Function	DNA-binding transcriptional factor that plays a role in a broad range of cellular and developmental processes such as eye, bones, cardiovascular, kidney and skin development (PubMed:11782474, PubMed:14506133, PubMed:14578375, PubMed:15277473, PubMed:15299087, PubMed:15684392, PubMed:16449236, PubMed:16492674, PubMed:17210863, PubMed:19279310, PubMed:19793056, PubMed:25786029, PubMed:27804176, PubMed:27907090). Acts either as a transcriptional activator or repressor (PubMed:11782474). Binds to the consensus binding site 5'-AAAAA-3' in promoter of target genes (PubMed:11782474, PubMed:12533514, PubMed:14506133, PubMed:19793056, PubMed:27804176, PubMed:7957066). Upon DNA-binding, promotes DNA bending (PubMed:14506133, PubMed:7957066). Acts as a transcriptional coactivator (PubMed:26565916). Stimulates Indian hedgehog (Ihh)-induced target gene expression mediated by the transcription factor GLI2, and hence regulates endochondral ossification (By similarity). Also acts as a transcriptional coregulator by increasing DNA-binding capacity of GLI2 in breast cancer cells (PubMed:26565916). Regulates FOXO1 through binding to a conserved element, 5'-GTAAACAAA-3' in its promoter region, implicating FOXC1 as an important regulator of cell viability and resistance to oxidative stress in the eye (PubMed:17993506). Cooperates with transcription factor FOXC2 in regulating expression of genes that maintain podocyte integrity (By similarity). Promotes cell growth inhibition by stopping the cell cycle in the G1 phase through TGFB1-mediated signals (PubMed:12408963). Involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction by increasing cell proliferation, migration and invasion (PubMed:20406990, PubMed:22991501). Involved in chemokine CXCL12-induced endothelial cell migration through the control of CXCR4 expression (By similarity). Plays a role in the gene regulatory network essential for epidermal keratinocyte terminal differentiation (PubMed:27907090). Essential developmental transcriptional factor required for mesoderm-derived tissues, such as the somites, skin, bone and cartilage. Positively regulates CXCL12 and stem cell factor expression in bone marrow mesenchymal progenitor cells, and hence plays a role in the development and maintenance of mesenchymal niches for haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). Plays a role in corneal transparency by preventing both blood vessel and lymphatic vessel growth during embryonic development in a VEGF-dependent manner. Involved in chemokine CXCL12-induced endothelial cell migration through the control of CXCR4 expression (By similarity). May function as a tumor suppressor (PubMed:12408963).
