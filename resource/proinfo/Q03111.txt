UniprotID	Q03111
Accession	Q03111;Q14768
EntryName	ENL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein ENL (YEATS domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	MLLT1 ENL LTG19 YEATS1
Length	559
Function	Chromatin reader component of the super elongation complex (SEC), a complex required to increase the catalytic rate of RNA polymerase II transcription by suppressing transient pausing by the polymerase at multiple sites along the DNA (PubMed:20159561, PubMed:20471948). Specifically recognizes and binds acetylated and crotonylated histones, with a preference for histones that are crotonylated (PubMed:27105114). Has a slightly higher affinity for binding histone H3 crotonylated at 'Lys-27' (H3K27cr) than 'Lys-20' (H3K9cr20) (PubMed:27105114).
