UniprotID	O95169
Accession	O95169;A8K0L4;Q5W143;Q5W144;Q5W145;Q9UG53;Q9UJR4;Q9UQF3
EntryName	NDUB8_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 8, mitochondrial (Complex I-ASHI) (CI-ASHI) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase ASHI subunit)
GeneName	NDUFB8
Length	186
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
