UniprotID	Q96GV9
Accession	Q96GV9
EntryName	MACIR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Macrophage immunometabolism regulator
GeneName	MACIR C5orf30
Length	206
Function	Regulates the macrophage function, by enhancing the resolution of inflammation and wound repair functions mediated by M2 macrophages (PubMed:30659109). The regulation of macrophage function is, due at least in part, to its ability to inhibit glycolysis (PubMed:30659109). May also play a role in trafficking of proteins via its interaction with UNC119 and UNC119B cargo adapters: may help the release of UNC119 and UNC119B cargo or the recycling of UNC119 and UNC119B (PubMed:22085962). May play a role in ciliary membrane localization via its interaction with UNC119B and protein transport into photoreceptor cells (PubMed:22085962).
