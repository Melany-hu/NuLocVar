ProteinName	DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 11 (APOBEC1-binding protein 2) (ABBP-2) (DnaJ protein homolog 9) (ER-associated DNAJ) (ER-associated Hsp40 co-chaperone) (Endoplasmic reticulum DNA J domain-containing protein 3) (ER-resident protein ERdj3) (ERdj3) (ERj3p) (HEDJ) (Human DnaJ protein 9) (hDj-9) (PWP1-interacting protein 4)
GeneName	DNAJB11 EDJ ERJ3 HDJ9 PSEC0121 UNQ537/PRO1080
Length	358
Function	As a co-chaperone for HSPA5 it is required for proper folding, trafficking or degradation of proteins (PubMed:10827079, PubMed:15525676, PubMed:29706351). Binds directly to both unfolded proteins that are substrates for ERAD and nascent unfolded peptide chains, but dissociates from the HSPA5-unfolded protein complex before folding is completed (PubMed:15525676). May help recruiting HSPA5 and other chaperones to the substrate. Stimulates HSPA5 ATPase activity (PubMed:10827079). It is necessary for maturation and correct trafficking of PKD1 (PubMed:29706351).
