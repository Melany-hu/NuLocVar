EntryName	WWOX_HUMAN
ProteinName	WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.-) (Fragile site FRA16D oxidoreductase) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 41C member 1)
GeneName	WWOX FOR SDR41C1 WOX1
Length	414
Function	Putative oxidoreductase. Acts as a tumor suppressor and plays a role in apoptosis. Required for normal bone development (By similarity). May function synergistically with p53/TP53 to control genotoxic stress-induced cell death. Plays a role in TGFB1 signaling and TGFB1-mediated cell death. May also play a role in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated cell death. Inhibits Wnt signaling, probably by sequestering DVL2 in the cytoplasm.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Mitochondrion; Golgi apparatus; Lysosome
