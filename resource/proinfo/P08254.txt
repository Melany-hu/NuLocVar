EntryName	MMP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Stromelysin-1 (SL-1) (EC 3.4.24.17) (Matrix metalloproteinase-3) (MMP-3) (Transin-1)
GeneName	MMP3 STMY1
Length	477
Function	Metalloproteinase with a rather broad substrate specificity that can degrade fibronectin, laminin, gelatins of type I, III, IV, and V; collagens III, IV, X, and IX, and cartilage proteoglycans. Activates different molecules including growth factors, plasminogen or other matrix metalloproteinases such as MMP9 (PubMed:11029580, PubMed:1371271). Once released into the extracellular matrix (ECM), the inactive pro-enzyme is activated by the plasmin cascade signaling pathway (PubMed:2383557). Also acts intracellularly (PubMed:22265821). For example, in dopaminergic neurons, gets activated by the serine protease HTRA2 upon stress and plays a pivotal role in DA neuronal degeneration by mediating microglial activation and alpha-synuclein/SNCA cleavage (PubMed:21330369). In addition, plays a role in immune response and possesses antiviral activity against various viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus, influenza A virus (H1N1) and human herpes virus 1 (PubMed:35940311). Mechanistically, translocates from the cytoplasm into the cell nucleus upon virus infection to influence NF-kappa-B activities (PubMed:35940311).
