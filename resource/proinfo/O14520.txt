EntryName	AQP7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aquaporin-7 (AQP-7) (Aquaglyceroporin-7) (Aquaporin adipose) (AQPap) (Aquaporin-7-like)
GeneName	AQP7 AQP7L AQP9
Length	342
Function	Aquaglyceroporins form homotetrameric transmembrane channels, with each monomer independently mediating glycerol and water transport across the plasma membrane along their osmotic gradient (PubMed:11952783, PubMed:30420639, PubMed:30423801, PubMed:36737436, PubMed:9405233). Could also be permeable to urea (PubMed:9405233). Mediates the efflux of glycerol, formed upon triglyceride hydrolysis, to avoid its accumulation in adipocytes and to make it available to other tissues. In the kidney, mediates the reabsorption of glycerol, preventing its loss in urine, again participating to energy homeostasis. In pancreatic beta cells, it also mediates the efflux of glycerol, regulating its intracellular levels (By similarity).
