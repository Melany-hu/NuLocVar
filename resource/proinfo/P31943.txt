Accession	P31943;B3KW86;D3DWQ2;Q6IBM4
EntryName	HNRH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (hnRNP H) [Cleaved into: Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	HNRNPH1 HNRPH HNRPH1
Length	449
Function	This protein is a component of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes which provide the substrate for the processing events that pre-mRNAs undergo before becoming functional, translatable mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Mediates pre-mRNA alternative splicing regulation. Inhibits, together with CUGBP1, insulin receptor (IR) pre-mRNA exon 11 inclusion in myoblast. Binds to the IR RNA. Binds poly(RG).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleoplasm
