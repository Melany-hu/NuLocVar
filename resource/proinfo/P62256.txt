UniprotID	P62256
Accession	P62256;A4D1L6;C9JY93;P37286;Q7Z6F4
EntryName	UBE2H_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 H (EC 2.3.2.23) ((E3-independent) E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme H) (EC 2.3.2.24) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme H) (UbcH2) (Ubiquitin carrier protein H) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-20K) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase H)
GeneName	UBE2H
Length	183
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins (PubMed:17588522, PubMed:20061386, PubMed:8132613). E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme that transfers ubiquitin to MAEA, a core component of the CTLH E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (PubMed:29911972). In vitro catalyzes 'Lys-11'- and 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:20061386). Capable, in vitro, to ubiquitinate histone H2A (PubMed:8132613).
