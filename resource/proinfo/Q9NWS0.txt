UniprotID	Q9NWS0
Accession	Q9NWS0;B4DGN7;B4E2X7;Q9BVL0
EntryName	PIHD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	PIH1 domain-containing protein 1 (Nucleolar protein 17 homolog)
GeneName	PIH1D1 NOP17
Length	290
Function	Involved in the assembly of C/D box small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) particles (PubMed:17636026). Recruits the SWI/SNF complex to the core promoter of rRNA genes and enhances pre-rRNA transcription (PubMed:22368283, PubMed:24036451). Mediates interaction of TELO2 with the R2TP complex which is necessary for the stability of MTOR and SMG1 (PubMed:20864032). Positively regulates the assembly and activity of the mTORC1 complex (PubMed:24036451).
