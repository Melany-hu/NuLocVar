UniprotID	Q15465
Accession	Q15465;A4D247;Q75MC9
EntryName	SHH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sonic hedgehog protein (SHH) (EC 3.1.-.-) (HHG-1) (Shh unprocessed N-terminal signaling and C-terminal autoprocessing domains) (ShhNC) [Cleaved into: Sonic hedgehog protein N-product (ShhN) (Shh N-terminal processed signaling domains) (ShhNp)]
GeneName	SHH
Length	462
Function	The C-terminal part of the sonic hedgehog protein precursor displays an autoproteolysis and a cholesterol transferase activity (By similarity). Both activities result in the cleavage of the full-length protein into two parts (ShhN and ShhC) followed by the covalent attachment of a cholesterol moiety to the C-terminal of the newly generated ShhN (By similarity). Both activities occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (By similarity). Once cleaved, ShhC is degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Secreted; Cell membrane
