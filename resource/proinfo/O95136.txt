UniprotID	O95136
Accession	O95136;Q86UN8
EntryName	S1PR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1P receptor 2) (S1P2) (Endothelial differentiation G-protein coupled receptor 5) (Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor Edg-5) (S1P receptor Edg-5)
GeneName	S1PR2 EDG5
Length	353
Function	Receptor for the lysosphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) (PubMed:10617617, PubMed:25274307). S1P is a bioactive lysophospholipid that elicits diverse physiological effects on most types of cells and tissues (PubMed:10617617). When expressed in rat HTC4 hepatoma cells, is capable of mediating S1P-induced cell proliferation and suppression of apoptosis (PubMed:10617617). Receptor for the chemokine-like protein FAM19A5 (PubMed:29453251). Mediates the inhibitory effect of FAM19A5 on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration (By similarity). In lymphoid follicles, couples the binding of S1P to the activation of GNA13 and downstream inhibition of AKT activation leading to suppression of germinal center (GC) B cell growth and migration outside the GC niche.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
