UniprotID	Q9HB15
Accession	Q9HB15
EntryName	KCNKC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Potassium channel subfamily K member 12 (Tandem pore domain halothane-inhibited potassium channel 2) (THIK-2)
GeneName	KCNK12
Length	430
Function	K(+) channel subunit that may homo- and heterodimerize to form functional channels with distinct regulatory and gating properties. Can heterodimerize with KCNK13 subunit to conduct K(+) outward rectifying currents at the plasma membrane. The homodimers are mainly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment and may be targeted to the cell surface upon phosphorylation or other activation signals yet to be elucidated.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
