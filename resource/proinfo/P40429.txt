UniprotID	P40429
Accession	P40429;A8K505
EntryName	RL13A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein uL13 (23 kDa highly basic protein) (60S ribosomal protein L13a)
GeneName	RPL13A
Length	203
Function	Associated with ribosomes but is not required for canonical ribosome function and has extra-ribosomal functions (PubMed:14567916, PubMed:17218275, PubMed:23636399, PubMed:32669547). Component of the GAIT (gamma interferon-activated inhibitor of translation) complex which mediates interferon-gamma-induced transcript-selective translation inhibition in inflammation processes (PubMed:23071094). Upon interferon-gamma activation and subsequent phosphorylation dissociates from the ribosome and assembles into the GAIT complex which binds to stem loop-containing GAIT elements in the 3'-UTR of diverse inflammatory mRNAs (such as ceruplasmin) and suppresses their translation (PubMed:23071094). In the GAIT complex interacts with m7G cap-bound eIF4G at or near the eIF3-binding site and blocks the recruitment of the 43S ribosomal complex (PubMed:23071094). Involved in methylation of rRNA (PubMed:17921318).
