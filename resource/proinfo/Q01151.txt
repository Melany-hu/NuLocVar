UniprotID	Q01151
Accession	Q01151;Q5THX9
EntryName	CD83_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD83 antigen (hCD83) (B-cell activation protein) (Cell surface protein HB15) (CD antigen CD83)
GeneName	CD83
Length	205
Function	Transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly found on the surface of many immune cells including dendritic cells or lymphocytes that plays various roles in immune response regulation. Plays an essential role in CD4(+) T-selection, differentiation and stability by regulating the activity of the major E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for controlling MHCII trafficking MARCHF8. Also inhibits MARCHF1 association with MHCII or CD86 to prevent their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (PubMed:21220452). In addition, acts as an important modulator of protective responses against acute infections (By similarity).
