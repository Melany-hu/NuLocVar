UniprotID	Q15904
Accession	Q15904;A6ZKI4;Q8NBT4;Q9H0C7
EntryName	VAS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit S1 (V-ATPase subunit S1) (Protein XAP-3) (V-ATPase Ac45 subunit) (V-ATPase S1 accessory protein) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit S1)
GeneName	ATP6AP1 ATP6IP1 ATP6S1 VATPS1 XAP3
Length	470
Function	Accessory subunit of the proton-transporting vacuolar (V)-ATPase protein pump, which is required for luminal acidification of secretory vesicles (PubMed:33065002). Guides the V-type ATPase into specialized subcellular compartments, such as neuroendocrine regulated secretory vesicles or the ruffled border of the osteoclast, thereby regulating its activity (PubMed:27231034). Involved in membrane trafficking and Ca(2+)-dependent membrane fusion (PubMed:27231034). May play a role in the assembly of the V-type ATPase complex (Probable). In aerobic conditions, involved in intracellular iron homeostasis, thus triggering the activity of Fe(2+) prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes, and leading to HIF1A hydroxylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:28296633). In islets of Langerhans cells, may regulate the acidification of dense-core secretory granules (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane
