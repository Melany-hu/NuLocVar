UniprotID	P05230
Accession	P05230;B2R5T0;D3DQF2;P07502;Q16588
EntryName	FGF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1) (Acidic fibroblast growth factor) (aFGF) (Endothelial cell growth factor) (ECGF) (Heparin-binding growth factor 1) (HBGF-1)
GeneName	FGF1 FGFA
Length	155
Function	Plays an important role in the regulation of cell survival, cell division, angiogenesis, cell differentiation and cell migration. Functions as a potent mitogen in vitro. Acts as a ligand for FGFR1 and integrins. Binds to FGFR1 in the presence of heparin leading to FGFR1 dimerization and activation via sequential autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues which act as docking sites for interacting proteins, leading to the activation of several signaling cascades. Binds to integrin ITGAV:ITGB3. Its binding to integrin, subsequent ternary complex formation with integrin and FGFR1, and the recruitment of PTPN11 to the complex are essential for FGF1 signaling. Induces the phosphorylation and activation of FGFR1, FRS2, MAPK3/ERK1, MAPK1/ERK2 and AKT1 (PubMed:18441324, PubMed:20422052). Can induce angiogenesis (PubMed:23469107).
