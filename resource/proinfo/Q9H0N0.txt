EntryName	RAB6C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-6C (EC 3.6.5.2) (Rab6-like protein WTH3)
GeneName	RAB6C WTH3
Length	254
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (By similarity). RAB6C may be involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication and cell cycle progression.
