UniprotID	Q9BQJ4
Accession	Q9BQJ4;Q5JR44
EntryName	TMM47_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 47 (Brain cell membrane protein 1) (Transmembrane 4 superfamily member 10)
GeneName	TMEM47 BCMP1 TM4SF10
Length	181
Function	Regulates cell junction organization in epithelial cells. May play a role in the transition from adherens junction to tight junction assembly. May regulate F-actin polymerization required for tight junctional localization dynamics and affect the junctional localization of PARD6B. During podocyte differentiation may negatively regulate activity of FYN and subsequently the abundance of nephrin (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Cell junction; Adherens junction
