UniprotID	Q2VIR3
Accession	Q2VIR3;F8W810;Q5I0X0;Q6KF84
EntryName	IF2GL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 3B (EC 3.6.5.3) (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit gamma A) (eIF-2-gamma A) (eIF-2gA)
GeneName	EIF2S3B
Length	472
Function	Member of the eIF2 complex that functions in the early steps of protein synthesis by forming a ternary complex with GTP and initiator tRNA. This complex binds to a 40S ribosomal subunit, followed by mRNA binding to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). Junction of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S initiation complex is preceded by hydrolysis of the GTP bound to eIF2 and release of an eIF2-GDP binary complex. In order for eIF2 to recycle and catalyze another round of initiation, the GDP bound to eIF2 must exchange with GTP by way of a reaction catalyzed by eIF-2B (By similarity).
