UniprotID	Q9UBU2
Accession	Q9UBU2;A0AVE9;B2R6S7;Q9UIU3
EntryName	DKK2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dickkopf-related protein 2 (Dickkopf-2) (Dkk-2) (hDkk-2)
GeneName	DKK2 UNQ682/PRO1316
Length	259
Function	Antagonizes canonical Wnt signaling by inhibiting LRP5/6 interaction with Wnt and by forming a ternary complex with the transmembrane protein KREMEN that promotes internalization of LRP5/6. DKKs play an important role in vertebrate development, where they locally inhibit Wnt regulated processes such as antero-posterior axial patterning, limb development, somitogenesis and eye formation. In the adult, Dkks are implicated in bone formation and bone disease, cancer and Alzheimer disease (By similarity).
