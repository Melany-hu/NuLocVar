UniprotID	Q6PCB8
Accession	Q6PCB8;B7Z6S3;B7Z902
EntryName	EMB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Embigin
GeneName	EMB
Length	327
Function	Plays a role in the outgrowth of motoneurons and in the formation of neuromuscular junctions. Following muscle denervation, promotes nerve terminal sprouting and the formation of additional acetylcholine receptor clusters at synaptic sites without affecting terminal Schwann cell number or morphology. Delays the retraction of terminal sprouts following re-innervation of denervated endplates. May play a role in targeting the monocarboxylate transporters SLC16A1, SLC16A6 and SLC16A7 to the cell membrane (By similarity).
