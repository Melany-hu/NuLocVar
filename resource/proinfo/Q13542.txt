UniprotID	Q13542
Accession	Q13542
EntryName	4EBP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2) (eIF4E-binding protein 2)
GeneName	EIF4EBP2
Length	120
Function	Repressor of translation initiation involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory formation (PubMed:30765518). Regulates EIF4E activity by preventing its assembly into the eIF4F complex: hypophosphorylated form of EIF4EBP2 competes with EIF4G1/EIF4G3 and strongly binds to EIF4E, leading to repress translation. In contrast, hyperphosphorylated form dissociates from EIF4E, allowing interaction between EIF4G1/EIF4G3 and EIF4E, leading to initiation of translation (PubMed:25533957, PubMed:30765518). EIF4EBP2 is enriched in brain and acts as a regulator of synapse activity and neuronal stem cell renewal via its ability to repress translation initiation (By similarity). Mediates the regulation of protein translation by hormones, growth factors and other stimuli that signal through the MAP kinase and mTORC1 pathways (By similarity).
