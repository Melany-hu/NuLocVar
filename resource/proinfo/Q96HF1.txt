UniprotID	Q96HF1
Accession	Q96HF1;B3KQR2;O14778;Q9HAP5
EntryName	SFRP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (FRP-2) (sFRP-2) (Secreted apoptosis-related protein 1) (SARP-1)
GeneName	SFRP2 FRP2 SARP1 FKSG12 UNQ361/PRO697
Length	295
Function	Soluble frizzled-related proteins (sFRPS) function as modulators of Wnt signaling through direct interaction with Wnts. They have a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation in specific cell types. SFRP2 may be important for eye retinal development and for myogenesis.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
