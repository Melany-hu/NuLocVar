UniprotID	P56211
Accession	P56211;B2R497;Q6IAM2;Q86TA6;Q9UD70
EntryName	ARP19_HUMAN
ProteinName	cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 19 (ARPP-19)
GeneName	ARPP19
Length	112
Function	Protein phosphatase inhibitor that specifically inhibits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) during mitosis (PubMed:38123684). Inhibition of PP2A is enhanced when ARPP19 is phosphorylated (PubMed:38123684). When phosphorylated at Ser-62 during mitosis, specifically interacts with PPP2R2D (PR55-delta) and inhibits its activity, leading to inactivation of PP2A, an essential condition to keep cyclin-B1-CDK1 activity high during M phase (PubMed:21164014). May indirectly enhance GAP-43 expression (By similarity).
