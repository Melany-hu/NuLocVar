EntryName	LDAF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lipid droplet assembly factor 1 (Promethin) (Transmembrane protein 159)
GeneName	LDAF1 TMEM159
Length	161
Function	Plays an important role in the formation of lipid droplets (LD) which are storage organelles at the center of lipid and energy homeostasis (PubMed:31708432). In association with BSCL2/seipin, defines the sites of LD formation in the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:31708432).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Lipid droplet
