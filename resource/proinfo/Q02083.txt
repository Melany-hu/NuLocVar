EntryName	NAAA_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase (EC 3.5.1.60) (Acid ceramidase-like protein) (Acylsphingosine deacylase NAAA) (EC 3.5.1.23) (N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase-like) (ASAH-like protein) [Cleaved into: N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase subunit alpha; N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase subunit beta]
GeneName	NAAA ASAHL PLT
Length	359
Function	Degrades bioactive fatty acid amides to their corresponding acids, with the following preference: N-palmitoylethanolamine > N-myristoylethanolamine > N-lauroylethanolamine = N-stearoylethanolamine > N-arachidonoylethanolamine > N-oleoylethanolamine (PubMed:15655246, PubMed:17980170, PubMed:18793752, PubMed:22825852, PubMed:30301806). Also exhibits weak hydrolytic activity against the ceramides N-lauroylsphingosine and N-palmitoylsphingosine (PubMed:15655246).
