UniprotID	A8MXZ3
Accession	A8MXZ3
EntryName	KRA91_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 9-1 (Keratin-associated protein 9-like 3)
GeneName	KRTAP9-1 KAP9.1 KRTAP9.1 KRTAP9L3
Length	250
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins (By similarity).
