UniprotID	Q8TCT8
Accession	Q8TCT8;B2RDS0;Q8TAW1;Q96SZ8
EntryName	SPP2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal peptide peptidase-like 2A (SPP-like 2A) (SPPL2a) (EC 3.4.23.-) (Intramembrane protease 3) (IMP-3) (Presenilin-like protein 2)
GeneName	SPPL2A IMP3 PSL2 PSEC0147
Length	520
Function	Intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease (I-CLiP) that cleaves type II membrane signal peptides in the hydrophobic plane of the membrane. Functions in FASLG, ITM2B and TNF processing (PubMed:16829951, PubMed:16829952, PubMed:17557115, PubMed:17965014). Catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of the anchored fragment of shed TNF-alpha (TNF), which promotes the release of the intracellular domain (ICD) for signaling to the nucleus (PubMed:16829952). Also responsible for the intramembrane cleavage of Fas antigen ligand FASLG, which promotes the release of the intracellular FasL domain (FasL ICD) (PubMed:17557115). Essential for degradation of the invariant chain CD74 that plays a central role in the function of antigen-presenting cells in the immune system (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity (PubMed:16829952). Catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of the simian foamy virus envelope glycoprotein gp130 independently of prior ectodomain shedding by furin or furin-like proprotein convertase (PC)-mediated cleavage proteolysis (PubMed:23132852).
