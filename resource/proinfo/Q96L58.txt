UniprotID	Q96L58
Accession	Q96L58;Q5T7M5
EntryName	B3GT6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 6 (Beta-1,3-GalTase 6) (Beta3Gal-T6) (Beta3GalT6) (EC 2.4.1.134) (GAG GalTII) (Galactosyltransferase II) (Galactosylxylosylprotein 3-beta-galactosyltransferase) (UDP-Gal:betaGal beta 1,3-galactosyltransferase polypeptide 6)
GeneName	B3GALT6
Length	329
Function	Beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase that transfers galactose from UDP-galactose to substrates with a terminal beta-linked galactose residue. Has a preference for galactose-beta-1,4-xylose that is found in the linker region of glycosaminoglycans, such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Has no activity towards substrates with terminal glucosamine or galactosamine residues.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack membrane
