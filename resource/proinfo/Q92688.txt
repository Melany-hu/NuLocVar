EntryName	AN32B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member B (Acidic protein rich in leucines) (Putative HLA-DR-associated protein I-2) (PHAPI2) (Silver-stainable protein SSP29)
GeneName	ANP32B APRIL PHAPI2
Length	251
Function	Multifunctional protein that is involved in the regulation of many processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle progression or transcription (PubMed:18039846, PubMed:20015864). Regulates the proliferation of neuronal stem cells, differentiation of leukemic cells and progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. As negative regulator of caspase-3-dependent apoptosis, may act as an antagonist of ANP32A in regulating tissue homeostasis (PubMed:20015864). Exhibits histone chaperone properties, able to recruit histones to certain promoters, thus regulating the transcription of specific genes (PubMed:18039846, PubMed:20538007). Also plays an essential role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of specific mRNAs via the uncommon nuclear mRNA export receptor XPO1/CRM1 (PubMed:17178712). Participates in the regulation of adequate adaptive immune responses by acting on mRNA expression and cell proliferation (By similarity).
