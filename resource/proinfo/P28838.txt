EntryName	AMPL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytosol aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.1) (Cysteinylglycine-S-conjugate dipeptidase) (EC 3.4.13.23) (Leucine aminopeptidase 3) (LAP-3) (Leucyl aminopeptidase) (Peptidase S) (Proline aminopeptidase) (EC 3.4.11.5) (Prolyl aminopeptidase)
GeneName	LAP3 LAPEP PEPS
Length	519
Function	Cytosolic metallopeptidase that catalyzes the removal of unsubstituted N-terminal hydrophobic amino acids from various peptides. The presence of Zn(2+) ions is essential for the peptidase activity, and the association with other cofactors can modulate the substrate spectificity of the enzyme. For instance, in the presence of Mn(2+), it displays a specific Cys-Gly hydrolyzing activity of Cys-Gly-S-conjugates. Involved in the metabolism of glutathione and in the degradation of glutathione S-conjugates, which may play a role in the control of the cell redox status.
