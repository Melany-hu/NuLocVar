UniprotID	Q9P1U1
Accession	Q9P1U1;A8MTG1;B4DFW4;Q7Z526;Q96BT2
EntryName	ARP3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Actin-related protein 3B (ARP3-beta) (Actin-like protein 3B) (Actin-related protein ARP4)
GeneName	ACTR3B ARP11 ARP4
Length	418
Function	Plays a role in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. May function as ATP-binding component of the Arp2/3 complex which is involved in regulation of actin polymerization and together with an activating nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) mediates the formation of branched actin networks. May decrease the metastatic potential of tumors.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cell projection
