UniprotID	P52907
Accession	P52907;Q53FQ6;Q6FHD5
EntryName	CAZA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-actin-capping protein subunit alpha-1 (CapZ alpha-1)
GeneName	CAPZA1
Length	286
Function	F-actin-capping proteins bind in a Ca(2+)-independent manner to the fast growing ends of actin filaments (barbed end) thereby blocking the exchange of subunits at these ends. Unlike other capping proteins (such as gelsolin and severin), these proteins do not sever actin filaments. May play a role in the formation of epithelial cell junctions (PubMed:22891260). Forms, with CAPZB, the barbed end of the fast growing ends of actin filaments in the dynactin complex and stabilizes dynactin structure. The dynactin multiprotein complex activates the molecular motor dynein for ultra-processive transport along microtubules (By similarity).
