UniprotID	Q0ZLH3
Accession	Q0ZLH3;A0PK14;B9EJE2
EntryName	PJVK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pejvakin (Autosomal recessive deafness type 59 protein)
GeneName	PJVK DFNB59
Length	352
Function	Peroxisome-associated protein required to protect auditory hair cells against noise-induced damage. Acts by regulating noise-induced peroxisome proliferation in auditory hair cells and neurons, and promoting autophagic degradation of damaged peroxisomes (pexophagy). Noise overexposure increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, causing oxidative damage to auditory hair cells and resulting in hearing loss. PJVK acts as a ROS sensor that recruits the autophagy machinery to trigger pexophagy of peroxisomes damaged by oxidative stress. In addition to pexophagy, also required to promote peroxisome proliferation in response to sound overstimulation.
Subcellular Location	Peroxisome membrane; Cell projection; Cilium
