UniprotID	O43159
Accession	O43159;Q7KZ78;Q9BVM6
EntryName	RRP8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosomal RNA-processing protein 8 (EC 2.1.1.-) (Cerebral protein 1) (Nucleomethylin)
GeneName	RRP8 KIAA0409 NML hucep-1
Length	456
Function	Essential component of the eNoSC (energy-dependent nucleolar silencing) complex, a complex that mediates silencing of rDNA in response to intracellular energy status and acts by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes. The eNoSC complex is able to sense the energy status of cell: upon glucose starvation, elevation of NAD(+)/NADP(+) ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3 deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me2) by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNA locus. In the complex, RRP8 binds to H3K9me2 and probably acts as a methyltransferase. Its substrates are however unknown.
