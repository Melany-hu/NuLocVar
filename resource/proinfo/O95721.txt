UniprotID	O95721
Accession	O95721
EntryName	SNP29_HUMAN
ProteinName	Synaptosomal-associated protein 29 (SNAP-29) (Soluble 29 kDa NSF attachment protein) (Vesicle-membrane fusion protein SNAP-29)
GeneName	SNAP29
Length	258
Function	SNAREs, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein receptors, are essential proteins for fusion of cellular membranes. SNAREs localized on opposing membranes assemble to form a trans-SNARE complex, an extended, parallel four alpha-helical bundle that drives membrane fusion. SNAP29 is a SNARE involved in autophagy through the direct control of autophagosome membrane fusion with the lysososome membrane. Also plays a role in ciliogenesis by regulating membrane fusions.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome membrane; Cell projection; Cilium membrane
