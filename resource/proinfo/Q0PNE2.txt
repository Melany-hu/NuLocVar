UniprotID	Q0PNE2
Accession	Q0PNE2;Q9BW57;Q9NXJ3
EntryName	ELP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Elongator complex protein 6 (Angiotonin-transactivated protein 1) (Protein TMEM103)
GeneName	ELP6 ATP1 C3orf75 TMEM103
Length	266
Function	Component of the elongator complex which is required for multiple tRNA modifications, including mcm5U (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl uridine), mcm5s2U (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine), and ncm5U (5-carbamoylmethyl uridine) (PubMed:29332244). The elongator complex catalyzes formation of carboxymethyluridine in the wobble base at position 34 in tRNAs (PubMed:22854966, PubMed:29332244). Involved in cell migration (By similarity).
