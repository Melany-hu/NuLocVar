UniprotID	Q96SQ7
Accession	Q96SQ7;Q504S2;Q659B0
EntryName	ATOH8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor ATOH8 (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 21) (bHLHa21) (Helix-loop-helix protein hATH-6) (hATH6) (Protein atonal homolog 8)
GeneName	ATOH8 ATH6 BHLHA21
Length	321
Function	Transcription factor that binds a palindromic (canonical) core consensus DNA sequence 5'-CANNTG- 3' known as an E-box element, possibly as a heterodimer with other bHLH proteins (PubMed:24236640). Regulates endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube-like structures formation (PubMed:24463812). Modulates endothelial cell differentiation through NOS3 (PubMed:24463812). May be implicated in specification and differentiation of neuronal cell lineages in the brain (By similarity). May participate in kidney development and may be involved in podocyte differentiation (By similarity). During early embryonic development is involved in tissue-specific differentiation processes that are dependent on class II bHLH factors and namely modulates the differentiation program initiated by the pro-endocrine factor NEUROG3 (By similarity). During myogenesis, may play a role during the transition of myoblasts from the proliferative phase to the differentiation phase (By similarity). Positively regulates HAMP transcription in two ways, firstly by acting directly on the HAMP promoter via E-boxes binding and indirectly through increased phosphorylation of SMAD protein complex (PubMed:24236640). Repress NEUROG3-dependent gene activation in a gene-specific manner through at least two mechanisms; requires only either the sequestering of a general partner such as TCF3 through heterodimerization, either also requires binding of the bHLH domain to DNA via a basic motif (By similarity).
