EntryName	HLAE_HUMAN
ProteinName	HLA class I histocompatibility antigen, alpha chain E (MHC class I antigen E) [Cleaved into: Soluble HLA class I histocompatibility antigen, alpha chain E (sHLA-E)]
GeneName	HLA-E HLA-6.2 HLAE
Length	358
Function	Non-classical major histocompatibility class Ib molecule involved in immune self-nonself discrimination. In complex with B2M/beta-2-microglobulin binds nonamer self-peptides derived from the signal sequence of classical MHC class Ia molecules (VL9 peptides - VMAPRTL) (PubMed:18083576, PubMed:18339401, PubMed:35705051, PubMed:37264229, PubMed:9754572). Peptide-bound HLA-E-B2M heterotrimeric complex primarily functions as a ligand for natural killer (NK) cell inhibitory receptor KLRD1-KLRC1, enabling NK cells to monitor the expression of other MHC class I molecules in healthy cells and to tolerate self (PubMed:17179229, PubMed:18083576, PubMed:37264229, PubMed:9486650, PubMed:9754572). Upon cellular stress, preferentially binds signal sequence-derived peptides from stress-induced chaperones and is no longer recognized by NK cell inhibitory receptor KLRD1-KLRC1, resulting in impaired protection from NK cells (PubMed:12461076). Binds signal sequence-derived peptides from non-classical MHC class Ib HLA-G molecules and acts as a ligand for NK cell activating receptor KLRD1-KLRC2, likely playing a role in the generation and effector functions of adaptive NK cells and in maternal-fetal tolerance during pregnancy (PubMed:30134159, PubMed:37264229, PubMed:9754572). Besides self-peptides, can also bind and present pathogen-derived peptides conformationally similar to VL9 peptides to alpha-beta T cell receptor (TCR) on unconventional CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells, ultimately triggering antimicrobial immune response (PubMed:16474394, PubMed:20195504, PubMed:30087334, PubMed:34228645). Presents HIV gag peptides (immunodominant KAFSPEVIPMF and subdominant KALGPAATL epitopes) predominantly to CD8-positive T cell clones expressing a TRAV17-containing TCR, triggering HLA-E-restricted T cell responses (PubMed:34228645). Presents mycobacterial peptides to HLA-E-restricted CD8-positive T cells eliciting both cytotoxic and immunoregulatory functions (PubMed:20195504, PubMed:35705051).
