UniprotID	P49918
Accession	P49918
EntryName	CDN1C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57) (p57Kip2)
GeneName	CDKN1C KIP2
Length	316
Function	Potent tight-binding inhibitor of several G1 cyclin/CDK complexes (cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin D2-CDK4, and cyclin A-CDK2) and, to lesser extent, of the mitotic cyclin B-CDC2. Negative regulator of cell proliferation. May play a role in maintenance of the non-proliferative state throughout life.
