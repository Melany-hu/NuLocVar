Accession	Q7L2H7;A8K7X4;B4E2Q4;O60735;Q2F836;Q53HL6;Q9BXW1
EntryName	EIF3M_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit M (eIF3m) (Fetal lung protein B5) (hFL-B5) (PCI domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	EIF3M HFLB5 PCID1 GA17 PNAS-125
Length	242
Function	Component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, which is required for several steps in the initiation of protein synthesis (PubMed:17403899, PubMed:25849773, PubMed:27462815). The eIF-3 complex associates with the 40S ribosome and facilitates the recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A, eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation (PubMed:17403899). The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression (PubMed:25849773).
