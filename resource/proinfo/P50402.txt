ProteinName	Emerin
GeneName	EMD EDMD STA
Length	254
Function	Stabilizes and promotes the formation of a nuclear actin cortical network. Stimulates actin polymerization in vitro by binding and stabilizing the pointed end of growing filaments. Inhibits beta-catenin activity by preventing its accumulation in the nucleus. Acts by influencing the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin through a CRM1-dependent export pathway. Links centrosomes to the nuclear envelope via a microtubule association. Required for proper localization of non-farnesylated prelamin-A/C. Together with NEMP1, contributes to nuclear envelope stiffness in germ cells (PubMed:32923640). EMD and BAF are cooperative cofactors of HIV-1 infection. Association of EMD with the viral DNA requires the presence of BAF and viral integrase. The association of viral DNA with chromatin requires the presence of BAF and EMD.
