ProteinName	T-box transcription factor TBX21 (T-box protein 21) (T-cell-specific T-box transcription factor T-bet) (Transcription factor TBLYM)
GeneName	TBX21 TBET TBLYM
Length	535
Function	Lineage-defining transcription factor which initiates Th1 lineage development from naive Th precursor cells both by activating Th1 genetic programs and by repressing the opposing Th2 and Th17 genetic programs (PubMed:10761931). Activates transcription of a set of genes important for Th1 cell function, including those encoding IFN-gamma and the chemokine receptor CXCR3. Induces permissive chromatin accessibilty and CpG methylation in IFNG (PubMed:33296702). Activates IFNG and CXCR3 genes in part by recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes including KDM6B, a SMARCA4-containing SWI/SNF-complex, and an H3K4me2-methyltransferase complex to their promoters and all of these complexes serve to establish a more permissive chromatin state conducive with transcriptional activation (By similarity). Can activate Th1 genes also via recruitment of Mediator complex and P-TEFb (composed of CDK9 and CCNT1/cyclin-T1) in the form of the super elongation complex (SEC) to super-enhancers and associated genes in activated Th1 cells (PubMed:27292648). Inhibits the Th17 cell lineage commitment by blocking RUNX1-mediated transactivation of Th17 cell-specific transcriptinal regulator RORC. Inhibits the Th2 cell lineage commitment by suppressing the production of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL- 13, via repression of transcriptional regulators GATA3 and NFATC2. Protects Th1 cells from amplifying aberrant type-I IFN response in an IFN-gamma abundant microenvironment by acting as a repressor of type-I IFN transcription factors and type-I IFN-stimulated genes. Acts as a regulator of antiviral B-cell responses; controls chronic viral infection by promoting the antiviral antibody IgG2a isotype switching and via regulation of a broad antiviral gene expression program (By similarity). Required for the correct development of natural killer (NK) and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells (PubMed:33296702).
