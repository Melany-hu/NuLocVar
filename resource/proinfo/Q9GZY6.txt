UniprotID	Q9GZY6
Accession	Q9GZY6;A6NFK6;A8K209;A8K4F1;D3DXF9;Q9BXX8;Q9NZY9
EntryName	NTAL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Linker for activation of T-cells family member 2 (Linker for activation of B-cells) (Membrane-associated adapter molecule) (Non-T-cell activation linker) (Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosomal region 15 protein) (Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosomal region 5 protein)
GeneName	LAT2 LAB NTAL WBS15 WBSCR15 WBSCR5 HSPC046
Length	243
Function	Involved in FCER1 (high affinity immunoglobulin epsilon receptor)-mediated signaling in mast cells. May also be involved in BCR (B-cell antigen receptor)-mediated signaling in B-cells and FCGR1 (high affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc receptor I)-mediated signaling in myeloid cells. Couples activation of these receptors and their associated kinases with distal intracellular events through the recruitment of GRB2.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
