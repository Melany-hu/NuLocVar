UniprotID	Q5TEU4
Accession	Q5TEU4;A8K166;Q6GPH3;Q9H6F4
EntryName	NDUF5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Arginine-hydroxylase NDUFAF5, mitochondrial (EC 1.-.-.-) (NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex assembly factor 5) (Putative methyltransferase NDUFAF5) (EC 2.1.1.-)
GeneName	NDUFAF5 C20orf7
Length	345
Function	Arginine hydroxylase that mediates hydroxylation of 'Arg-111' of NDUFS7 and is involved in the assembly of mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (complex I, MT-ND1) at early stages (PubMed:18940309, PubMed:27226634). May also have methyltransferase activity (Probable).
