Function	Functional component of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) for misfolded lumenal proteins (PubMed:15215856, PubMed:33658201). Forms homotetramers which encircle a large channel traversing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (PubMed:33658201). This allows the retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins from the ER into the cytosol where they are ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (PubMed:33658201). The channel has a lateral gate within the membrane which provides direct access to membrane proteins with no need to reenter the ER lumen first (PubMed:33658201). May mediate the interaction between VCP and the misfolded protein (PubMed:15215856). Also involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced pre-emptive quality control, a mechanism that selectively attenuates the translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and reroutes them to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (PubMed:26565908). By controlling the steady-state expression of the IGF1R receptor, indirectly regulates the insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway (PubMed:26692333).
