UniprotID	Q6PI25
Accession	Q6PI25
EntryName	CNIH2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein cornichon homolog 2 (CNIH-2) (Cornichon family AMPA receptor auxiliary protein 2) (Cornichon-like protein)
GeneName	CNIH2 CNIL
Length	160
Function	Regulates the trafficking and gating properties of AMPA-selective glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Promotes their targeting to the cell membrane and synapses and modulates their gating properties by regulating their rates of activation, deactivation and desensitization. Blocks CACNG8-mediated resensitization of AMPA receptors.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Postsynaptic cell membrane; Cell projection; Dendrite; Cell projection; Dendritic spine; Postsynaptic density
