UniprotID	X6R8P6
Accession	X6R8P6
EntryName	X6R8P6_HUMAN
ProteinName	SOSS complex subunit C (SOSS-C) (SSB-interacting protein 1) (Sensor of single-strand DNA complex subunit C) (Sensor of ssDNA subunit C) (Single-stranded DNA-binding protein-interacting protein 1)
GeneName	INIP
Length	74
Function	Component of the SOSS complex, a multiprotein complex that functions downstream of the MRN complex to promote DNA repair and G2/M checkpoint. The SOSS complex associates with single-stranded DNA at DNA lesions and influences diverse endpoints in the cellular DNA damage response including cell-cycle checkpoint activation, recombinational repair and maintenance of genomic stability. Required for efficient homologous recombination-dependent repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs).
