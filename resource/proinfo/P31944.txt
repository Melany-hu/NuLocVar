UniprotID	P31944
Accession	P31944;O95823;Q3SYC9
EntryName	CASPE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caspase-14 (CASP-14) (EC 3.4.22.-) [Cleaved into: Caspase-14 subunit p17, mature form; Caspase-14 subunit p10, mature form; Caspase-14 subunit p20, intermediate form; Caspase-14 subunit p8, intermediate form]
GeneName	CASP14
Length	242
Function	Non-apoptotic caspase involved in epidermal differentiation. Is the predominant caspase in epidermal stratum corneum (PubMed:15556625). Seems to play a role in keratinocyte differentiation and is required for cornification. Regulates maturation of the epidermis by proteolytically processing filaggrin (By similarity). In vitro has a preference for the substrate -X-X-D motif and is active on the synthetic caspase substrate WEHD-ACF (PubMed:16854378, PubMed:19960512). Involved in processing of prosaposin in the epidermis (By similarity). May be involved in retinal pigment epithelium cell barrier function (PubMed:25121097). Involved in DNA degradation in differentiated keratinocytes probably by cleaving DFFA/ICAD leading to liberation of DFFB/CAD (PubMed:24743736).
