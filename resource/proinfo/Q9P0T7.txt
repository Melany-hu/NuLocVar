UniprotID	Q9P0T7
Accession	Q9P0T7;B1ALM6;Q96NQ9;Q9BQF5
EntryName	TMEM9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proton-transporting V-type ATPase complex assembly regulator TMEM9 (v-ATPase assembly regulator TMEM9) (Dermal papilla-derived protein 4) (Transmembrane protein 9) (Protein TMEM9)
GeneName	TMEM9 DERP4 TMEM9A HSPC186 PSEC0012 UNQ631/PRO1248
Length	183
Function	Transmembrane protein that binds to and facilitates the assembly of lysosomal proton-transporting V-type ATPase (v-ATPase), resulting in enhanced lysosomal acidification and trafficking (PubMed:30374053). By bringing the v-ATPase accessory protein ATP6AP2 and the v-ATPase subunit ATP6V0D1 together, allows v-ATPase complex formation and activation (PubMed:30374053). TMEM9-controlled vesicular acidification induces hyperactivation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, involved in development, tissue homeostasis and tissue regeneration, through lysosomal degradation of adenomatous polyposis coli/APC (PubMed:30374053, PubMed:32380568). In the liver, involved in hepatic regeneration (PubMed:32380568).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane; Late endosome membrane; Endosome; Multivesicular body membrane
