UniprotID	Q6P3W2
Accession	Q6P3W2;A8K0V0;B1ALC1;I6L9B4
EntryName	DJC24_HUMAN
ProteinName	DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 24 (CSL-type zinc finger-containing protein 3) (Diphthamide biosynthesis protein 4)
GeneName	DNAJC24 DPH4 ZCSL3
Length	149
Function	Stimulates the ATPase activity of several Hsp70-type chaperones. This ability is enhanced by iron-binding. The iron-bound form is redox-active and can function as electron carrier. Plays a role in the diphthamide biosynthesis, a post-translational modification of histidine which occurs in translation elongation factor 2 (EEF2) which can be ADP-ribosylated by diphtheria toxin and by Pseudomonas exotoxin A (Eta).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
