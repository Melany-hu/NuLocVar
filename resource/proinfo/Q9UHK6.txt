EntryName	AMACR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (EC 5.1.99.4) (2-methylacyl-CoA racemase)
GeneName	AMACR
Length	382
Function	Catalyzes the interconversion of (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers of alpha-methyl-branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA esters (PubMed:10655068, PubMed:11060359, PubMed:7649182). Acts only on coenzyme A thioesters, not on free fatty acids, and accepts as substrates a wide range of alpha-methylacyl-CoAs, including pristanoyl-CoA, trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA (an intermediate in bile acid synthesis), and arylpropionic acids like the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid) but neither 3-methyl-branched nor linear-chain acyl-CoAs (PubMed:10655068, PubMed:11060359, PubMed:7649182).
