EntryName	APBB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Amyloid beta precursor protein binding family B member 1 (Amyloid-beta A4 precursor protein-binding family B member 1) (Protein Fe65)
GeneName	APBB1 FE65 RIR
Length	710
Function	Transcription coregulator that can have both coactivator and corepressor functions (PubMed:15031292, PubMed:18468999, PubMed:18922798, PubMed:25342469, PubMed:33938178). Adapter protein that forms a transcriptionally active complex with the gamma-secretase-derived amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (PubMed:15031292, PubMed:18468999, PubMed:18922798, PubMed:25342469). Plays a central role in the response to DNA damage by translocating to the nucleus and inducing apoptosis (PubMed:15031292, PubMed:18468999, PubMed:18922798, PubMed:25342469). May act by specifically recognizing and binding histone H2AX phosphorylated on 'Tyr-142' (H2AXY142ph) at double-strand breaks (DSBs), recruiting other pro-apoptosis factors such as MAPK8/JNK1 (PubMed:19234442). Required for histone H4 acetylation at double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:19234442). Its ability to specifically bind modified histones and chromatin modifying enzymes such as KAT5/TIP60, probably explains its transcription activation activity (PubMed:33938178). Functions in association with TSHZ3, SET and HDAC factors as a transcriptional repressor, that inhibits the expression of CASP4 (PubMed:19343227). Associates with chromatin in a region surrounding the CASP4 transcriptional start site(s) (PubMed:19343227). Involved in hippocampal neurite branching and neuromuscular junction formation, as a result plays a role in spatial memory functioning (By similarity). Plays a role in the maintenance of lens transparency (By similarity). May play a role in muscle cell strength (By similarity). Acts as a molecular adapter that functions in neurite outgrowth by activating the RAC1-ARF6 axis upon insulin treatment (PubMed:36250347).
