EntryName	SIA8D_HUMAN
ProteinName	CMP-N-acetylneuraminate-poly-alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.3.-) (Alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 8D) (Polysialyltransferase) (Polysialyltransferase-1) (Sialyltransferase 8D) (SIAT8-D) (Sialyltransferase St8Sia IV) (ST8SiaIV)
GeneName	ST8SIA4 PST PST1 SIAT8D
Length	359
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of a sialic acid from a CMP-linked sialic acid donor onto a terminal alpha-2,3-, alpha-2,6-, or alpha-2,8-linked sialic acid of an N-linked glycan protein acceptor through alpha-2,8-linkages (PubMed:10766765, PubMed:11279095, PubMed:28810663, PubMed:9774483). Therefore, participates in polysialic acid synthesis on various sialylated N-acetyllactosaminyl oligosaccharides, including NCAM1 N-glycans, FETUB N-glycans and AHSG (PubMed:10766765, PubMed:11279095, PubMed:28810663, PubMed:9774483). It is noteworthy that alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid is apparently a better acceptor than alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid (PubMed:9774483).
