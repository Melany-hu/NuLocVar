UniprotID	P58876
Accession	P58876
EntryName	H2B1D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type 1-D (H2B-clustered histone 5) (HIRA-interacting protein 2) (Histone H2B.1 B) (Histone H2B.b) (H2B/b)
GeneName	H2BC5 H2BFB HIRIP2 HIST1H2BD
Length	126
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
