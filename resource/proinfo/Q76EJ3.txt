UniprotID	Q76EJ3
Accession	Q76EJ3;O95454;Q498C1;Q75W21;Q7Z5X5
EntryName	S35D2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleotide sugar transporter SLC35D2 (Homolog of Fringe connection protein 1) (HFRC1) (SQV7-like protein) (SQV7L) (Solute carrier family 35 member D2) (UDP-galactose transporter-related protein 8) (UGTrel8)
GeneName	SLC35D2 HFRC UGTREL8
Length	337
Function	Nucleotide sugar antiporter transporting UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) from the cytosol into the lumen of the Golgi in exchange of UMP. By supplying UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, a donor substrate to heparan sulfate synthases, probably takes part in the synthesis of these glycoconjugates.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
