Accession	Q9H019;A6NCB4;B7WNV5;D3DPJ4;Q63HP1;Q7Z2S7;Q9NUI7
EntryName	MFR1L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial fission regulator 1-like
GeneName	MTFR1L FAM54B HYST1888 MSTP116
Length	292
Function	Mitochondrial protein required for adaptation of miochondrial dynamics to metabolic changes. Regulates mitochondrial morphology at steady state and mediates AMPK-dependent stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation via the control of OPA1 levels.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane
