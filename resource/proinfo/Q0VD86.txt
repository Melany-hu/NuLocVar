UniprotID	Q0VD86
Accession	Q0VD86;Q6J273;Q6PKN9
EntryName	INCA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein INCA1 (Inhibitor of CDK interacting with cyclin A1)
GeneName	INCA1 HSD45
Length	236
Function	Binds to CDK2-bound cyclins and inhibits the kinase activity of CDK2; binding to cyclins is critical for its function as CDK inhibitor (PubMed:21540187). Inhibits cell growth and cell proliferation and may play a role in cell cycle control (By similarity). Required for ING5-mediated regulation of S-phase progression, enhancement of Fas-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm
