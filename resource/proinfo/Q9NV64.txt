EntryName	TM39A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 39A
GeneName	TMEM39A SUSR2
Length	488
Function	Regulates autophagy by controlling the spatial distribution and levels of the intracellular phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) pools (PubMed:31806350). Modulates (PtdIns(4)P) levels by regulating the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of the phosphatidylinositide phosphatase SACM1L (PubMed:31806350).
