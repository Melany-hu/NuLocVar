UniprotID	Q9NS84
Accession	Q9NS84;O75667
EntryName	CHST7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 7 (EC 2.8.2.-) (EC 2.8.2.17) (Chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase 2) (C6ST-2) (Galactose/N-acetylglucosamine/N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase 5) (GST-5) (N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase 4) (GlcNAc6ST-4) (Gn6st-4)
GeneName	CHST7
Length	486
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) as sulfonate donor to catalyze the transfer of sulfate to position 6 of non-reducing N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. Preferentially acts on mannose-linked GlcNAc. Also able to catalyze the transfer of sulfate to position 6 of the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue of chondroitin. Also acts on core 2 mucin-type oligosaccharide and N-acetyllactosamine oligomer with a lower efficiency. Has weak or no activity toward keratan sulfate and oligosaccharides containing the Galbeta1-4GlcNAc. Catalyzes 6-O-sulfation of beta-benzyl GlcNAc but not alpha- or beta-benzyl GalNAc.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
