UniprotID	Q86UY5
Accession	Q86UY5;Q71HL2;Q8N7I1;Q96I47
EntryName	FA83A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein FAM83A (Tumor antigen BJ-TSA-9) (Tumor-specific gene expressed in prostate protein)
GeneName	FAM83A TSGP
Length	434
Function	Probable proto-oncogene that functions in the epidermal growth factor receptor/EGFR signaling pathway. Activates both RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/TOR signaling cascades downstream of EGFR. Required for the RAS/MAPK signaling cascade activation upon EGFR stimulation, it also activates both signaling cascades independently of EGFR activation.
