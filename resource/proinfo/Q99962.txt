UniprotID	Q99962
Accession	Q99962;B2R618;Q9NQK5
EntryName	SH3G2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endophilin-A1 (EEN-B1) (Endophilin-1) (SH3 domain protein 2A) (SH3 domain-containing GRB2-like protein 2)
GeneName	SH3GL2 CNSA2 SH3D2A
Length	352
Function	Implicated in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. May recruit other proteins to membranes with high curvature. Required for BDNF-dependent dendrite outgrowth. Cooperates with SH3GL2 to mediate BDNF-NTRK2 early endocytic trafficking and signaling from early endosomes.
