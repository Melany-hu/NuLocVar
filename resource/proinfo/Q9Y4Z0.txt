UniprotID	Q9Y4Z0
Accession	Q9Y4Z0
EntryName	LSM4_HUMAN
ProteinName	U6 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein LSm4 (Glycine-rich protein) (GRP)
GeneName	LSM4
Length	139
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing as component of the U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP complex that is involved in spliceosome assembly, and as component of the precatalytic spliceosome (spliceosome B complex) (PubMed:28781166). The heptameric LSM2-8 complex binds specifically to the 3'-terminal U-tract of U6 snRNA (PubMed:10523320).
