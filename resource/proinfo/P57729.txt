UniprotID	P57729
Accession	P57729;Q53XK7
EntryName	RAB38_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-38 (EC 3.6.5.2) (Melanoma antigen NY-MEL-1)
GeneName	RAB38
Length	211
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (By similarity). RAB38 may be involved in melanosomal transport and docking. Involved in the proper sorting of TYRP1. Involved in peripheral melanosomal distribution of TYRP1 in melanocytes; the function, which probably is implicating vesicle-trafficking, includes cooperation with ANKRD27 and VAMP7 (By similarity). Plays a role in the maturation of phagosomes that engulf pathogens, such as S.aureus and M.tuberculosis (PubMed:21255211). Plays an important role in the control of melanin production and melanosome biogenesis (PubMed:23084991). In concert with RAB32, regulates the proper trafficking of melanogenic enzymes TYR, TYRP1 and DCT/TYRP2 to melanosomes in melanocytes (By similarity).
