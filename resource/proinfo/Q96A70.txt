EntryName	AZIN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Antizyme inhibitor 2 (AzI2) (Arginine decarboxylase) (ADC) (ARGDC) (Ornithine decarboxylase-like protein) (ODC-like protein) (ornithine decarboxylase paralog) (ODC-p)
GeneName	AZIN2 ADC KIAA1945 ODCP
Length	460
Function	Antizyme inhibitor (AZI) protein that positively regulates ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and polyamine uptake. AZI is an enzymatically inactive ODC homolog that counteracts the negative effect of ODC antizymes (AZs) OAZ1, OAZ2 and OAZ3 on ODC activity by competing with ODC for antizyme-binding (PubMed:17900240). Inhibits antizyme-dependent ODC degradation and releases ODC monomers from their inactive complex with antizymes, leading to formation of the catalytically active ODC homodimer and restoring polyamine production (PubMed:17900240). Participates in the morphological integrity of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and functions as a regulator of intracellular secretory vesicle trafficking (PubMed:20188728).
