UniprotID	Q9Y256
Accession	Q9Y256;Q52LZ9
EntryName	FACE2_HUMAN
ProteinName	CAAX prenyl protease 2 (EC 3.4.26.1) (Farnesylated proteins-converting enzyme 2) (FACE-2) (Prenyl protein-specific endoprotease 2) (RCE1 homolog) (hRCE1)
GeneName	RCE1 FACE2 RCE1A RCE1B
Length	329
Function	Protease involved in the processing of a variety of prenylated proteins containing the C-terminal CAAX motif, where C is a cysteine modified with an isoprenoid lipid, A is an aliphatic amino acid and X is any C-terminal amino acid. Proteolytically removes the C-terminal three residues of farnesylated and geranylated proteins, leaving the prenylated cysteine as the new C-terminus. Is able to process K-Ras, N-Ras, H-Ras, RAP1B and G-gamma-1 (PubMed:10085068).
