UniprotID	Q86XI6
Accession	Q86XI6;B3KTV3;Q9H812
EntryName	PPR3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3B (Hepatic glycogen-targeting protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit GL) (Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 4) (PP1 subunit R4) (Protein phosphatase 1 subunit GL) (PTG)
GeneName	PPP1R3B PPP1R4
Length	285
Function	Acts as a glycogen-targeting subunit for phosphatase PP1. Facilitates interaction of the PP1 with enzymes of the glycogen metabolism and regulates its activity. Suppresses the rate at which PP1 dephosphorylates (inactivates) glycogen phosphorylase and enhances the rate at which it activates glycogen synthase and therefore limits glycogen breakdown. Its activity is inhibited by PYGL, resulting in inhibition of the glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase phosphatase activities of PP1. Dramatically increases basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis upon overexpression in hepatocytes (By similarity).
