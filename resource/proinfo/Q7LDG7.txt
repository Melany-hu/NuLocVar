UniprotID	Q7LDG7
Accession	Q7LDG7;A6NDC7;O00538;Q9UL65
EntryName	GRP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	RAS guanyl-releasing protein 2 (Calcium and DAG-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor I) (CalDAG-GEFI) (Cdc25-like protein) (hCDC25L) (F25B3.3 kinase-like protein)
GeneName	RASGRP2 CDC25L MCG7
Length	609
Function	Functions as a calcium- and DAG-regulated nucleotide exchange factor specifically activating Rap through the exchange of bound GDP for GTP. May also activate other GTPases such as RRAS, RRAS2, NRAS, KRAS but not HRAS. Functions in aggregation of platelets and adhesion of T-lymphocytes and neutrophils probably through inside-out integrin activation. May function in the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1/CHRM1 signaling pathway.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Cell membrane; Synapse; Synaptosome; Cell projection; Ruffle membrane
