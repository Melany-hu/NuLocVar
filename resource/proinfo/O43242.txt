UniprotID	O43242
Accession	O43242;B3KMW9;B4DT72;Q96EI2;Q9BQA4
EntryName	PSMD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 3 (26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN3) (26S proteasome regulatory subunit S3) (Proteasome subunit p58)
GeneName	PSMD3
Length	534
Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair.
