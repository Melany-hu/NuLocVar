UniprotID	P49674
Accession	P49674
EntryName	KC1E_HUMAN
ProteinName	Casein kinase I isoform epsilon (CKI-epsilon) (CKIe) (EC 2.7.11.1)
GeneName	CSNK1E
Length	416
Function	Casein kinases are operationally defined by their preferential utilization of acidic proteins such as caseins as substrates (Probable). Participates in Wnt signaling (PubMed:12556519, PubMed:23413191). Phosphorylates DVL1 (PubMed:12556519). Phosphorylates DVL2 (PubMed:23413191). Phosphorylates NEDD9/HEF1 (By similarity). Central component of the circadian clock (PubMed:16790549). In balance with PP1, determines the circadian period length, through the regulation of the speed and rhythmicity of PER1 and PER2 phosphorylation (PubMed:15917222, PubMed:16790549). Controls PER1 and PER2 nuclear transport and degradation (By similarity). Inhibits cytokine-induced granuloytic differentiation (PubMed:15070676).
