UniprotID	P39900
Accession	P39900;B2R9X8;B7ZLF6;Q2M1L9
EntryName	MMP12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Macrophage metalloelastase (MME) (EC 3.4.24.65) (Macrophage elastase) (ME) (hME) (Matrix metalloproteinase-12) (MMP-12)
GeneName	MMP12 HME
Length	470
Function	May be involved in tissue injury and remodeling. Has significant elastolytic activity. Can accept large and small amino acids at the P1' site, but has a preference for leucine. Aromatic or hydrophobic residues are preferred at the P1 site, with small hydrophobic residues (preferably alanine) occupying P3.
