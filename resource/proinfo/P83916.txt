UniprotID	P83916
Accession	P83916;P23197
EntryName	CBX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chromobox protein homolog 1 (HP1Hsbeta) (Heterochromatin protein 1 homolog beta) (HP1 beta) (Heterochromatin protein p25) (M31) (Modifier 1 protein) (p25beta)
GeneName	CBX1 CBX
Length	185
Function	Component of heterochromatin. Recognizes and binds histone H3 tails methylated at 'Lys-9', leading to epigenetic repression. Interaction with lamin B receptor (LBR) can contribute to the association of the heterochromatin with the inner nuclear membrane.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
