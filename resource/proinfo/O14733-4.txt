EntryName	MP2K7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MAP kinase kinase 7) (MAPKK 7) (EC 2.7.12.2) (JNK-activating kinase 2) (MAPK/ERK kinase 7) (MEK 7) (Stress-activated protein kinase kinase 4) (SAPK kinase 4) (SAPKK-4) (SAPKK4) (c-Jun N-terminal kinase kinase 2) (JNK kinase 2) (JNKK 2)

Length	426
Function	Dual specificity protein kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Essential component of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. With MAP2K4/MKK4, is the one of the only known kinase to directly activate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases MAPK8/JNK1, MAPK9/JNK2 and MAPK10/JNK3. MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 both activate the JNKs by phosphorylation, but they differ in their preference for the phosphorylation site in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif. MAP2K4/MKK4 shows preference for phosphorylation of the Tyr residue and MAP2K7/MKK7 for the Thr residue. The monophosphorylation of JNKs on the Thr residue is sufficient to increase JNK activity indicating that MAP2K7/MKK7 is important to trigger JNK activity, while the additional phosphorylation of the Tyr residue by MAP2K4/MKK4 ensures optimal JNK activation. Has a specific role in JNK signal transduction pathway activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. The MKK/JNK signaling pathway is also involved in mitochondrial death signaling pathway, including the release cytochrome c, leading to apoptosis. Part of a non-canonical MAPK signaling pathway, composed of the upstream MAP3K12 kinase and downstream MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1, that enhances the AP-1-mediated transcription of APP in response to APOE (PubMed:28111074).
