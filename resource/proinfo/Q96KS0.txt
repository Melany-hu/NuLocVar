EntryName	EGLN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prolyl hydroxylase EGLN2 (EC 1.14.11.-) (Egl nine homolog 2) (EC 1.14.11.29) (Estrogen-induced tag 6) (EIT-6) (HPH-3) (Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase 1) (HIF-PH1) (HIF-prolyl hydroxylase 1) (HPH-1) (Prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 1) (PHD1)
GeneName	EGLN2 EIT6
Length	407
Function	Prolyl hydroxylase that mediates hydroxylation of proline residues in target proteins, such as ATF4, IKBKB, CEP192 and HIF1A (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12039559, PubMed:15925519, PubMed:16509823, PubMed:17114296, PubMed:23932902). Target proteins are preferentially recognized via a LXXLAP motif (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12039559, PubMed:15925519). Cellular oxygen sensor that catalyzes, under normoxic conditions, the post-translational formation of 4-hydroxyproline in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha proteins (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12039559, PubMed:12181324, PubMed:15925519, PubMed:19339211). Hydroxylates a specific proline found in each of the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domains (N-terminal, NODD, and C-terminal, CODD) of HIF1A (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12039559, PubMed:12181324, PubMed:15925519). Also hydroxylates HIF2A (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12039559, PubMed:15925519). Has a preference for the CODD site for both HIF1A and HIF2A (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12039559, PubMed:15925519). Hydroxylated HIFs are then targeted for proteasomal degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitination complex (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12039559, PubMed:15925519). Under hypoxic conditions, the hydroxylation reaction is attenuated allowing HIFs to escape degradation resulting in their translocation to the nucleus, heterodimerization with HIF1B, and increased expression of hypoxy-inducible genes (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12039559, PubMed:15925519). EGLN2 is involved in regulating hypoxia tolerance and apoptosis in cardiac and skeletal muscle (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12039559, PubMed:15925519). Also regulates susceptibility to normoxic oxidative neuronal death (PubMed:11595184, PubMed:12039559, PubMed:15925519). Links oxygen sensing to cell cycle and primary cilia formation by hydroxylating the critical centrosome component CEP192 which promotes its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:23932902). Hydroxylates IKBKB, mediating NF-kappa-B activation in hypoxic conditions (PubMed:17114296). Also mediates hydroxylation of ATF4, leading to decreased protein stability of ATF4 (By similarity).
