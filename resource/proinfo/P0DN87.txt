EntryName	CGB7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Choriogonadotropin subunit beta 7
GeneName	CGB7
Length	165
Function	Beta subunit of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG is a complex glycoprotein composed of two glycosylated subunits alpha and beta which are non-covalently associated. The alpha subunit is identical to those in the pituitary gonadotropin hormones (LH, FSH and TSH). The beta subunits are distinct in each of the hormones and confer receptor and biological specificity. Has an essential role for pregnancy and maternal adaptation. Stimulates the ovaries to synthesize the steroids that are essential for the maintenance of pregnancy.
