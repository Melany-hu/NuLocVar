EntryName	TFDP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor Dp-2 (E2F dimerization partner 2)
GeneName	TFDP2 DP2
Length	446
Function	Can stimulate E2F-dependent transcription. Binds DNA cooperatively with E2F family members through the E2 recognition site, 5'-TTTCCGC-3', found in the promoter region of a number of genes whose products are involved in cell cycle regulation or in DNA replication. The TFDP2:E2F complex functions in the control of cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase. The E2F1:DP complex appears to mediate both cell proliferation and apoptosis. Blocks adipocyte differentiation by repressing CEBPA binding to its target gene promoters (PubMed:20176812).
