UniprotID	Q8TB68
Accession	Q8TB68;Q8WU53;Q9BTA7
EntryName	PRR7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proline-rich protein 7 (Synaptic proline-rich membrane protein)
GeneName	PRR7
Length	274
Function	Acts as a synapse-to-nucleus messenger to promote NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in neurons in a JUN-dependent manner (By similarity). Inhibits ubiquitination-mediated degradation and promotes phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of transcription factor JUN (PubMed:27458189). Might play a redundant role in the regulation of T cell receptor signaling (PubMed:21460222). Might promote apoptosis in T cells (PubMed:21460222).
