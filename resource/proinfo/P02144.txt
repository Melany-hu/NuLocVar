UniprotID	P02144
Accession	P02144;Q52H51;Q5THY7
EntryName	MYG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myoglobin (Nitrite reductase MB) (EC 1.7.-.-) (Pseudoperoxidase MB) (EC 1.11.1.-)
GeneName	MB
Length	154
Function	Monomeric heme protein which primary function is to store oxygen and facilitate its diffusion within muscle tissues. Reversibly binds oxygen through a pentacoordinated heme iron and enables its timely and efficient release as needed during periods of heightened demand (PubMed:30918256, PubMed:34679218). Depending on the oxidative conditions of tissues and cells, and in addition to its ability to bind oxygen, it also has a nitrite reductase activity whereby it regulates the production of bioactive nitric oxide (PubMed:32891753). Under stress conditions, like hypoxia and anoxia, it also protects cells against reactive oxygen species thanks to its pseudoperoxidase activity (PubMed:34679218).
