UniprotID	Q6IN84
Accession	Q6IN84;A8K8E2;Q96GK2;Q9H664
EntryName	MRM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	rRNA methyltransferase 1, mitochondrial (EC 2.1.1.-) (16S rRNA (guanosine(1145)-2'-O)-methyltransferase) (16S rRNA [Gm1145] 2'-O-methyltransferase)
GeneName	MRM1
Length	353
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of 2'-O-methylguanosine at position 1145 (Gm1145) in the 16S mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSU rRNA), a universally conserved modification in the peptidyl transferase domain of the mtLSU rRNA.
