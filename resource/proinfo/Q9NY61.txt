UniprotID	Q9NY61
Accession	Q9NY61;A6NCJ6;B3KQ26;Q9P0A4;Q9UNX5
EntryName	AATF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein AATF (Apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor) (Rb-binding protein Che-1)
GeneName	AATF CHE1 DED HSPC277
Length	560
Function	Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797). May function as a general inhibitor of the histone deacetylase HDAC1. Binding to the pocket region of RB1 may displace HDAC1 from RB1/E2F complexes, leading to activation of E2F target genes and cell cycle progression. Conversely, displacement of HDAC1 from SP1 bound to the CDKN1A promoter leads to increased expression of this CDK inhibitor and blocks cell cycle progression. Also antagonizes PAWR mediated induction of aberrant amyloid peptide production in Alzheimer disease (presenile and senile dementia), although the molecular basis for this phenomenon has not been described to date.
