UniprotID	Q13702
Accession	Q13702;Q8TDF3;Q9BTD9
EntryName	RAPSN_HUMAN
ProteinName	43 kDa receptor-associated protein of the synapse (RAPsyn) (43 kDa postsynaptic protein) (Acetylcholine receptor-associated 43 kDa protein) (RING finger protein 205)
GeneName	RAPSN RNF205
Length	412
Function	Postsynaptic protein required for clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. It may link the receptor to the underlying postsynaptic cytoskeleton, possibly by direct association with actin or spectrin.
