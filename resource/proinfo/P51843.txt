UniprotID	P51843
Accession	P51843;Q96F69
EntryName	NR0B1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear receptor subfamily 0 group B member 1 (DSS-AHC critical region on the X chromosome protein 1) (Nuclear receptor DAX-1)
GeneName	NR0B1 AHC DAX1
Length	470
Function	Nuclear receptor that lacks a DNA-binding domain and acts as a corepressor that inhibits the transcriptional activity of other nuclear receptors through heterodimeric interactions (PubMed:12482977, PubMed:32433991). Component of a cascade required for the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-gonadal axis (PubMed:7990953, PubMed:8675564). May also have a role in the development of the embryo and in the maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency (By similarity).
