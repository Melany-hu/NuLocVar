UniprotID	O43586-2
Accession	O43586;B5BU74;B5BUK4;O43585;O95657
EntryName	PPIP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PEST phosphatase-interacting protein 1) (CD2-binding protein 1) (H-PIP)
GeneName	PSTPIP1 CD2BP1
Length	397
Function	Involved in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. May regulate WAS actin-bundling activity. Bridges the interaction between ABL1 and PTPN18 leading to ABL1 dephosphorylation. May play a role as a scaffold protein between PTPN12 and WAS and allow PTPN12 to dephosphorylate WAS. Has the potential to physically couple CD2 and CD2AP to WAS. Acts downstream of CD2 and CD2AP to recruit WAS to the T-cell:APC contact site so as to promote the actin polymerization required for synapse induction during T-cell activation (By similarity). Down-regulates CD2-stimulated adhesion through the coupling of PTPN12 to CD2. Also has a role in innate immunity and the inflammatory response. Recruited to inflammasomes by MEFV. Induces formation of pyroptosomes, large supramolecular structures composed of oligomerized PYCARD dimers which form prior to inflammatory apoptosis. Binding to MEFV allows MEFV to bind to PYCARD and facilitates pyroptosome formation. Regulates endocytosis and cell migration in neutrophils.
