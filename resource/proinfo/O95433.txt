UniprotID	O95433
Accession	O95433;B2R9L2;B4DUR9;Q96IL6;Q9P060
EntryName	AHSA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Activator of 90 kDa heat shock protein ATPase homolog 1 (AHA1) (p38)
GeneName	AHSA1 C14orf3 HSPC322
Length	338
Function	Acts as a co-chaperone of HSP90AA1 (PubMed:29127155). Activates the ATPase activity of HSP90AA1 leading to increase in its chaperone activity (PubMed:29127155). Competes with the inhibitory co-chaperone FNIP1 for binding to HSP90AA1, thereby providing a reciprocal regulatory mechanism for chaperoning of client proteins (PubMed:27353360). Competes with the inhibitory co-chaperone TSC1 for binding to HSP90AA1, thereby providing a reciprocal regulatory mechanism for chaperoning of client proteins (PubMed:29127155).
