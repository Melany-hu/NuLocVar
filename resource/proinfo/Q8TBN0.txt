UniprotID	Q8TBN0
Accession	Q8TBN0;Q86V32;Q9P1Q8
EntryName	R3GEF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab-3A (Rab-3A-interacting-like protein 1) (Rab3A-interacting-like protein 1) (Rabin3-like 1)
GeneName	RAB3IL1
Length	382
Function	Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which may activate RAB3A, a GTPase that regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Promotes the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting inactive GDP-bound Rab proteins into their active GTP-bound form. May also activate RAB8A and RAB8B.
