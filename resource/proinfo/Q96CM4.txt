UniprotID	Q96CM4
Accession	Q96CM4;Q0QD37
EntryName	NXNL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleoredoxin-like protein 1 (Thioredoxin-like protein 6)
GeneName	NXNL1 TXNL6
Length	212
Function	Plays an important role in retinal cone photoreceptor survival (PubMed:25957687). In association with glucose transporter SLC16A1/GLUT1 and BSG, promotes retinal cone survival by enhancing aerobic glycolysis and accelerating the entry of glucose into photoreceptors (PubMed:25957687). May play a role in cone cell viability, slowing down cone degeneration, does not seem to play a role in degenerating rods (By similarity).
