EntryName	CP24A_HUMAN
ProteinName	1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) 24-hydroxylase, mitochondrial (24-OHase) (Vitamin D(3) 24-hydroxylase) (EC 1.14.15.16) (Cytochrome P450 24A1) (Cytochrome P450-CC24)
GeneName	CYP24A1 CYP24
Length	514
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase with a key role in vitamin D catabolism and calcium homeostasis. Via C24- and C23-oxidation pathways, catalyzes the inactivation of both the vitamin D precursor calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D(3)) and the active hormone calcitriol (1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)) (PubMed:11012668, PubMed:15574355, PubMed:16617161, PubMed:24893882, PubMed:29461981, PubMed:8679605). With initial hydroxylation at C-24 (via C24-oxidation pathway), performs a sequential 6-step oxidation of calcitriol leading to the formation of the biliary metabolite calcitroic acid (PubMed:15574355, PubMed:24893882). With initial hydroxylation at C-23 (via C23-oxidation pathway), catalyzes sequential oxidation of calcidiol leading to the formation of 25(OH)D3-26,23-lactone as end product (PubMed:11012668, PubMed:8679605). Preferentially hydroxylates at C-25 other vitamin D active metabolites, such as CYP11A1-derived secosteroids 20S-hydroxycholecalciferol and 20S,23-dihydroxycholecalciferol (PubMed:25727742). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via FDXR/adrenodoxin reductase and FDX1/adrenodoxin (PubMed:8679605).
