UniprotID	Q9Y6M9
Accession	Q9Y6M9;B2R8M6;Q9UQE8
EntryName	NDUB9_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 9 (Complex I-B22) (CI-B22) (LYR motif-containing protein 3) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B22 subunit)
GeneName	NDUFB9 LYRM3 UQOR22
Length	179
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed to be not involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
