EntryName	RINI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease inhibitor (Placental ribonuclease inhibitor) (Placental RNase inhibitor) (Ribonuclease/angiogenin inhibitor 1) (RAI)
GeneName	RNH1 PRI RNH
Length	461
Function	Ribonuclease inhibitor which inhibits RNASE1, RNASE2 and angiogenin (ANG) (PubMed:12578357, PubMed:14515218, PubMed:3219362, PubMed:3243277, PubMed:3470787, PubMed:9050852). May play a role in redox homeostasis (PubMed:17292889). Required to inhibit the cytotoxic tRNA ribonuclease activity of ANG in the cytoplasm in absence of stress (PubMed:23843625, PubMed:32510170). Relocates to the nucleus in response to stress, relieving inhibition of ANG in the cytoplasm, and inhibiting the angiogenic activity of ANG in the nucleus (PubMed:23843625).
