ProteinName	Serum paraoxonase/lactonase 3 (EC 3.1.1.2) (EC 3.1.1.81) (EC 3.1.8.1)
GeneName	PON3
Length	354
Function	Has low activity towards the organophosphate paraxon and aromatic carboxylic acid esters. Rapidly hydrolyzes lactones such as statin prodrugs (e.g. lovastatin). Hydrolyzes aromatic lactones and 5- or 6-member ring lactones with aliphatic substituents but not simple lactones or those with polar substituents.
