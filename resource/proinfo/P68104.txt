UniprotID	P68104
Accession	P68104;P04719;P04720;Q6IQ15
EntryName	EF1A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Elongation factor 1-alpha 1 (EF-1-alpha-1) (EC 3.6.5.-) (Elongation factor Tu) (EF-Tu) (Eukaryotic elongation factor 1 A-1) (eEF1A-1) (Leukocyte receptor cluster member 7)
GeneName	EEF1A1 EEF1A EF1A LENG7
Length	462
Function	Translation elongation factor that catalyzes the GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the A-site of ribosomes during the elongation phase of protein synthesis (PubMed:26593721, PubMed:26651998, PubMed:36123449, PubMed:36264623, PubMed:36638793). Base pairing between the mRNA codon and the aa-tRNA anticodon promotes GTP hydrolysis, releasing the aa-tRNA from EEF1A1 and allowing its accommodation into the ribosome (PubMed:26593721, PubMed:26651998, PubMed:36123449, PubMed:36264623, PubMed:36638793). The growing protein chain is subsequently transferred from the P-site peptidyl tRNA to the A-site aa-tRNA, extending it by one amino acid through ribosome-catalyzed peptide bond formation (PubMed:26593721, PubMed:26651998, PubMed:36123449, PubMed:36264623). Also plays a role in the positive regulation of IFNG transcription in T-helper 1 cells as part of an IFNG promoter-binding complex with TXK and PARP1 (PubMed:17177976).
