UniprotID	P31994
Accession	P31994;A6H8N3;O95649;Q53X85;Q5VXA9;Q8NIA1
EntryName	FCG2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Low affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor II-b (IgG Fc receptor II-b) (CDw32) (Fc-gamma RII-b) (Fc-gamma-RIIb) (FcRII-b) (CD antigen CD32)
GeneName	FCGR2B CD32 FCG2 IGFR2
Length	310
Function	Receptor for the Fc region of complexed or aggregated immunoglobulins gamma. Low affinity receptor. Involved in a variety of effector and regulatory functions such as phagocytosis of immune complexes and modulation of antibody production by B-cells. Binding to this receptor results in down-modulation of previous state of cell activation triggered via antigen receptors on B-cells (BCR), T-cells (TCR) or via another Fc receptor. Isoform IIB1 fails to mediate endocytosis or phagocytosis. Isoform IIB2 does not trigger phagocytosis.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
