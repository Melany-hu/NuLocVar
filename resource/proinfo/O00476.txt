UniprotID	O00476
Accession	O00476;B7WNJ5;B7Z511;Q8WWC7;Q9H533
EntryName	NPT4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 4 (Na(+)/PI cotransporter 4) (NPT4) (Sodium/phosphate cotransporter 4) (Solute carrier family 17 member 3)
GeneName	SLC17A3 NPT4
Length	420
Function	Transports organic anions in a voltage-driven, multispecific, manner, on the apical side of renal proximal tubule (PubMed:20810651). In particular, participates in the secretion of urate from the cell into the lumen (PubMed:20810651). Urate is the end product of purine metabolism (PubMed:20810651). May have roles in the metabolism and secretion of estrone sulfate, estradiol-17-beta-glucuronide, ochratoxin A, as wells as drugs such as bumetanide (PubMed:20810651).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Cell membrane
