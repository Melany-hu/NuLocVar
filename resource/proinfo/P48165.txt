GeneName	GJA8
Length	433
Function	Structural component of eye lens gap junctions (PubMed:18006672, PubMed:19756179). Gap junctions are dodecameric channels that connect the cytoplasm of adjoining cells. They are formed by the docking of two hexameric hemichannels, one from each cell membrane (By similarity). Small molecules and ions diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell via the central pore (PubMed:18006672, PubMed:19756179).
