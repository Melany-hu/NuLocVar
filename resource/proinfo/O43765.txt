EntryName	SGTA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha (Alpha-SGT) (Vpu-binding protein) (UBP)
GeneName	SGTA SGT SGT1
Length	313
Function	Co-chaperone that binds misfolded and hydrophobic patches-containing client proteins in the cytosol. Mediates their targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum but also regulates their sorting to the proteasome when targeting fails (PubMed:28104892). Functions in tail-anchored/type II transmembrane proteins membrane insertion constituting with ASNA1 and the BAG6 complex a targeting module (PubMed:28104892). Functions upstream of the BAG6 complex and ASNA1, binding more rapidly the transmembrane domain of newly synthesized proteins (PubMed:25535373, PubMed:28104892). It is also involved in the regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated misfolded protein catabolic process via its interaction with BAG6: collaborates with the BAG6 complex to maintain hydrophobic substrates in non-ubiquitinated states (PubMed:23129660, PubMed:25179605). Competes with RNF126 for interaction with BAG6, preventing the ubiquitination of client proteins associated with the BAG6 complex (PubMed:27193484). Binds directly to HSC70 and HSP70 and regulates their ATPase activity (PubMed:18759457).
