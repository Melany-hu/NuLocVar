UniprotID	Q15165
Accession	Q15165;A4D1H7;B2RCP9;B4DJD5;O15114;O15115;O75856;Q5FBX7;Q86YL0
EntryName	PON2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 2 (PON 2) (EC 3.1.1.2) (EC 3.1.1.81) (Aromatic esterase 2) (A-esterase 2) (Serum aryldialkylphosphatase 2)
GeneName	PON2
Length	354
Function	Capable of hydrolyzing lactones and a number of aromatic carboxylic acid esters. Has antioxidant activity. Is not associated with high density lipoprotein. Prevents LDL lipid peroxidation, reverses the oxidation of mildly oxidized LDL, and inhibits the ability of MM-LDL to induce monocyte chemotaxis.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
