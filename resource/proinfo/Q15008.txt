UniprotID	Q15008
Accession	Q15008;A8K2E0;E9PHI9;Q6UV22
EntryName	PSMD6_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 6 (26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN7) (26S proteasome regulatory subunit S10) (Breast cancer-associated protein SGA-113M) (Phosphonoformate immuno-associated protein 4) (Proteasome regulatory particle subunit p44S10) (p42A)
GeneName	PSMD6 KIAA0107 PFAAP4
Length	389
Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair.
