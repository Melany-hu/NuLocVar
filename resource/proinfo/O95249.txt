UniprotID	O95249
Accession	O95249;J3KST5;O75392
EntryName	GOSR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Golgi SNAP receptor complex member 1 (28 kDa Golgi SNARE protein) (28 kDa cis-Golgi SNARE p28) (GOS-28)
GeneName	GOSR1 GS28
Length	250
Function	Involved in transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus as well as in intra-Golgi transport. It belongs to a super-family of proteins called t-SNAREs or soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) attachment protein receptor. May play a protective role against hydrogen peroxide induced cytotoxicity under glutathione depleted conditions in neuronal cells by regulating the intracellular ROS levels via inhibition of p38 MAPK (MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14). Participates in docking and fusion stage of ER to cis-Golgi transport. Plays an important physiological role in VLDL-transport vesicle-Golgi fusion and thus in VLDL delivery to the hepatic cis-Golgi.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
