UniprotID	Q96LR9
Accession	Q96LR9;Q8IVR2;Q9H0I5
EntryName	APLD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Apolipoprotein L domain-containing protein 1 (Vascular early response gene protein)
GeneName	APOLD1 VERGE
Length	279
Function	Is a modulator of endothelial barrier permeability, required for proper organization of endothelial cell-cell junctions and cytoskeleton (PubMed:35638551). It also plays a role in the modulation of secretory autophagy (PubMed:35638551). May affect blood-brain barrier permeability.
