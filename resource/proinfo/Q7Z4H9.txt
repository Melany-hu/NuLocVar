UniprotID	Q7Z4H9
Accession	Q7Z4H9;Q75ML2;Q8NA52;Q9BRR7
EntryName	F220A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein FAM220A (STAT3-interacting protein as a repressor)
GeneName	FAM220A C7orf70 SIPAR
Length	259
Function	Promotes dephosphorylation of transcriptional activator STAT3 by interacting with both STAT3 and protein phosphatase PTPN2. This promotes interaction of PTPN2 with STAT3 and mediates STAT3 dephosphorylation by PTPN2, leading to negative regulation of STAT3 transcriptional activator activity. May be required for spermiogenesis or sperm function.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Acrosome
