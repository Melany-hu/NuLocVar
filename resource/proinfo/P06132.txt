EntryName	DCUP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UPD) (URO-D) (EC 4.1.1.37)
GeneName	UROD
Length	367
Function	Catalyzes the sequential decarboxylation of the four acetate side chains of uroporphyrinogen to form coproporphyrinogen and participates in the fifth step in the heme biosynthetic pathway (PubMed:11069625, PubMed:11719352, PubMed:14633982, PubMed:18004775, PubMed:21668429). Isomer I or isomer III of uroporphyrinogen may serve as substrate, but only coproporphyrinogen III can ultimately be converted to heme (PubMed:11069625, PubMed:11719352, PubMed:14633982, PubMed:21668429). In vitro also decarboxylates pentacarboxylate porphyrinogen I (PubMed:12071824).
