UniprotID	P02775
Accession	P02775;B2R5F3;Q6IBJ8
EntryName	CXCL7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Platelet basic protein (PBP) (C-X-C motif chemokine 7) (Leukocyte-derived growth factor) (LDGF) (Macrophage-derived growth factor) (MDGF) (Small-inducible cytokine B7) [Cleaved into: Connective tissue-activating peptide III (CTAP-III) (LA-PF4) (Low-affinity platelet factor IV); TC-2; Connective tissue-activating peptide III(1-81) (CTAP-III(1-81)); Beta-thromboglobulin (Beta-TG); Neutrophil-activating peptide 2(74) (NAP-2(74)); Neutrophil-activating peptide 2(73) (NAP-2(73)); Neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2); TC-1; Neutrophil-activating peptide 2(1-66) (NAP-2(1-66)); Neutrophil-activating peptide 2(1-63) (NAP-2(1-63))]
GeneName	PPBP CTAP3 CXCL7 SCYB7 TGB1 THBGB1
Length	128
Function	LA-PF4 stimulates DNA synthesis, mitosis, glycolysis, intracellular cAMP accumulation, prostaglandin E2 secretion, and synthesis of hyaluronic acid and sulfated glycosaminoglycan. It also stimulates the formation and secretion of plasminogen activator by human synovial cells. NAP-2 is a ligand for CXCR1 and CXCR2, and NAP-2, NAP-2(73), NAP-2(74), NAP-2(1-66), and most potent NAP-2(1-63) are chemoattractants and activators for neutrophils. TC-1 and TC-2 are antibacterial proteins, in vitro released from activated platelet alpha-granules. CTAP-III(1-81) is more potent than CTAP-III desensitize chemokine-induced neutrophil activation.
