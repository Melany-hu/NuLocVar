UniprotID	Q96A56
Accession	Q96A56;B2RCE5;Q969R9
EntryName	T53I1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor protein p53-inducible nuclear protein 1 (Stress-induced protein) (p53-dependent damage-inducible nuclear protein 1) (p53DINP1)
GeneName	TP53INP1 P53DINP1 SIP
Length	240
Function	Antiproliferative and proapoptotic protein involved in cell stress response which acts as a dual regulator of transcription and autophagy. Acts as a positive regulator of autophagy. In response to cellular stress or activation of autophagy, relocates to autophagosomes where it interacts with autophagosome-associated proteins GABARAP, GABARAPL1/L2, MAP1LC3A/B/C and regulates autophagy. Acts as an antioxidant and plays a major role in p53/TP53-driven oxidative stress response. Possesses both a p53/TP53-independent intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulatory function and a p53/TP53-dependent transcription regulatory function. Positively regulates p53/TP53 and p73/TP73 and stimulates their capacity to induce apoptosis and regulate cell cycle. In response to double-strand DNA breaks, promotes p53/TP53 phosphorylation on 'Ser-46' and subsequent apoptosis. Acts as a tumor suppressor by inducing cell death by an autophagy and caspase-dependent mechanism. Can reduce cell migration by regulating the expression of SPARC.
