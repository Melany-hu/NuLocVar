UniprotID	P49902
Accession	P49902;B7Z382;D3DR91;Q5JUV5
EntryName	5NTC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytosolic purine 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) (EC 3.1.3.99) (Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II) (cN-II) (Cytosolic IMP/GMP-specific 5'-nucleotidase) (Cytosolic nucleoside phosphotransferase 5'N) (EC 2.7.1.77) (High Km 5'-nucleotidase)
GeneName	NT5C2 NT5B NT5CP PNT5
Length	561
Function	Broad specificity cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypurine nucleoside 5'-monophosphates (PubMed:10092873, PubMed:12907246, PubMed:1659319, PubMed:9371705). In addition, possesses a phosphotransferase activity by which it can transfer a phosphate from a donor nucleoside monophosphate to an acceptor nucleoside, preferably inosine, deoxyinosine and guanosine (PubMed:1659319, PubMed:9371705). Has the highest activities for IMP and GMP followed by dIMP, dGMP and XMP (PubMed:10092873, PubMed:12907246, PubMed:1659319, PubMed:9371705). Could also catalyze the transfer of phosphates from pyrimidine monophosphates but with lower efficiency (PubMed:1659319, PubMed:9371705). Through these activities regulates the purine nucleoside/nucleotide pools within the cell (PubMed:10092873, PubMed:12907246, PubMed:1659319, PubMed:9371705).
