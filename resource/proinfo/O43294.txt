UniprotID	O43294
Accession	O43294;B2R8D5;Q9BPW3;Q9Y2V5
EntryName	TGFI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transforming growth factor beta-1-induced transcript 1 protein (Androgen receptor coactivator 55 kDa protein) (Androgen receptor-associated protein of 55 kDa) (Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone 5 protein) (Hic-5)
GeneName	TGFB1I1 ARA55
Length	461
Function	Functions as a molecular adapter coordinating multiple protein-protein interactions at the focal adhesion complex and in the nucleus. Links various intracellular signaling modules to plasma membrane receptors and regulates the Wnt and TGFB signaling pathways. May also regulate SLC6A3 and SLC6A4 targeting to the plasma membrane hence regulating their activity. In the nucleus, functions as a nuclear receptor coactivator regulating glucocorticoid, androgen, mineralocorticoid and progesterone receptor transcriptional activity. May play a role in the processes of cell growth, proliferation, migration, differentiation and senescence. May have a zinc-dependent DNA-binding activity.
Subcellular Location	Cell junction; Focal adhesion; Nucleus matrix; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
