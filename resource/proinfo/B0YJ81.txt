UniprotID	B0YJ81
Accession	B0YJ81;B0YJ80;Q6JIC5;Q96FW7;Q9HB93;Q9UHX2
EntryName	HACD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 1 (EC 4.2.1.134) (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 1) (HACD1) (Cementum-attachment protein) (CAP) (Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-like member A)
GeneName	HACD1 PTPLA
Length	288
Function	Catalyzes the third of the four reactions of the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle. This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process, allows the addition of two carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids/VLCFAs per cycle. This enzyme catalyzes the dehydration of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate into trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA, within each cycle of fatty acid elongation. Thereby, it participates in the production of VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
