UniprotID	Q8NET6
Accession	Q8NET6;Q3SYA3;Q3SYA5
EntryName	CHSTD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 13 (EC 2.8.2.5) (Chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase 3) (Chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase 3) (C4ST-3) (C4ST3)
GeneName	CHST13
Length	341
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of sulfate to position 4 of the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue of chondroitin. Chondroitin sulfate constitutes the predominant proteoglycan present in cartilage and is distributed on the surfaces of many cells and extracellular matrices. Transfers sulfate to the C4 hydroxyl of beta1,4-linked GalNAc that is substituted with a beta-linked glucuronic acid at the C-3 hydroxyl. No activity toward dermatan.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
