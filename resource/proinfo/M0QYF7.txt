UniprotID	M0QYF7
Accession	M0QYF7
EntryName	M0QYF7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosomal protein S19
GeneName	RPS19
Length	100
Function	Component of the small ribosomal subunit. The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell. Required for pre-rRNA processing and maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits. Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome.
