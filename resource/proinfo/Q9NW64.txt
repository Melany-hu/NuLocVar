UniprotID	Q9NW64
Accession	Q9NW64;A6NDM5;B4DLI9;O95607
EntryName	RBM22_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pre-mRNA-splicing factor RBM22 (RNA-binding motif protein 22) (Zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 16)
GeneName	RBM22 ZC3H16 199G4
Length	420
Function	Required for pre-mRNA splicing as component of the activated spliceosome (PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:29301961, PubMed:29360106, PubMed:29361316, PubMed:30705154). Involved in the first step of pre-mRNA splicing. Binds directly to the internal stem-loop (ISL) domain of the U6 snRNA and to the pre-mRNA intron near the 5' splice site during the activation and catalytic phases of the spliceosome cycle. Involved in both translocations of the nuclear SLU7 to the cytoplasm and the cytosolic calcium-binding protein PDCD6 to the nucleus upon cellular stress responses.
