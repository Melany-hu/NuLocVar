UniprotID	Q8N5P1
Accession	Q8N5P1;Q9BZ75
EntryName	ZC3H8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 8
GeneName	ZC3H8 ZC3HDC8
Length	291
Function	Acts as a transcriptional repressor of the GATA3 promoter. Sequence-specific DNA-binding factor that binds to the 5'-AGGTCTC-3' sequence within the negative cis-acting element intronic regulatory region (IRR) of the GATA3 gene (By similarity). Component of the little elongation complex (LEC), a complex required to regulate small nuclear RNA (snRNA) gene transcription by RNA polymerase II and III (PubMed:23932780). Induces thymocyte apoptosis when overexpressed, which may indicate a role in regulation of thymocyte homeostasis.
