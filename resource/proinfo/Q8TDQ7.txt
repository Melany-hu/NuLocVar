EntryName	GNPI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase 2 (GlcN6P deaminase 2) (EC 3.5.99.6) (Glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase 2) (Glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase SB52)
GeneName	GNPDA2 GNP2
Length	276
Function	Catalyzes the reversible conversion of alpha-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN-6P) into beta-D-fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6P) and ammonium ion, a regulatory reaction step in de novo uridine diphosphate-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) biosynthesis via hexosamine pathway. Deamination is coupled to aldo-keto isomerization mediating the metabolic flux from UDP-GlcNAc toward Fru-6P. At high ammonium level can drive amination and isomerization of Fru-6P toward hexosamines and UDP-GlcNAc synthesis. Has a role in fine tuning the metabolic fluctuations of cytosolic UDP-GlcNAc and their effects on hyaluronan synthesis that occur during tissue remodeling.
