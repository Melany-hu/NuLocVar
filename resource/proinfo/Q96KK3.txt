EntryName	KCNS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Delayed-rectifier potassium channel regulatory subunit KCNS1 (Delayed-rectifier K(+) channel alpha subunit 1) (Delayed-rectifier potassium channel subunit Kv9.1) (hKv9.1) (Potassium voltage-gated channel modifier subfamily S member 1)
GeneName	KCNS1
Length	526
Function	Potassium channel regulatory subunit that modulate the delayed rectifier voltage-gated potassium channel activity of KCNB1 and KCNB2 by altering their kinetics, expression levels, and shifting the half-inactivation potential to more polarized values (PubMed:10484328). While it does not form functional channels on its own, it can form functional heterotetrameric channels with KCNB1 and KCNB2 (PubMed:10484328). Each regulatory subunit has unique regulatory properties that can lead to extensive inhibition, significant changes in kinetics, and/or substantial shifts in the voltage dependencies of the inactivation process (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
