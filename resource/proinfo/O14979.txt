UniprotID	O14979
Accession	O14979;Q6SPF2;Q7KZ74;Q7KZ75;Q96IM0;Q96S43
EntryName	HNRDL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D-like (hnRNP D-like) (hnRNP DL) (AU-rich element RNA-binding factor) (JKT41-binding protein) (Protein laAUF1)
GeneName	HNRNPDL HNRPDL JKTBP
Length	420
Function	Acts as a transcriptional regulator. Promotes transcription repression. Promotes transcription activation in differentiated myotubes (By similarity). Binds to double- and single-stranded DNA sequences. Binds to the transcription suppressor CATR sequence of the COX5B promoter (By similarity). Binds with high affinity to RNA molecules that contain AU-rich elements (AREs) found within the 3'-UTR of many proto-oncogenes and cytokine mRNAs. Binds both to nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) mRNAs. Binds to poly(G) and poly(A), but not to poly(U) or poly(C) RNA homopolymers. Binds to the 5'-ACUAGC-3' RNA consensus sequence.
