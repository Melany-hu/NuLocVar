UniprotID	O43353-2
Accession	O43353;B7Z748;Q6UWF0
EntryName	RIPK2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (EC 2.7.11.1) (CARD-containing interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme-associated kinase) (CARD-containing IL-1 beta ICE-kinase) (RIP-like-interacting CLARP kinase) (Receptor-interacting protein 2) (RIP-2) (Tyrosine-protein kinase RIPK2) (EC 2.7.10.2)
GeneName	RIPK2 CARDIAK RICK RIP2 UNQ277/PRO314/PRO34092
Length	403
Function	Serine/threonine/tyrosine-protein kinase that plays an essential role in modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses (PubMed:14638696, PubMed:17054981, PubMed:21123652, PubMed:28656966, PubMed:9575181, PubMed:9642260). Acts as a key effector of NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathways: upon activation by bacterial peptidoglycans, NOD1 and NOD2 oligomerize and recruit RIPK2 via CARD-CARD domains, leading to the formation of RIPK2 filaments (PubMed:17054981, PubMed:17562858, PubMed:21123652, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:28656966, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). Once recruited, RIPK2 autophosphorylates and undergoes 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases XIAP, BIRC2 and BIRC3, as well as 'Met-1'-linked (linear) polyubiquitination by the LUBAC complex, becoming a scaffolding protein for downstream effectors (PubMed:22607974, PubMed:28545134, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309, PubMed:30279485, PubMed:30478312). 'Met-1'-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to RIPK2 recruit IKBKG/NEMO, which undergoes 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination in a RIPK2-dependent process (PubMed:17562858, PubMed:22607974, PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to RIPK2 serve as docking sites for TAB2 and TAB3 and mediate the recruitment of MAP3K7/TAK1 to IKBKG/NEMO, inducing subsequent activation of IKBKB/IKKB (PubMed:18079694). In turn, NF-kappa-B is released from NF-kappa-B inhibitors and translocates into the nucleus where it activates the transcription of hundreds of genes involved in immune response, growth control, or protection against apoptosis (PubMed:18079694). The protein kinase activity is dispensable for the NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathways (PubMed:29452636, PubMed:30026309). Contributes to the tyrosine phosphorylation of the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF2 through Src tyrosine kinase leading to NF-kappa-B activation by NOD2 (PubMed:21887730). Also involved in adaptive immunity: plays a role during engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) in promoting BCL10 phosphorylation and subsequent NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:14638696). Plays a role in the inactivation of RHOA in response to NGFR signaling (PubMed:26646181).
