Function	Reversibly inhibits the activity of ATP2A2/SERCA2 in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum by decreasing the apparent affinity of the ATPase for Ca(2+) (PubMed:28890335). Binds preferentially to the ATP-bound E1 conformational form of ATP2A2 which predominates at low Ca(2+) concentrations during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle (By similarity). Inhibits ATP2A2 Ca(2+) affinity by disrupting its allosteric activation by ATP (By similarity). Modulates the contractility of the heart muscle in response to physiological stimuli via its effects on ATP2A2. Modulates calcium re-uptake during muscle relaxation and plays an important role in calcium homeostasis in the heart muscle. The degree of ATP2A2 inhibition depends on the oligomeric state of PLN. ATP2A2 inhibition is alleviated by PLN phosphorylation (By similarity). Also inhibits the activity of ATP2A3/SERCA3 (By similarity). Controls intracellular Ca(2+) levels in elongated spermatids and may play a role in germ cell differentiation (By similarity). In the thalamic reticular nucleus of the brain, plays a role in the regulation of sleep patterns and executive functioning (By similarity).
