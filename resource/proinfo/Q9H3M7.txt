EntryName	TXNIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Thioredoxin-binding protein 2) (Vitamin D3 up-regulated protein 1)
GeneName	TXNIP VDUP1
Length	391
Function	May act as an oxidative stress mediator by inhibiting thioredoxin activity or by limiting its bioavailability (PubMed:17603038). Interacts with COPS5 and restores COPS5-induced suppression of CDKN1B stability, blocking the COPS5-mediated translocation of CDKN1B from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (By similarity). Functions as a transcriptional repressor, possibly by acting as a bridge molecule between transcription factors and corepressor complexes, and over-expression will induce G0/G1 cell cycle arrest (PubMed:12821938). Required for the maturation of natural killer cells (By similarity). Acts as a suppressor of tumor cell growth (PubMed:18541147). Inhibits the proteasomal degradation of DDIT4, and thereby contributes to the inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (PubMed:21460850).
