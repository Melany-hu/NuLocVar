UniprotID	Q96Q27
Accession	Q96Q27;B2RDP9;B4E166;Q9NSU5;Q9Y567
EntryName	ASB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 2 (ASB-2)
GeneName	ASB2
Length	635
Function	Substrate-recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin-Cullin-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:15590664, PubMed:16325183). Mediates Notch-induced ubiquitination and degradation of substrates including TCF3/E2A and JAK2 (PubMed:21119685). Required during embryonic heart development for complete heart looping (By similarity). Required for cardiomyocyte differentiation (PubMed:32179481). Specifically promotes the ubiquitination of SMAD9 and targets it for proteasomal degradation, leading to avoid excessive accumulation of SMAD9 (PubMed:34845242). Plays a role in the regulation of NK-cell migration by modulating protein levels of filamin A/FLNA via regulation of its ubiquitination and proteasome degradation (By similarity).
