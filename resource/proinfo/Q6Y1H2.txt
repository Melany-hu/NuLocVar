UniprotID	Q6Y1H2
Accession	Q6Y1H2
EntryName	HACD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 2 (EC 4.2.1.134) (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 2) (HACD2) (Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-like member B)
GeneName	HACD2 PTPLB
Length	254
Function	Catalyzes the third of the very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) elongation four-step cycle (condensation, reduction, dehydration, and reduction). This endoplasmic reticulum-elongation process is characterized by the addition of two carbons to the lipid chain through each cycle. This enzyme catalyzes the dehydration of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate into trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA, within each cycle of elongation. Therefore, it participates in the production of various VLCFAs involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
