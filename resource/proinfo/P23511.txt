UniprotID	P23511
Accession	P23511;Q8IXU0
EntryName	NFYA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear transcription factor Y subunit alpha (CAAT box DNA-binding protein subunit A) (Nuclear transcription factor Y subunit A) (NF-YA)
GeneName	NFYA
Length	347
Function	Component of the sequence-specific heterotrimeric transcription factor (NF-Y) which specifically recognizes a 5'-CCAAT-3' box motif found in the promoters of its target genes. NF-Y can function as both an activator and a repressor, depending on its interacting cofactors. NF-YA positively regulates the transcription of the core clock component BMAL1.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
