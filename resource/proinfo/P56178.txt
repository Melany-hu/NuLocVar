UniprotID	P56178
Accession	P56178;B7Z4P3;Q9UPL1
EntryName	DLX5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein DLX-5
GeneName	DLX5
Length	289
Function	Transcriptional factor involved in bone development. Acts as an immediate early BMP-responsive transcriptional activator essential for osteoblast differentiation. Stimulates ALPL promoter activity in a RUNX2-independent manner during osteoblast differentiation. Stimulates SP7 promoter activity during osteoblast differentiation. Promotes cell proliferation by up-regulating MYC promoter activity. Involved as a positive regulator of both chondrogenesis and chondrocyte hypertrophy in the endochondral skeleton. Binds to the homeodomain-response element of the ALPL and SP7 promoter. Binds to the MYC promoter. Requires the 5'-TAATTA-3' consensus sequence for DNA-binding.
