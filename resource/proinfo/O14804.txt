UniprotID	O14804
Accession	O14804;D8KZS1;Q2M1V1;Q4VBL1;Q5VUQ3;Q6NTA8
EntryName	TAAR5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trace amine-associated receptor 5 (TaR-5) (Trace amine receptor 5) (hTaar5) (Putative neurotransmitter receptor)
GeneName	TAAR5 PNR
Length	337
Function	Olfactory receptor specific for trimethylamine, a trace amine (PubMed:23393561). Also activated at lower level by dimethylethylamine (PubMed:23393561). Trimethylamine is a bacterial metabolite found in some animal odors, and to humans it is a repulsive odor associated with bad breath and spoiled food (PubMed:23393561). Trimethylamine-binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via G(s)-class of G alpha proteins (GNAL or GNAS) (PubMed:23393561).
