UniprotID	P27449
Accession	P27449;Q6FH26
EntryName	VATL_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase 16 kDa proteolipid subunit c (V-ATPase 16 kDa proteolipid subunit c) (Vacuolar proton pump 16 kDa proteolipid subunit c)
GeneName	ATP6V0C ATP6C ATP6L ATPL
Length	155
Function	Proton-conducting pore forming subunit of the V0 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons (PubMed:33065002, PubMed:36074901). V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments, and in some cell types, it is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane
