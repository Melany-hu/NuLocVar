UniprotID	Q8N6P7
Accession	Q8N6P7;A8K839;B2R9Y9;Q9HB22
EntryName	I22R1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL-22 receptor subunit alpha-1) (IL-22R-alpha-1) (IL-22RA1) (Cytokine receptor class-II member 9) (Cytokine receptor family 2 member 9) (CRF2-9) (ZcytoR11)
GeneName	IL22RA1 IL22R
Length	574
Function	Component of the receptor for IL20, IL22 and IL24. Component of IL22 receptor formed by IL22RA1 and IL10RB enabling IL22 signaling via JAK/STAT pathways. IL22 also induces activation of MAPK1/MAPK3 and Akt kinases pathways. Component of one of the receptor for IL20 and IL24 formed by IL22RA1 and IL20RB also signaling through STATs activation. Mediates IL24 antiangiogenic activity as well as IL24 inhibitory effect on endothelial cell tube formation and differentiation.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
