Accession	Q9NQ40;A0A2I6BQ49;A8K6P1;K0A6P4;Q5W1A0;Q5W1A1;Q8NCL7;Q96GD5
EntryName	S52A3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 52, riboflavin transporter, member 3 (Riboflavin transporter 2) (hRFT2)
GeneName	SLC52A3 C20orf54 RFT2 RFVT3
Length	469
Function	Plasma membrane transporter mediating the uptake by cells of the water soluble vitamin B2/riboflavin that plays a key role in biochemical oxidation-reduction reactions of the carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism (PubMed:20463145, PubMed:22273710, PubMed:24264046, PubMed:27702554). Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin B2/riboflavin and must obtain it via intestinal absorption (PubMed:20463145).
