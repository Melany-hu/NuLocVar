EntryName	CLIC5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chloride intracellular channel protein 5 (Glutaredoxin-like oxidoreductase CLIC5) (EC 1.8.-.-)
GeneName	CLIC5
Length	410
Function	In the soluble state, catalyzes glutaredoxin-like thiol disulfide exchange reactions with reduced glutathione as electron donor (By similarity). Can insert into membranes and form non-selective ion channels almost equally permeable to Na(+), K(+) and Cl(-) (PubMed:15184393, PubMed:18028448). Required for normal hearing (PubMed:24781754). It is necessary for the formation of stereocilia in the inner ear and normal development of the organ of Corti (By similarity). May play a role in the regulation of transepithelial ion absorption and secretion. Is required for the development and/or maintenance of the proper glomerular endothelial cell and podocyte architecture (PubMed:15184393, PubMed:18028448, PubMed:20335315). Plays a role in formation of the lens suture in the eye, which is important for normal optical properties of the lens (By similarity).
