UniprotID	P41181
Accession	P41181;Q9UD68
EntryName	AQP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) (ADH water channel) (Aquaporin-CD) (AQP-CD) (Collecting duct water channel protein) (WCH-CD) (Water channel protein for renal collecting duct)
GeneName	AQP2
Length	271
Function	Forms a water-specific channel that provides the plasma membranes of renal collecting duct with high permeability to water, thereby permitting water to move in the direction of an osmotic gradient (PubMed:15509592, PubMed:7510718, PubMed:7524315, PubMed:8140421, PubMed:8584435). Plays an essential role in renal water homeostasis (PubMed:15509592, PubMed:7524315, PubMed:8140421). Could also be permeable to glycerol (PubMed:8584435).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane; Basolateral cell membrane; Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane
