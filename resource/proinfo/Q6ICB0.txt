UniprotID	Q6ICB0
Accession	Q6ICB0
EntryName	DESI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Desumoylating isopeptidase 1 (DeSI-1) (EC 3.4.-.-) (PPPDE peptidase domain-containing protein 2) (Palmitoyl protein thioesterase DESI1) (EC 3.1.2.22) (Polyubiquitinated substrate transporter) (POST) (S-depalmitoylase DESI1)
GeneName	DESI1 FAM152B PPPDE2
Length	168
Function	Protease which deconjugates SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3 from some substrate proteins. Has isopeptidase but not SUMO-processing activity (By similarity). Desumoylates ZBTB46 (By similarity). Collaborates with UBQLN4 in the export of ubiquitinated proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (PubMed:29666234). Exhibits palmitoyl protein thioesterase (S-depalmitoylation) activity towards synthetic substrates 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-S-palmitoyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and S-depalmitoylation probe 5 (DPP-5) (PubMed:35427157).
