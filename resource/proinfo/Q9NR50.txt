EntryName	EI2BG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Translation initiation factor eIF2B subunit gamma (eIF2B GDP-GTP exchange factor subunit gamma)
GeneName	EIF2B3
Length	452
Function	Acts as a component of the translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex, which catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) complex gamma subunit (PubMed:25858979, PubMed:27023709, PubMed:31048492). Its guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity is repressed when bound to eIF2 complex phosphorylated on the alpha subunit, thereby limiting the amount of methionyl-initiator methionine tRNA available to the ribosome and consequently global translation is repressed (PubMed:25858979, PubMed:31048492).
