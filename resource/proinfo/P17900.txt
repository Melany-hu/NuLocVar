UniprotID	P17900
Accession	P17900;B2R699;D3DQH6;Q14426;Q14428;Q6LBL5
EntryName	SAP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ganglioside GM2 activator (Cerebroside sulfate activator protein) (GM2-AP) (Sphingolipid activator protein 3) (SAP-3) [Cleaved into: Ganglioside GM2 activator isoform short]
GeneName	GM2A
Length	193
Function	The large binding pocket can accommodate several single chain phospholipids and fatty acids, GM2A also exhibits some calcium-independent phospholipase activity (By similarity). Binds gangliosides and stimulates ganglioside GM2 degradation. It stimulates only the breakdown of ganglioside GM2 and glycolipid GA2 by beta-hexosaminidase A. It extracts single GM2 molecules from membranes and presents them in soluble form to beta-hexosaminidase A for cleavage of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and conversion to GM3 (By similarity). Has cholesterol transfer activity (PubMed:17552909).
