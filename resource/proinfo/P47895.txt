UniprotID	P47895
Accession	P47895;Q6NT64
EntryName	AL1A3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 3 (RALDH-3) (RalDH3) (EC 1.2.1.36) (Aldehyde dehydrogenase 6) (Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 member A3) (ALDH1A3)
GeneName	ALDH1A3 ALDH6
Length	512
Function	Catalyzes the NAD-dependent oxidation of aldehyde substrates, such as all-trans-retinal and all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinal, to their corresponding carboxylic acids, all-trans-retinoate and all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinoate, respectively (By similarity) (PubMed:27759097). High specificity for all-trans-retinal as substrate, can also accept acetaldehyde as substrate in vitro but with lower affinity (PubMed:27759097). Required for the biosynthesis of normal levels of retinoate in the embryonic ocular and nasal regions; a critical lipid in the embryonic development of the eye and the nasal region (By similarity).
