UniprotID	O95389
Accession	O95389;Q3KR29;Q5H8W4;Q6UXH6
EntryName	CCN6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cellular communication network factor 6 (CCN family member 6) (WNT1-inducible-signaling pathway protein 3) (WISP-3)
GeneName	CCN6 WISP3 UNQ462/PRO790/PRO956
Length	354
Function	Plays a role in mitochondrial electron transport and mitochondrial respiration (PubMed:27252383). Through its regulation of the mitochondrial function may play a role in normal postnatal skeletal growth and cartilage homeostasis (PubMed:10471507, PubMed:27252383).
