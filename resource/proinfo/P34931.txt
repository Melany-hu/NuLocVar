EntryName	HS71L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1-like (Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1L) (Heat shock 70 kDa protein 1-Hom) (HSP70-Hom) (Heat shock protein family A member 1L)
GeneName	HSPA1L
Length	641
Function	Molecular chaperone implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, including protection of the proteome from stress, folding and transport of newly synthesized polypeptides, activation of proteolysis of misfolded proteins and the formation and dissociation of protein complexes. Plays a pivotal role in the protein quality control system, ensuring the correct folding of proteins, the re-folding of misfolded proteins and controlling the targeting of proteins for subsequent degradation. This is achieved through cycles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, mediated by co-chaperones. The affinity for polypeptides is regulated by its nucleotide bound state. In the ATP-bound form, it has a low affinity for substrate proteins. However, upon hydrolysis of the ATP to ADP, it undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for substrate proteins. It goes through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, which permits cycles of substrate binding and release (PubMed:26865365). Positive regulator of PRKN translocation to damaged mitochondria (PubMed:24270810).
