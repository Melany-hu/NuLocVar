UniprotID	P20671
Accession	P20671;A0PK91;P57754;Q6FGY6
EntryName	H2A1D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A type 1-D (Histone H2A.3) (Histone H2A/g)
GeneName	H2AC7 H2AFG HIST1H2AD
Length	130
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
