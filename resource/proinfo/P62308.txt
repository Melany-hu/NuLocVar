UniprotID	P62308
Accession	P62308;D6W5G6;Q15357;Q6IB86
EntryName	RUXG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein G (snRNP-G) (Sm protein G) (Sm-G) (SmG)
GeneName	SNRPG PBSCG
Length	76
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing as a core component of the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:18984161, PubMed:19325628, PubMed:23333303, PubMed:25555158, PubMed:26912367, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:28781166, PubMed:32494006). Component of both the pre-catalytic spliceosome B complex and activated spliceosome C complexes (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:28781166). As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (PubMed:15146077). As part of the U7 snRNP it is involved in histone 3'-end processing (PubMed:12975319).
