UniprotID	P25208
Accession	P25208;A8K7B9;Q96IY8
EntryName	NFYB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear transcription factor Y subunit beta (CAAT box DNA-binding protein subunit B) (Nuclear transcription factor Y subunit B) (NF-YB)
GeneName	NFYB HAP3
Length	207
Function	Component of the sequence-specific heterotrimeric transcription factor (NF-Y) which specifically recognizes a 5'-CCAAT-3' box motif found in the promoters of its target genes. NF-Y can function as both an activator and a repressor, depending on its interacting cofactors.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
