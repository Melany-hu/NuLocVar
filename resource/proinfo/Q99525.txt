UniprotID	Q99525
Accession	Q99525
EntryName	H4G_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H4-like protein type G (H4-clustered histone 7)
GeneName	H4C7 H4/L H4FL HIST1H4G
Length	98
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling (By similarity).
