UniprotID	Q96DZ7
Accession	Q96DZ7;B2RV20;E9PH22;Q336K7
EntryName	T4S19_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane 4 L6 family member 19 (Osteoclast maturation-associated gene 4 protein) (Tetraspan membrane protein OCTM4)
GeneName	TM4SF19 OCTM4
Length	209
Function	Negatively regulates vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity by interacting with members of V-ATPase V0 complex and hence inhibiting V1-V0 complex assembly. Required for multinucleation during osteoclast differentiation.
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cell projection; Filopodium
