UniprotID	P84074
Accession	P84074;B2R9T3;D3DPQ7;P32076;P41211;P70510
EntryName	HPCA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuron-specific calcium-binding protein hippocalcin (Calcium-binding protein BDR-2)
GeneName	HPCA BDR2
Length	193
Function	Calcium-binding protein that may play a role in the regulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels (PubMed:28398555). May also play a role in cyclic-nucleotide-mediated signaling through the regulation of adenylate and guanylate cyclases (By similarity).
