UniprotID	Q14240
Accession	Q14240;D3DNU9;Q53XJ6;Q96B90;Q96EA8
EntryName	IF4A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-II (eIF-4A-II) (eIF4A-II) (EC 3.6.4.13) (ATP-dependent RNA helicase eIF4A-2)
GeneName	EIF4A2 DDX2B EIF4F
Length	407
Function	ATP-dependent RNA helicase which is a subunit of the eIF4F complex involved in cap recognition and is required for mRNA binding to ribosome. In the current model of translation initiation, eIF4A unwinds RNA secondary structures in the 5'-UTR of mRNAs which is necessary to allow efficient binding of the small ribosomal subunit, and subsequent scanning for the initiator codon.
