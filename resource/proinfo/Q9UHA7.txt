Accession	Q9UHA7;B2RAD9;Q53SR7;Q5BLR4;Q7RTZ8
EntryName	IL36A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-36 alpha (FIL1 epsilon) (Interleukin-1 epsilon) (IL-1 epsilon) (Interleukin-1 family member 6) (IL-1F6)
GeneName	IL36A FIL1E IL1E IL1F6
Length	158
Function	Cytokine that binds to and signals through the IL1RL2/IL-36R receptor which in turn activates NF-kappa-B and MAPK signaling pathways in target cells linked to a pro-inflammatory response. Part of the IL-36 signaling system that is thought to be present in epithelial barriers and to take part in local inflammatory response; similar to the IL-1 system with which it shares the coreceptor IL1RAP. Seems to be involved in skin inflammatory response by acting on keratinocytes, dendritic cells and indirectly on T-cells to drive tissue infiltration, cell maturation and cell proliferation. In cultured keratinocytes induces the expression of macrophage, T-cell, and neutrophil chemokines, such as CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL2, CCL17, CCL22, CL20, CCL5, CCL2, CCL17, CCL22, CXCL8, CCL20 and CXCL1, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-8 and IL-6. In cultured monocytes up-regulates expression of IL-1A, IL-1B and IL-6. In myeloid dendritic cells involved in cell maturation by up-regulating surface expression of CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR. In monocyte-derived dendritic cells facilitates dendritic cell maturation and drives T-cell proliferation. May play a role in pro-inflammatory effects in the lung.
