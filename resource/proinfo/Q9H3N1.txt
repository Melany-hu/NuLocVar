EntryName	TMX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 1 (Protein disulfide-isomerase TMX1) (EC 5.3.4.1) (Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 1) (Transmembrane Trx-related protein)
GeneName	TMX1 TMX TXNDC TXNDC1 PSEC0085 UNQ235/PRO268
Length	280
Function	Thiredoxin domain-containing protein that participates in various redox reactions through the reversible oxidation of its active center dithiol to a disulfide and catalyze dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions (PubMed:11152479, PubMed:37648867). Acts as a key inhibitor of the alternative triglyceride biosynthesis pathway by inhibiting the activity of TMEM68/DIESL at the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby restricting accumulation of triacylglycerol (PubMed:37648867). The alternative triglyceride biosynthesis pathway mediates formation of triacylglycerol from diacylglycerol and membrane phospholipids (PubMed:37648867). Acts as a protein disulfide isomerase by catalyzing formation or reduction of disulfide bonds (PubMed:22228764, PubMed:29932915). Specifically mediates formation of disulfide bonds of transmembrane proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (PubMed:22228764). Involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) via its protein disulfide isomerase activity by acting on folding-defective polypeptides at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (PubMed:29932915). Acts as a negative regulator of platelet aggregation following secretion in the extracellular space (PubMed:30425049). Acts as a regulator of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites via its ability to regulate redox signals (PubMed:27502484, PubMed:31304984). Regulates endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria Ca(2+) flux (PubMed:27502484).
