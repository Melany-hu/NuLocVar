EntryName	SOX11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor SOX-11
GeneName	SOX11
Length	441
Function	Transcription factor that acts as a transcriptional activator (PubMed:24886874, PubMed:26543203). Binds cooperatively with POU3F2/BRN2 or POU3F1/OCT6 to gene promoters, which enhances transcriptional activation (By similarity). Acts as a transcriptional activator of TEAD2 by binding to its gene promoter and first intron (By similarity). Plays a redundant role with SOX4 and SOX12 in cell survival of developing tissues such as the neural tube, branchial arches and somites, thereby contributing to organogenesis (By similarity).
