UniprotID	Q8N5M9
Accession	Q8N5M9;Q8NCF6;Q96SW1
EntryName	JAGN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein jagunal homolog 1
GeneName	JAGN1
Length	183
Function	Endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein involved in vesicle-mediated transport, which is required for neutrophil function. Required for vesicle-mediated transport; it is however unclear whether it is involved in early secretory pathway or intracellular protein transport. Acts as a regulator of neutrophil function, probably via its role in vesicle-mediated transport: required for defense against fungal pathogens and for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling pathway; possibly by regulating glycosylation and/or targeting of proteins contributing to the viability and migration of neutrophils.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
