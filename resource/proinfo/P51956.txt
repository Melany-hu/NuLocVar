UniprotID	P51956
Accession	P51956;A8K2J4;Q5TAP2;Q8J023;Q8WUN5
EntryName	NEK3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase Nek3 (EC 2.7.11.1) (HSPK 36) (Never in mitosis A-related kinase 3) (NimA-related protein kinase 3)
GeneName	NEK3
Length	506
Function	Protein kinase which influences neuronal morphogenesis and polarity through effects on microtubules. Regulates microtubule acetylation in neurons. Contributes to prolactin-mediated phosphorylation of PXN and VAV2. Implicated in prolactin-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization and motility of breast cancer cells through mechanisms involving RAC1 activation and phosphorylation of PXN and VAV2.
