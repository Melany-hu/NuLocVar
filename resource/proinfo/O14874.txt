EntryName	BCKD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDH kinase) (BCKDHKIN) (BDK) (EC 2.7.11.1) ([3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase [lipoamide]] kinase, mitochondrial) (EC 2.7.11.4)
GeneName	BCKDK
Length	412
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase component of macronutrients metabolism. Forms a functional kinase and phosphatase pair with PPM1K, serving as a metabolic regulatory node that coordinates branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) with glucose and lipid metabolism via two distinct phosphoprotein targets: mitochondrial BCKDHA subunit of the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex and cytosolic ACLY, a lipogenic enzyme of Krebs cycle (PubMed:24449431, PubMed:29779826, PubMed:37558654). Phosphorylates and inactivates mitochondrial BCKDH complex a multisubunit complex consisting of three multimeric components each involved in different steps of BCAA catabolism: E1 composed of BCKDHA and BCKDHB, E2 core composed of DBT monomers, and E3 composed of DLD monomers. Associates with the E2 component of BCKDH complex and phosphorylates BCKDHA on Ser-337, leading to conformational changes that interrupt substrate channeling between E1 and E2 and inactivates the BCKDH complex (PubMed:29779826, PubMed:37558654). Phosphorylates ACLY on Ser-455 in response to changes in cellular carbohydrate abundance such as occurs during fasting to feeding metabolic transition. Refeeding stimulates MLXIPL/ChREBP transcription factor, leading to increased BCKDK to PPM1K expression ratio, phosphorylation and activation of ACLY that ultimately results in the generation of malonyl-CoA and oxaloacetate immediate substrates of de novo lipogenesis and glucogenesis, respectively (PubMed:29779826). Recognizes phosphosites having SxxE/D canonical motif (PubMed:29779826).
