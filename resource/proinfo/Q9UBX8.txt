UniprotID	Q9UBX8
Accession	Q9UBX8;O60514;Q6NT09
EntryName	B4GT6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 6 (Beta-1,4-GalTase 6) (Beta4Gal-T6) (b4Gal-T6) (EC 2.4.1.-) (Glucosylceramide beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase) (EC 2.4.1.274) (Lactosylceramide synthase) (LacCer synthase) (UDP-Gal:beta-GlcNAc beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 6) (UDP-Gal:glucosylceramide beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase) (UDP-galactose:beta-N-acetylglucosamine beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 6)
GeneName	B4GALT6
Length	382
Function	Catalyzes the synthesis of lactosylceramide (LacCer) via the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to glucosylceramide (GlcCer) (PubMed:1551920, PubMed:24498430, PubMed:3099851). LacCer is the starting point in the biosynthesis of all gangliosides (membrane-bound glycosphingolipids) which play pivotal roles in the CNS including neuronal maturation and axonal and myelin formation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack membrane
