UniprotID	Q96FV3-3
Accession	Q96FV3;Q6NXF7;Q96S98;Q9UKB9
EntryName	TSN17_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tetraspanin-17 (Tspan-17) (F-box only protein 23) (Tetraspan protein SB134) (Transmembrane 4 superfamily member 17)
GeneName	TSPAN17 FBXO23 TM4SF17
Length	263
Function	Part of TspanC8 subgroup, composed of 6 members that interact with the transmembrane metalloprotease ADAM10. This interaction is required for ADAM10 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and for enzymatic maturation and trafficking to the cell surface as well as substrate specificity. Different TspanC8/ADAM10 complexes have distinct substrates (PubMed:28600292, PubMed:37516108). Seems to regulate VE-cadherin expression in endothelial cells probably through interaction with ADAM10, promoting leukocyte transmigration (PubMed:28600292).
