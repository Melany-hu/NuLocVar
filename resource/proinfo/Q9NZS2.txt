UniprotID	Q9NZS2
Accession	Q9NZS2;A0A0C4DGY9;Q4KMT5;Q96PR2;Q96PR3;Q9NZS1
EntryName	KLRF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily F member 1 (Lectin-like receptor F1) (Activating coreceptor NKp80) (C-type lectin domain family 5 member C)
GeneName	KLRF1 CLEC5C ML
Length	231
Function	Functions as an activating receptor involved in immunosurveillance upon binding to various ligands displayed at the surface of myeloid cells. Upon interaction with CLEC2B ligand, stimulates NK-cell cytotoxicity and cytokine production leading to the cytolysis of malignant CLEC2B-expressing myeloid cells. Actviation of the common cytotoxicity pathway involves SRC and SYK kinases (PubMed:21149606).
