UniprotID	Q6ZVX9
Accession	Q6ZVX9;Q147T6
EntryName	PAQR9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Membrane progestin receptor epsilon (mPR epsilon) (Membrane progesterone P4 receptor epsilon) (Membrane progesterone receptor epsilon) (Progesterone and adipoQ receptor family member 9) (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 9) (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member IX)
GeneName	PAQR9
Length	377
Function	Plasma membrane progesterone (P4) receptor coupled to G proteins (PubMed:23161870, PubMed:23763432). Seems to act through a G(s) mediated pathway (PubMed:23161870). May be involved in regulating rapid P4 signaling in the nervous system (PubMed:23763432). Also binds dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), pregnanolone, pregnenolone and allopregnanolone (PubMed:23161870).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
