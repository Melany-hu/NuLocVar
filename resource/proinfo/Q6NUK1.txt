EntryName	SCMC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial adenyl nucleotide antiporter SLC25A24 (Mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi carrier protein 1) (Mitochondrial Ca(2+)-dependent solute carrier protein 1) (Short calcium-binding mitochondrial carrier protein 1) (SCaMC-1) (Solute carrier family 25 member 24)
GeneName	SLC25A24 APC1 MCSC1 SCAMC1
Length	477
Function	Electroneutral antiporter that mediates the transport of adenyl nucleotides through the inner mitochondrial membrane. Originally identified as an ATP-magnesium/inorganic phosphate antiporter, it also acts as a broad specificity adenyl nucleotide antiporter. By regulating the mitochondrial matrix adenyl nucleotide pool could adapt to changing cellular energetic demands and indirectly regulate adenyl nucleotide-dependent metabolic pathways (PubMed:15123600, PubMed:22015608). In vitro, a low activity is also observed with guanyl and pyrimidine nucleotides (PubMed:15123600). May play a role in protecting cells against oxidative stress-induced cell death, by buffering calcium levels in the mitochondrial matrix through the formation of calcium-phosphate precipitates (PubMed:22015608, PubMed:29100093).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
