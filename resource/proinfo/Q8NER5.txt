UniprotID	Q8NER5
Accession	Q8NER5;Q4ZFZ8;Q86UL1;Q86UL2;Q8TBG2
EntryName	ACV1C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Activin receptor type-1C (EC 2.7.11.30) (Activin receptor type IC) (ACTR-IC) (Activin receptor-like kinase 7) (ALK-7)
GeneName	ACVR1C ALK7
Length	493
Function	Serine/threonine protein kinase which forms a receptor complex on ligand binding. The receptor complex consisting of 2 type II and 2 type I transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Type II receptors phosphorylate and activate type I receptors which autophosphorylate, then bind and activate SMAD transcriptional regulators, SMAD2 and SMAD3. Receptor for activin AB, activin B and NODAL. Plays a role in cell differentiation, growth arrest and apoptosis.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
