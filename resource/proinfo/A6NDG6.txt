UniprotID	A6NDG6
Accession	A6NDG6
EntryName	PGP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase (G3PP) (EC 3.1.3.21) (Aspartate-based ubiquitous Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatase) (AUM) (EC 3.1.3.48) (Phosphoglycolate phosphatase) (PGP)
GeneName	PGP
Length	321
Function	Glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase hydrolyzing glycerol-3-phosphate into glycerol. Thereby, regulates the cellular levels of glycerol-3-phosphate a metabolic intermediate of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism. Was also shown to have a 2-phosphoglycolate phosphatase activity and a tyrosine-protein phosphatase activity. However, their physiological relevance is unclear (PubMed:26755581). In vitro, also has a phosphatase activity toward ADP, ATP, GDP and GTP (By similarity).
