Accession	O75631;B0QY25;O60261;Q32N05;Q5TII6
EntryName	UPK3A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Uroplakin-3a (UP3a) (Uroplakin III) (UPIII)
GeneName	UPK3A UPK3
Length	287
Function	Component of the asymmetric unit membrane (AUM); a highly specialized biomembrane elaborated by terminally differentiated urothelial cells. May play an important role in AUM-cytoskeleton interaction in terminally differentiated urothelial cells. It also contributes to the formation of urothelial glycocalyx which may play an important role in preventing bacterial adherence (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
