UniprotID	Q3LI70
Accession	Q3LI70;Q3LI71
EntryName	KR196_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 19-6
GeneName	KRTAP19-6 KAP19.6
Length	58
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
