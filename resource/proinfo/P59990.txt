UniprotID	P59990
Accession	P59990;Q0VAS3
EntryName	KR121_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 12-1 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 12.1) (Keratin-associated protein 12.1)
GeneName	KRTAP12-1 KAP12.1 KRTAP12.1
Length	96
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
