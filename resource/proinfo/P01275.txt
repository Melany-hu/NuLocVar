UniprotID	P01275
Accession	P01275;A6NN65;Q53TP6
EntryName	GLUC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pro-glucagon [Cleaved into: Glicentin; Glicentin-related polypeptide (GRPP); Oxyntomodulin (OXM) (OXY); Glucagon; Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) (Incretin hormone); Glucagon-like peptide 1(7-37) (GLP-1(7-37)); Glucagon-like peptide 1(7-36) (GLP-1(7-36)); Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2)]
GeneName	GCG
Length	180
Function	Plays a key role in glucose metabolism and homeostasis. Regulates blood glucose by increasing gluconeogenesis and decreasing glycolysis. A counterregulatory hormone of insulin, raises plasma glucose levels in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Plays an important role in initiating and maintaining hyperglycemic conditions in diabetes.
