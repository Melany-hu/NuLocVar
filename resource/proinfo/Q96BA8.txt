UniprotID	Q96BA8
Accession	Q96BA8;Q8N2D5;Q96CP0
EntryName	CR3L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 1 (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 1) (Old astrocyte specifically-induced substance) (OASIS) [Cleaved into: Processed cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 1]
GeneName	CREB3L1 OASIS PSEC0238
Length	519
Function	Precursor of the transcription factor form (Processed cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 1), which is embedded in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane with N-terminal DNA-binding and transcription activation domains oriented toward the cytosolic face of the membrane (PubMed:12054625, PubMed:16417584, PubMed:25310401). In response to ER stress or DNA damage, transported to the Golgi, where it is cleaved in a site-specific manner by resident proteases S1P/MBTPS1 and S2P/MBTPS2. The released N-terminal cytosolic domain is translocated to the nucleus where it activates transcription of specific target genes involved in the cell-cycle progression inhibition (PubMed:12054625, PubMed:21767813, PubMed:25310401).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Nucleus
