UniprotID	Q6E213
Accession	Q6E213;Q6IEE3;Q6P437
EntryName	AWAT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acyl-CoA wax alcohol acyltransferase 2 (EC 2.3.1.75) (11-cis-specific retinyl-ester synthase) (11-cis-RE-synthase) (Acyl-CoA retinol O-fatty-acyltransferase) (ARAT) (Retinol O-fatty-acyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.76) (Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2-like protein 4) (EC 2.3.1.20) (Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase candidate 4) (hDC4) (Long-chain-alcohol O-fatty-acyltransferase 2) (Multifunctional O-acyltransferase) (Wax synthase) (hWS)
GeneName	AWAT2 DC4 DGAT2L4 MFAT WS
Length	333
Function	Acyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of ester bonds between fatty alcohols and fatty acyl-CoAs to form wax monoesters (PubMed:15220349, PubMed:15671038, PubMed:16106050, PubMed:28420705). Shows a preference for medium chain acyl-CoAs from C12 to C16 in length and fatty alcohols shorter than C20, as the acyl donors and acceptors, respectively (PubMed:15220349, PubMed:15671038). Also possesses acyl-CoA retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) activity that preferentially esterifies 11-cis-retinol, a chromophore precursor of bleached opsin pigments in cone cells (PubMed:16106050, PubMed:24799687). Shows higher catalytic efficiency toward 11-cis-retinol versus 9-cis-retinol, 13-cis-retinol, and all-trans-retinol substrates (PubMed:24799687).
