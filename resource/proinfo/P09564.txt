UniprotID	P09564
Accession	P09564
EntryName	CD7_HUMAN
ProteinName	T-cell antigen CD7 (GP40) (T-cell leukemia antigen) (T-cell surface antigen Leu-9) (TP41) (CD antigen CD7)
GeneName	CD7
Length	240
Function	Transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells and their precursors (PubMed:7506726). Plays a costimulatory role in T-cell activation upon binding to its ligand K12/SECTM1 (PubMed:10652336). In turn, mediates the production of cytokines such as IL-2 (PubMed:1709867). On resting NK-cells, CD7 activation results in a significant induction of interferon-gamma levels (PubMed:7506726).
