UniprotID	Q9UBS0
Accession	Q9UBS0;B2RMZ9;B4DML8;O94809;Q9UEC1
EntryName	KS6B2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-2 (S6K-beta-2) (S6K2) (EC 2.7.11.1) (70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 2) (P70S6K2) (p70-S6K 2) (S6 kinase-related kinase) (SRK) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase 14B) (p70 ribosomal S6 kinase beta) (S6K-beta) (p70 S6 kinase beta) (p70 S6K-beta) (p70 S6KB) (p70-beta)
GeneName	RPS6KB2 STK14B
Length	482
Function	Phosphorylates specifically ribosomal protein S6 (PubMed:29750193). Seems to act downstream of mTOR signaling in response to growth factors and nutrients to promote cell proliferation, cell growth and cell cycle progression in an alternative pathway regulated by MEAK7 (PubMed:29750193).
