UniprotID	Q9NUH8
Accession	Q9NUH8;Q5THN7;Q5THN8;Q96IX7;Q9BVN8
EntryName	TM14B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 14B
GeneName	TMEM14B
Length	114
Function	Primate-specific protein involved in cortical expansion and folding in the developing neocortex. May drive neural progenitor proliferation through nuclear translocation of IQGAP1, which in turn promotes G1/S cell cycle transitions.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
