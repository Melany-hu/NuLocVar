UniprotID	Q9BSE5
Accession	Q9BSE5;Q5TDH1;Q9H5J3
EntryName	GDAH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanidino acid hydrolase, mitochondrial (EC 3.5.3.-) (Arginase, mitochondrial) (EC 3.5.3.1) (Guanidinobutyrase, mitochondrial) (EC 3.5.3.7) (Guanidinopropionase, mitochondrial) (EC 3.5.3.17)
GeneName	AGMAT GDAH
Length	352
Function	Hydrolyzes linear guanidino acids to form urea and the corresponding amines. Displays specificity for substrates having a negatively charged head group and short chains including taurocyamine, guanidino propanoic and butanoic acids. May protect cells by detoxifying potentially harmful amounts of guanidino acids. Metabolizes L-arginine with low efficiency.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
