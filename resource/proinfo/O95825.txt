UniprotID	O95825
Accession	O95825;B2RDX1;B3KQ77;Q96DY0;Q9NVY7
EntryName	QORL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Quinone oxidoreductase-like protein 1 (EC 1.-.-.-) (Ferry endosomal RAB5 effector complex subunit 4) (Fy-4) (Protein 4P11) (Quinone oxidoreductase homolog 1) (QOH-1) (Zeta-crystallin homolog)
GeneName	CRYZL1 4P11 FERRY4
Length	349
Function	Component of the FERRY complex (Five-subunit Endosomal Rab5 and RNA/ribosome intermediary) (PubMed:37267905, PubMed:37267906). The FERRY complex directly interacts with mRNAs and RAB5A, and functions as a RAB5A effector involved in the localization and the distribution of specific mRNAs most likely by mediating their endosomal transport. The complex recruits mRNAs and ribosomes to early endosomes through direct mRNA-interaction (PubMed:37267905).
Subcellular Location	Early endosome
