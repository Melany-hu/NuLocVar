UniprotID	F5H013
Accession	F5H013
EntryName	F5H013_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein G (snRNP-G)
GeneName	SNRPG
Length	68
Function	Plays role in pre-mRNA splicing as core component of the SMN-Sm complex that mediates spliceosomal snRNP assembly and as component of the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome. Component of both the pre-catalytic spliceosome B complex and activated spliceosome C complexes. Is also a component of the minor U12 spliceosome. As part of the U7 snRNP it is involved in histone 3'-end processing.
