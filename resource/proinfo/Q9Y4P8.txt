EntryName	WIPI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 2 (WIPI-2) (WIPI49-like protein 2)
GeneName	WIPI2 CGI-50
Length	454
Function	Component of the autophagy machinery that controls the major intracellular degradation process by which cytoplasmic materials are packaged into autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation (PubMed:20505359, PubMed:28561066). Involved in an early step of the formation of preautophagosomal structures (PubMed:20505359, PubMed:28561066). Binds and is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) forming on membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum upon activation of the upstream ULK1 and PI3 kinases (PubMed:28561066). Mediates ER-isolation membranes contacts by interacting with the ULK1:RB1CC1 complex and PtdIns3P (PubMed:28890335). Once activated, WIPI2 recruits at phagophore assembly sites the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex that directly controls the elongation of the nascent autophagosomal membrane (PubMed:20505359, PubMed:28561066).
