UniprotID	Q8N3F0
Accession	Q8N3F0;B8ZZW9;Q8N791;Q8N8M4;Q8NEX2
EntryName	MTURN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Maturin (Maturin neural progenitor differentiation regulator protein homolog) (Protein Ells1)
GeneName	MTURN C7orf41
Length	131
Function	Promotes megakaryocyte differentiation by enhancing ERK and JNK signaling as well as up-regulating RUNX1 and FLI1 expression (PubMed:24681962). Represses NF-kappa-B transcriptional activity by inhibiting phosphorylation of RELA at 'Ser-536' (PubMed:24681962). May be involved in early neuronal development (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
