UniprotID	O15446
Accession	O15446;Q32N11;Q7Z5U2;Q9UPF6
EntryName	RPA34_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit RPA34 (A34.5) (Antisense to ERCC-1 protein) (ASE-1) (CD3-epsilon-associated protein) (CD3E-associated protein) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit G) (RNA polymerase I-associated factor PAF49)
GeneName	POLR1G ASE1 CAST CD3EAP PAF49
Length	510
Function	Component of RNA polymerase I (Pol I), a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which synthesizes ribosomal RNA precursors using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Involved in UBTF-activated transcription, presumably at a step following PIC formation.
