GeneName	ST3GAL4 CGS23 NANTA3 SIAT4C STZ
Length	333
Function	A beta-galactoside alpha2-3 sialyltransferase involved in terminal sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids (PubMed:8288606, PubMed:8611500). Catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid (N-acetyl-neuraminic acid; Neu5Ac) from the nucleotide sugar donor CMP-Neu5Ac onto acceptor Galbeta-(1->3)-GalNAc- and Galbeta-(1->4)-GlcNAc-terminated glycoconjugates through an alpha2-3 linkage (PubMed:8288606, PubMed:8611500). Plays a major role in hemostasis. Responsible for sialylation of plasma VWF/von Willebrand factor, preventing its recognition by asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPR) and subsequent clearance. Regulates ASGPR-mediated clearance of platelets (By similarity). Participates in the biosynthesis of the sialyl Lewis X epitopes, both on O- and N-glycans, which are recognized by SELE/E-selectin, SELP/P-selectin and SELL/L-selectin. Essential for selectin-mediated rolling and adhesion of leukocytes during extravasation (PubMed:25498912). Contributes to adhesion and transendothelial migration of neutrophils likely through terminal sialylation of CXCR2 (By similarity). In glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, sialylates GM1 and GA1 gangliosides to form GD1a and GM1b, respectively (PubMed:8288606). Metabolizes brain c-series ganglioside GT1c forming GQ1c (By similarity). Synthesizes ganglioside LM1 (IV3Neu5Ac-nLc4Cer), a major structural component of peripheral nerve myelin (PubMed:8611500).
