UniprotID	Q9BV29
Accession	Q9BV29;A8KAL4;Q86TC4;Q8N788;Q8NAR7
EntryName	CCD32_HUMAN
ProteinName	Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 32
GeneName	CCDC32 C15orf57
Length	185
Function	Regulates clathrin-mediated endocytsois of cargos such as transferrin probably through the association and modulation of adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) (PubMed:33859415). Has a role in ciliogenesis (By similarity). Required for proper cephalic and left/right axis development (PubMed:32307552).
