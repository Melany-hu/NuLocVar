UniprotID	P62857
Accession	P62857;P25112
EntryName	RS28_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein eS28 (40S ribosomal protein S28)
GeneName	RPS28
Length	69
Function	Component of the small ribosomal subunit (PubMed:23636399, PubMed:25901680, PubMed:25957688). The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:23636399, PubMed:25901680, PubMed:25957688). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
