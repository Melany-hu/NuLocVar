UniprotID	Q8N4J0
Accession	Q8N4J0;Q7Z383;Q8N7C5
EntryName	CARME_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carnosine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.22)
GeneName	CARNMT1 C9orf41
Length	409
Function	N-methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of anserine (beta-alanyl-N(Pi)-methyl-L-histidine) from carnosine. Anserine, a methylated derivative of carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine), is an abundant constituent of vertebrate skeletal muscles. Also methylates other L-histidine-containing di- and tripeptides such as Gly-Gly-His, Gly-His and homocarnosine (GABA-His).
