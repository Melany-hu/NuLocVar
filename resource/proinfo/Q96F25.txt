UniprotID	Q96F25
Accession	Q96F25;A8K030
EntryName	ALG14_HUMAN
ProteinName	UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase subunit ALG14 (Asparagine-linked glycosylation 14 homolog)
GeneName	ALG14
Length	216
Function	Part of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transferase complex that operates in the biosynthetic pathway of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, the glycan precursors employed in protein asparagine (N)-glycosylation. The assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides begins on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and finishes in its lumen. The sequential addition of sugars to dolichol pyrophosphate produces dolichol-linked oligosaccharides containing fourteen sugars, including two GlcNAcs, nine mannoses and three glucoses. Once assembled, the oligosaccharides are transferred from the lipid to nascent proteins by oligosaccharyltransferases. Functions as a protein-membrane adapter recruiting ALG13 at the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, where the complex catalyzes the second step of dolichol pyrophosphate biosynthesis, transferring a beta1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP-GlcNAc to GlcNAc-pyrophosphatedolichol (Gn-PDol) to produce N,N'-diacetylchitobiosyl diphosphodolichol. N,N'-diacetylchitobiosyl diphosphodolichol is a substrate for ALG1, the following enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway.
