UniprotID	Q16774
Accession	Q16774;B1ANH1
EntryName	KGUA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.8) (GMP kinase) (Guanylate kinase 1)
GeneName	GUK1 GMK GMPK
Length	197
Function	Catalyzes the phosphorylation of GMP to GDP. Essential enzyme for recycling GMP and indirectly, cyclic GMP (cGMP) (PubMed:31201273). Involved in the cGMP metabolism in photoreceptors (By similarity). It may also have a role in the survival and growth progression of some tumors (PubMed:31201273). In addition to its physiological role, GUK1 is essential for convert prodrugs used for the treatment of cancers and viral infections into their pharmacologically active metabolites, most notably acyclovir, ganciclovir, and 6-thioguanine and its closely related analog 6-mercaptopurine (PubMed:197968, PubMed:6248551, PubMed:6306664).
