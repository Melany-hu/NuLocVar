EntryName	IPMK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (EC 2.7.1.140) (EC 2.7.1.151) (EC 2.7.1.153) (Inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate 5-kinase)
GeneName	IPMK IMPK
Length	416
Function	Inositol phosphate kinase with a broad substrate specificity (PubMed:12027805, PubMed:12223481, PubMed:28882892, PubMed:30420721, PubMed:30624931). Phosphorylates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) first to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and then to inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5) (PubMed:12027805, PubMed:12223481, PubMed:28882892, PubMed:30624931). Phosphorylates inositol 1,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,6)P4) (PubMed:12223481). Phosphorylates inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5,6)P4) (By similarity). Phosphorylates glycero-3-phospho-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate to glycero-3-phospho-1D-myo-inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PubMed:28882892, PubMed:30420721). Plays an important role in MLKL-mediated necroptosis via its role in the biosynthesis of inositol pentakisphosphate (InsP5) and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6). Binding of these highly phosphorylated inositol phosphates to MLKL mediates the release of an N-terminal auto-inhibitory region, leading to activation of the kinase. Essential for activated phospho-MLKL to oligomerize and localize to the cell membrane during necroptosis (PubMed:29883610). Required for normal embryonic development, probably via its role in the biosynthesis of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5) and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) (By similarity).
