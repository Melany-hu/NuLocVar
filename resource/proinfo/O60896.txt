UniprotID	O60896
Accession	O60896;Q7Z2Y1
EntryName	RAMP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Receptor activity-modifying protein 3 (Calcitonin-receptor-like receptor activity-modifying protein 3) (CRLR activity-modifying protein 3)
GeneName	RAMP3
Length	148
Function	Accessory protein that interacts with and modulates the function of G-protein coupled receptors including calcitonin gene-related peptide type 1 receptor (CALCRL), calcitonin receptor (CALCR) and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) (PubMed:23674134, PubMed:9620797). Required for the transport of CALCRL and GPER1 receptors to the plasma membrane (PubMed:23674134, PubMed:9620797). Plays a role in cardioprotection by reducing cardiac hypertrophy and perivascular fibrosis in a GPER1-dependent manner (PubMed:23674134). Together with CALCRL, form a receptor complex for adrenomedullin/ADM and intermedin/ADM2 (PubMed:32296767). Together with CALCR, act as a receptor complex for amylin/IAPP (PubMed:35324283).
