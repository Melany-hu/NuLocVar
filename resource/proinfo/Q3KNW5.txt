UniprotID	Q3KNW5
Accession	Q3KNW5;Q70EX7
EntryName	SOAT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium-dependent organic anion transporter (SOAT) (Solute carrier family 10 member 6) (SLC10A6)
GeneName	SLC10A6 SOAT
Length	377
Function	Transports sulfoconjugated steroid hormones from the extracellular compartment into the cytosol in a sodium-dependent manner without hydrolysis (PubMed:17491011, PubMed:23667501, PubMed:24717977, PubMed:28951227). Steroid sulfate hormones are commonly considered to be biologically inactive metabolites, that may be activated by steroid sulfatases into free steroids (PubMed:23667501, PubMed:24717977). May play an important role by delivering sulfoconjugated steroids to specific target cells in reproductive organs (By similarity). May play a role transporting the estriol precursor 16alpha-hydroxydehydroepiandrosterone 3-sulfate (16a-OH-DHEAS) at the fetal blood vessel endothelium (PubMed:24717977). Can also transport other sulfoconjugated molecules such as taurolithocholic acid-3-sulfate and sulfoconjugated pyrenes (PubMed:17491011).
