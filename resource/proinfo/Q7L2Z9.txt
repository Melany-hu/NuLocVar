Accession	Q7L2Z9;A8KAF1;Q6IN61;Q9NVS5
EntryName	CENPQ_HUMAN
ProteinName	Centromere protein Q (CENP-Q)
GeneName	CENPQ C6orf139
Length	268
Function	Component of the CENPA-CAD (nucleosome distal) complex, a complex recruited to centromeres which is involved in assembly of kinetochore proteins, mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. May be involved in incorporation of newly synthesized CENPA into centromeres via its interaction with the CENPA-NAC complex (PubMed:16622420). Plays an important role in chromosome congression and in the recruitment of CENP-O complex (which comprises CENPO, CENPP, CENPQ and CENPU), CENPE and PLK1 to the kinetochores (PubMed:25395579).
