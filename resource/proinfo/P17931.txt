UniprotID	P17931
Accession	P17931;B2RC38;Q16005;Q6IBA7;Q96J47
EntryName	LEG3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Galectin-3 (Gal-3) (35 kDa lectin) (Carbohydrate-binding protein 35) (CBP 35) (Galactose-specific lectin 3) (Galactoside-binding protein) (GALBP) (IgE-binding protein) (L-31) (Laminin-binding protein) (Lectin L-29) (Mac-2 antigen)
GeneName	LGALS3 MAC2
Length	250
Function	Galactose-specific lectin which binds IgE. May mediate with the alpha-3, beta-1 integrin the stimulation by CSPG4 of endothelial cells migration. Together with DMBT1, required for terminal differentiation of columnar epithelial cells during early embryogenesis (By similarity). In the nucleus: acts as a pre-mRNA splicing factor. Involved in acute inflammatory responses including neutrophil activation and adhesion, chemoattraction of monocytes macrophages, opsonization of apoptotic neutrophils, and activation of mast cells. Together with TRIM16, coordinates the recognition of membrane damage with mobilization of the core autophagy regulators ATG16L1 and BECN1 in response to damaged endomembranes.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Secreted
