Length	370
Function	Deubiquitinating enzyme that plays various roles in the regulation of the immune response and inflammation (PubMed:19075014, PubMed:27373336). During TCR engagement and activation, translocates into the cytoplasm and deubiquitinates its substrates LAT and TRAT1 and prevents their lysosome-dependent degradation to stabilize the TCR signaling complex at the plasma membrane (PubMed:26811477). Plays an essential role in the selective LPS-induced macrophage response through the activation of NF-kappa-B pathway (PubMed:28063927). In addition, promotes that antiviral immune response through targeting DNA sensor IFI16 to inhibit its proteasome-dependent degradation (PubMed:37410794). Participates in the interferon signaling pathway and antiviral response independently of its deubiquitinase activity by maintaining nuclear phosphorylated STAT1 levels via inhibition of its CREBBP-mediated acetylation and subsequent dephosphorylation (PubMed:31899788). Plays an intrinsic role in promoting the differentiation, activation and proliferation of CD4(+) T-cell by activating the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway through deubiquitinating and stabilizing B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10/BCL10 (By similarity). In myeloid-derived suppressor cells promotes the activation of the NF-kappa-B via deubiquitination and stabilization of RELA (By similarity). Regulates the 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains of BAX and thereby modulates the mitochondrial apoptotic process (PubMed:36361894). Negative regulator of NOTCH signaling that specifically deubiquitinates non-activated NOTCH receptors to target them for lysosomal degradation; deubiquitination of NOTCH stimulates its transport form late endosomes to lysosomes (PubMed:22778262). Protects neurons against HTT/huntingtin-induced polyglutamine expansion-dependent neurodegeneration through regulation of autophagic flux (PubMed:30266909). This function is independent of deubiquitinase activity or of other components of the USP12-WDR20-WDR48 deubiquitinating complex (By similarity). In complex with WDR48, acts as a potential tumor suppressor by positively regulating PHLPP1 stability (PubMed:24145035).
