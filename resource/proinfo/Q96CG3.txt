UniprotID	Q96CG3
Accession	Q96CG3
EntryName	TIFA_HUMAN
ProteinName	TRAF-interacting protein with FHA domain-containing protein A (Putative MAPK-activating protein PM14) (Putative NF-kappa-B-activating protein 20) (TRAF2-binding protein)
GeneName	TIFA T2BP
Length	184
Function	Adapter molecule that plays a key role in the activation of pro-inflammatory NF-kappa-B signaling following detection of bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern metabolites (PAMPs) (PubMed:12566447, PubMed:15492226, PubMed:26068852, PubMed:28222186, PubMed:28877472, PubMed:30111836). Promotes activation of an innate immune response by inducing the oligomerization and polyubiquitination of TRAF6, which leads to the activation of TAK1 and IKK through a proteasome-independent mechanism (PubMed:15492226, PubMed:26068852). TIFA-dependent innate immune response is triggered by ADP-D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose (ADP-Heptose), a potent PAMP present in all Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria: ADP-Heptose is recognized by ALPK1, which phosphorylates TIFA at Thr-9, leading to TIFA homooligomerization and subsequent activation of pro-inflammatory NF-kappa-B signaling (PubMed:30111836).
