UniprotID	Q9Y271
Accession	Q9Y271;B2R954;D3DTE4;Q5JS94;Q8IV19
EntryName	CLTR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) (Cysteinyl leukotriene D4 receptor) (LTD4 receptor) (G-protein coupled receptor HG55) (HMTMF81)
GeneName	CYSLTR1 CYSLT1
Length	337
Function	Receptor for cysteinyl leukotrienes mediating bronchoconstriction of individuals with and without asthma. Stimulation by LTD4 results in the contraction and proliferation of smooth muscle, edema, eosinophil migration and damage to the mucus layer in the lung. This response is mediated via a G-protein that activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. The rank order of affinities for the leukotrienes is LTD4 >> LTE4 = LTC4 >> LTB4.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
