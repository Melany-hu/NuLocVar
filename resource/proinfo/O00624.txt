UniprotID	O00624
Accession	O00624;A6NK81;A6NLD6;Q5TB84;Q76P85
EntryName	NPT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 3 (Na(+)/PI cotransporter 3) (Sodium/phosphate cotransporter 3) (Solute carrier family 17 member 2)
GeneName	SLC17A2 NPT3
Length	439
Function	Acts as a membrane potential-dependent organic anion transporter, the transport requires a low concentration of chloride ions (By similarity). Mediates chloride-dependent transport of urate (By similarity). Can actively transport inorganic phosphate into cells via Na(+) cotransport (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane
