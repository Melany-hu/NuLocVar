EntryName	DHB7_HUMAN
ProteinName	3-keto-steroid reductase/17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 7 (17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 7) (17-beta-HSD 7) (3-keto-steroid reductase) (EC 1.1.1.270) (Dihydrotestosterone oxidoreductase) (EC 1.1.1.210) (Estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase 7) (EC 1.1.1.62) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 37C member 1)
GeneName	HSD17B7 17HSD7 SDR37C1 UNQ2563/PRO6243
Length	341
Function	Bifunctional enzyme involved in steroid-hormone metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis (PubMed:11165030, PubMed:12574203, PubMed:12732193, PubMed:12829805, PubMed:19772289, PubMed:20659585). Catalyzes the NADP(H)-dependent reduction of estrogens and androgens and regulates the biological potency of these steroids. Converts estrone (E1) to a more potent estrogen, 17beta-estradiol (E2) (PubMed:12574203, PubMed:12732193, PubMed:19772289). Converts dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to its inactive form 5a-androstane-3b,17b-diol (PubMed:12574203, PubMed:12732193, PubMed:19772289). Converts moderately progesterone to 3beta-hydroxypregn-4-ene-20-one, leading to its inactivation (PubMed:12574203, PubMed:12732193). Additionally, participates in the post-squalene cholesterol biosynthesis, as a 3-ketosteroid reductase (PubMed:11165030, PubMed:12829805, PubMed:20659585).
