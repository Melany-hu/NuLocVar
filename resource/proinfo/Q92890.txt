EntryName	UFD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin recognition factor in ER-associated degradation protein 1 (Ubiquitin fusion degradation protein 1) (UB fusion protein 1)
GeneName	UFD1 UFD1L
Length	307
Function	Essential component of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway which degrades ubiquitin fusion proteins. The ternary complex containing UFD1, VCP and NPLOC4 binds ubiquitinated proteins and is necessary for the export of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytoplasm, where they are degraded by the proteasome. The NPLOC4-UFD1-VCP complex regulates spindle disassembly at the end of mitosis and is necessary for the formation of a closed nuclear envelope. It may be involved in the development of some ectoderm-derived structures (By similarity). Acts as a negative regulator of type I interferon production via the complex formed with VCP and NPLOC4, which binds to RIGI and recruits RNF125 to promote ubiquitination and degradation of RIGI (PubMed:26471729).
