ProteinName	Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP kinase kinase 4) (MAPKK 4) (EC 2.7.12.2) (JNK-activating kinase 1) (MAPK/ERK kinase 4) (MEK 4) (SAPK/ERK kinase 1) (SEK1) (Stress-activated protein kinase kinase 1) (SAPK kinase 1) (SAPKK-1) (SAPKK1) (c-Jun N-terminal kinase kinase 1) (JNKK)
GeneName	MAP2K4 JNKK1 MEK4 MKK4 PRKMK4 SEK1 SERK1 SKK1
Length	399
Function	Dual specificity protein kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. Essential component of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. With MAP2K7/MKK7, is the one of the only known kinase to directly activate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinases MAPK8/JNK1, MAPK9/JNK2 and MAPK10/JNK3. MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 both activate the JNKs by phosphorylation, but they differ in their preference for the phosphorylation site in the Thr-Pro-Tyr motif. MAP2K4 shows preference for phosphorylation of the Tyr residue and MAP2K7/MKK7 for the Thr residue. The phosphorylation of the Thr residue by MAP2K7/MKK7 seems to be the prerequisite for JNK activation at least in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, while other stimuli activate both MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 which synergistically phosphorylate JNKs. MAP2K4 is required for maintaining peripheral lymphoid homeostasis. The MKK/JNK signaling pathway is also involved in mitochondrial death signaling pathway, including the release cytochrome c, leading to apoptosis. Whereas MAP2K7/MKK7 exclusively activates JNKs, MAP2K4/MKK4 additionally activates the p38 MAPKs MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and MAPK14.
