UniprotID	P15248
Accession	P15248
EntryName	IL9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-9 (IL-9) (Cytokine P40) (T-cell growth factor P40)
GeneName	IL9
Length	144
Function	Multifunctional cytokine secreted mainly by T-helper 2 lymphocytes and also mast cells or NKT cells that plays important roles in the immune response against parasites (PubMed:29742432). Affects intestinal epithelial permeability and adaptive immunity (PubMed:29742432). In addition, induces the differentiation of specific T-cell subsets such as IL-17 producing helper T-cells (TH17) and also proliferation and differentiation of mast cells. Mechanistically, exerts its biological effects through a receptor composed of IL9R subunit and a signal transducing subunit IL2RG. Receptor stimulation results in the rapid activation of JAK1 and JAK3 kinase activities leading to STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5-mediated transcriptional programs. Induction of differentiation genes seems to be mediated by STAT1 alone, while protection of cells from apoptosis depends on STAT3 and STAT5.
