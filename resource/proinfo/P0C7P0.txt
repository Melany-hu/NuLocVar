UniprotID	P0C7P0
Accession	P0C7P0
EntryName	CISD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	CDGSH iron-sulfur domain-containing protein 3, mitochondrial (MitoNEET-related protein 2) (Miner2) (Mitochondrial inner NEET protein) (MiNT)
GeneName	CISD3
Length	127
Function	Can transfer its iron-sulfur clusters to the apoferrodoxins FDX1 and FDX2. Contributes to mitochondrial iron homeostasis and in maintaining normal levels of free iron and reactive oxygen species, and thereby contributes to normal mitochondrial function.
