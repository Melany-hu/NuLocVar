EntryName	NK2R_HUMAN
ProteinName	Substance-K receptor (SKR) (NK-2 receptor) (NK-2R) (Neurokinin A receptor) (Tachykinin receptor 2)
GeneName	TACR2 NK2R NKNAR TAC2R
Length	398
Function	This is a receptor for the tachykinin neuropeptide substance K (neurokinin A). It is associated with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. The rank order of affinity of this receptor to tachykinins is: substance K > neuromedin-K > substance P.
