UniprotID	Q9BXJ8-2
Accession	Q9BXJ8;Q86TE9;Q8N6P1
EntryName	TACAN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 120A (Protein TACAN) (Transmembrane protein induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha)
GeneName	TMEM120A TACAN TMPIT
Length	322
Function	Multifunctional protein involved in mechanosensation, and plays an essential role in lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation (PubMed:26024229, PubMed:36420836). May function as a potential ion channel involved in sensing mechanical stimuli (PubMed:35235791). Mediates the mechanosensitivity of the PKD2-TMEM120A channel complex through direct physical interaction (PubMed:36420836). TMEM120A seems to affect mechanosensation by inhibiting PIEZO2 channels, possibly by altering cellular lipid content (By similarity). TMEM120A is structurally similar to a lipid-modifying enzyme, ELOVL7, and contains a bound coenzyme A molecule, which suggests it might function as an enzyme in lipid metabolism (PubMed:34374645, PubMed:34409941, PubMed:34465718). Additionnaly, implicated in innate immune response against Zika virus. Acts as a key activator of the antiviral signaling involving STING1 (PubMed:35013224).
