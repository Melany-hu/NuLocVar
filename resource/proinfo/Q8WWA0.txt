EntryName	ITLN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Intelectin-1 (ITLN-1) (Endothelial lectin HL-1) (Galactofuranose-binding lectin) (Intestinal lactoferrin receptor) (Omentin)
GeneName	ITLN1 INTL ITLN LFR UNQ640/PRO1270
Length	313
Function	Lectin that specifically recognizes microbial carbohydrate chains in a calcium-dependent manner (PubMed:11313366, PubMed:26148048). Binds to microbial glycans that contain a terminal acyclic 1,2-diol moiety, including beta-linked D-galactofuranose (beta-Galf), D-phosphoglycerol-modified glycans, D-glycero-D-talo-oct-2-ulosonic acid (KO) and 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (KDO) (PubMed:26148048). Binds to glycans from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including K.pneumoniae, S.pneumoniae, Y.pestis, P.mirabilis and P.vulgaris (PubMed:26148048). Does not bind human glycans (PubMed:26148048). Probably plays a role in the defense system against microorganisms (Probable). May function as adipokine that has no effect on basal glucose uptake but enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes (PubMed:16531507). Increases AKT phosphorylation in the absence and presence of insulin (PubMed:16531507). May interact with lactoferrin/LTF and increase its uptake, and may thereby play a role in iron absorption (PubMed:11747454, PubMed:23921499).
