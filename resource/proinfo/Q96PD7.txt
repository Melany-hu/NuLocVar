EntryName	DGAT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (EC 2.3.1.20) (Acyl-CoA retinol O-fatty-acyltransferase) (ARAT) (Retinol O-fatty-acyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.76) (Diglyceride acyltransferase 2)
GeneName	DGAT2 HMFN1045 UNQ738/PRO1433
Length	388
Function	Essential acyltransferase that catalyzes the terminal and only committed step in triacylglycerol synthesis by using diacylglycerol and fatty acyl CoA as substrates. Required for synthesis and storage of intracellular triglycerides (PubMed:27184406). Probably plays a central role in cytosolic lipid accumulation. In liver, is primarily responsible for incorporating endogenously synthesized fatty acids into triglycerides (By similarity). Also functions as an acyl-CoA retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) (By similarity). Also able to use 1-monoalkylglycerol (1-MAkG) as an acyl acceptor for the synthesis of monoalkyl-monoacylglycerol (MAMAG) (PubMed:28420705).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Lipid droplet; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region
