UniprotID	Q5RI15
Accession	Q5RI15;Q8WV86
EntryName	COX20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome c oxidase assembly protein COX20, mitochondrial
GeneName	COX20 FAM36A
Length	118
Function	Essential for the assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV (CIV), also known as cytochrome c oxidase (PubMed:23125284). Acts as a chaperone in the early steps of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (MT-CO2/COX2) maturation, stabilizing the newly synthesized protein and presenting it to metallochaperones SCO1/2 which in turn facilitates the incorporation of the mature MT-CO2/COX2 into the assembling CIV holoenzyme (PubMed:24403053).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
