UniprotID	Q9BV47
Accession	Q9BV47;D3DSV8;Q9BTW0
EntryName	DUS26_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity protein phosphatase 26 (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.48) (Dual specificity phosphatase SKRP3) (Low-molecular-mass dual-specificity phosphatase 4) (DSP-4) (LDP-4) (Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 8) (MAP kinase phosphatase 8) (MKP-8) (Novel amplified gene in thyroid anaplastic cancer)
GeneName	DUSP26 DUSP24 LDP4 MKP8 NATA1 SKRP3
Length	211
Function	Inactivates MAPK1 and MAPK3 which leads to dephosphorylation of heat shock factor protein 4 and a reduction in its DNA-binding activity. Inhibits MAP kinase p38 by dephosphorylating it and inhibits p38-mediated apoptosis in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. Can also induce activation of MAP kinase p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Golgi apparatus
