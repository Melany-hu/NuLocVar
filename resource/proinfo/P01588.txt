EntryName	EPO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Erythropoietin (Epoetin)
GeneName	EPO
Length	193
Function	Hormone involved in the regulation of erythrocyte proliferation and differentiation and the maintenance of a physiological level of circulating erythrocyte mass (PubMed:28283061). Binds to EPOR leading to EPOR dimerization and JAK2 activation thereby activating specific downstream effectors, including STAT1 and STAT3 (PubMed:9774108).
