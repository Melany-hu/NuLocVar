UniprotID	Q8TAP8
Accession	Q8TAP8;A4D2C5
EntryName	PPR35_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 35
GeneName	PPP1R35 C7orf47
Length	253
Function	During centriole duplication, plays a role in the centriole elongation by promoting the recruitment of the microtubule-binding elongation machinery through its interaction with RTTN, leading to the centriole to centrosome conversion (PubMed:30168418, PubMed:30230954). In addition, may play a role in the primary cilia assembly (By similarity).
