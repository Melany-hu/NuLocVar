UniprotID	Q7Z4M0
Accession	Q7Z4M0
EntryName	RE114_HUMAN
ProteinName	Meiotic recombination protein REC114
GeneName	REC114 C15orf60
Length	266
Function	Required for DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) formation in unsynapsed regions during meiotic recombination (PubMed:38148155). Probably acts by forming a complex with IHO1 and MEI4, which activates DSBs formation in unsynapsed regions, an essential step to ensure completion of synapsis (By similarity). Required for spermatogenesis (PubMed:38148155). Required for oogenesis.
Subcellular Location	Chromosome
