EntryName	TIM50_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit TIM50
GeneName	TIMM50 TIM50 PRO1512
Length	353
Function	Essential component of the TIM23 complex, a complex that mediates the translocation of transit peptide-containing proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane (PubMed:30190335, PubMed:38828998). Has some phosphatase activity in vitro; however such activity may not be relevant in vivo.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Nucleus speckle
