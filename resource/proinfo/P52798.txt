UniprotID	P52798
Accession	P52798;C9JHJ8;G3XAK2;O95457;Q5SR71;Q6FI57
EntryName	EFNA4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ephrin-A4 (EPH-related receptor tyrosine kinase ligand 4) (LERK-4)
GeneName	EFNA4 EPLG4 LERK4
Length	201
Function	Cell surface GPI-bound ligand for Eph receptors, a family of receptor tyrosine kinases which are crucial for migration, repulsion and adhesion during neuronal, vascular and epithelial development. Binds promiscuously Eph receptors residing on adjacent cells, leading to contact-dependent bidirectional signaling into neighboring cells. May play a role in the interaction between activated B-lymphocytes and dendritic cells in tonsils.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted
