EntryName	MARE3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 3 (EB1 protein family member 3) (EBF3) (End-binding protein 3) (EB3) (RP3)
GeneName	MAPRE3
Length	281
Function	Plus-end tracking protein (+TIP) that binds to the plus-end of microtubules and regulates the dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton (PubMed:19255245, PubMed:28814570). Promotes microtubule growth (PubMed:19255245, PubMed:28814570). May be involved in spindle function by stabilizing microtubules and anchoring them at centrosomes (PubMed:19255245, PubMed:28814570). Also acts as a regulator of minus-end microtubule organization: interacts with the complex formed by AKAP9 and PDE4DIP, leading to recruit CAMSAP2 to the Golgi apparatus, thereby tethering non-centrosomal minus-end microtubules to the Golgi, an important step for polarized cell movement (PubMed:28814570). Promotes elongation of CAMSAP2-decorated microtubule stretches on the minus-end of microtubules (PubMed:28814570).
