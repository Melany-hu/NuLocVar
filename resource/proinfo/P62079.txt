UniprotID	P62079
Accession	P62079;B2RDY2;O60628;O60746;Q6FHE5;Q9JLY1
EntryName	TSN5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tetraspanin-5 (Tspan-5) (Tetraspan NET-4) (Transmembrane 4 superfamily member 9)
GeneName	TSPAN5 TM4SF9
Length	268
Function	Part of TspanC8 subgroup, composed of 6 members that interact with the transmembrane metalloprotease ADAM10. This interaction is required for ADAM10 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and for enzymatic maturation and trafficking to the cell surface as well as substrate specificity. Different TspanC8/ADAM10 complexes have distinct substrates (PubMed:26686862, PubMed:28600292, PubMed:37516108). Promotes ADAM10-mediated cleavage of CD44 (PubMed:26686862). Seems to regulate VE-cadherin expression in endothelial cells probably through interaction with ADAM10, promoting leukocyte transmigration (PubMed:28600292).
