UniprotID	Q15942
Accession	Q15942;A4D2G6;B4DQX7;Q6I9S4
EntryName	ZYX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zyxin (Zyxin-2)
GeneName	ZYX
Length	572
Function	Adhesion plaque protein. Binds alpha-actinin and the CRP protein. Important for targeting TES and ENA/VASP family members to focal adhesions and for the formation of actin-rich structures. May be a component of a signal transduction pathway that mediates adhesion-stimulated changes in gene expression (By similarity).
