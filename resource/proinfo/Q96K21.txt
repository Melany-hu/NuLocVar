Accession	Q96K21;B3KVB2;C9JNF4;H3BUF9;Q86WC2;Q8WU96
EntryName	ANCHR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Abscission/NoCut checkpoint regulator (ANCHR) (MLL partner containing FYVE domain) (Zinc finger FYVE domain-containing protein 19)
GeneName	ZFYVE19 ANCHR MPFYVE
Length	471
Function	Key regulator of abscission step in cytokinesis: part of the cytokinesis checkpoint, a process required to delay abscission to prevent both premature resolution of intercellular chromosome bridges and accumulation of DNA damage. Together with CHMP4C, required to retain abscission-competent VPS4 (VPS4A and/or VPS4B) at the midbody ring until abscission checkpoint signaling is terminated at late cytokinesis. Deactivation of AURKB results in dephosphorylation of CHMP4C followed by its dissociation from ZFYVE19/ANCHR and VPS4 and subsequent abscission.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome; Cleavage furrow; Midbody; Midbody ring
