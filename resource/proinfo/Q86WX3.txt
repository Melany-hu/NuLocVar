UniprotID	Q86WX3
Accession	Q86WX3;B0QY96;Q5JZA1
EntryName	AROS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Active regulator of SIRT1 (40S ribosomal protein S19-binding protein 1) (RPS19-binding protein 1) (S19BP)
GeneName	RPS19BP1 AROS
Length	136
Function	Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome. Acts as a chaperone that specifically mediates the integration of RPS19 in state post-A1 (PubMed:34516797). Direct regulator of SIRT1. Enhances SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53/TP53, thereby participating in inhibition of p53/TP53-mediated transcriptional activity (PubMed:17964266).
