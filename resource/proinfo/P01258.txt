EntryName	CALC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcitonin [Cleaved into: Calcitonin (CT); Katacalcin (Calcitonin carboxyl-terminal peptide) (CCP) (PDN-21)]
GeneName	CALCA CALC1
Length	141
Function	Calcitonin is a peptide hormone that causes a rapid but short-lived drop in the level of calcium and phosphate in blood by promoting the incorporation of those ions in the bones. Calcitonin function is mediated by the calcitonin receptor/CALCR and the CALCR-RAMP2 (AMYR2) receptor complex (PubMed:35324283).
