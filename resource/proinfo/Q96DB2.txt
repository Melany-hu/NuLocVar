UniprotID	Q96DB2
Accession	Q96DB2;B4DDK1;Q9H6I7;Q9H6X3;Q9NTC9
EntryName	HDA11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone deacetylase 11 (HD11) (EC 3.5.1.98)
GeneName	HDAC11
Length	347
Function	Responsible for the deacetylation of lysine residues on the N-terminal part of the core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). Histone deacetylation gives a tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and developmental events. Histone deacetylases act via the formation of large multiprotein complexes.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
