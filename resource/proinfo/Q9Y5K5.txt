Accession	Q9Y5K5;Q5LJA6;Q5LJA7;Q8TBS4;Q96BJ9;Q9H1W5;Q9P0I3;Q9UQN2
EntryName	UCHL5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L5 (UCH-L5) (EC 3.4.19.12) (Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase UCH37) (Ubiquitin thioesterase L5)
GeneName	UCHL5 UCH37 AD-019 CGI-70
Length	329
Function	Protease that specifically cleaves 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains. Deubiquitinating enzyme associated with the 19S regulatory subunit of the 26S proteasome. Putative regulatory component of the INO80 complex; however is inactive in the INO80 complex and is activated by a transient interaction of the INO80 complex with the proteasome via ADRM1.
