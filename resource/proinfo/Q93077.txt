UniprotID	Q93077
Accession	Q93077;B2R4F7;O00775;O00776;O00777;O00778;Q540R1
EntryName	H2A1C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A type 1-C (H2A-clustered histone 6) (Histone H2A/l)
GeneName	H2AC6 H2AFL HIST1H2AC
Length	130
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
