UniprotID	Q9UNG2
Accession	Q9UNG2;A9IQG8;O95852;Q6ISV1
EntryName	TNF18_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 18 (Activation-inducible TNF-related ligand) (AITRL) (Glucocorticoid-induced TNF-related ligand) (hGITRL)
GeneName	TNFSF18 AITRL GITRL TL6 UNQ149/PRO175
Length	177
Function	Cytokine that binds to TNFRSF18/AITR/GITR. Regulates T-cell responses. Can function as costimulator and lower the threshold for T-cell activation and T-cell proliferation. Important for interactions between activated T-lymphocytes and endothelial cells. Mediates activation of NF-kappa-B. Triggers increased phosphorylation of STAT1 and up-regulates expression of VCAM1 and ICAM1 (PubMed:23892569). Promotes leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells (PubMed:23892569). Regulates migration of monocytes from the splenic reservoir to sites of inflammation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
