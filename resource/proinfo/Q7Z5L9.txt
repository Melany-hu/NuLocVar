Accession	Q7Z5L9;B1AM35;B1AM36;Q6P083;Q7Z5L8;Q8N351;Q8WUH8
EntryName	I2BP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon regulatory factor 2-binding protein 2 (IRF-2-binding protein 2) (IRF-2BP2)
GeneName	IRF2BP2
Length	587
Function	Acts as a transcriptional corepressor in a IRF2-dependent manner; this repression is not mediated by histone deacetylase activities (PubMed:12799427). Represses the NFAT1-dependent transactivation of NFAT-responsive promoters (PubMed:21576369). Acts as a coactivator of VEGFA expression in cardiac and skeletal muscles (PubMed:20702774). Plays a role in immature B-cell differentiation (PubMed:27016798).
