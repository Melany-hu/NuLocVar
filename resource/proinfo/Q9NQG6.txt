UniprotID	Q9NQG6
Accession	Q9NQG6;Q52MA5;Q7L890;Q9BUI3
EntryName	MID51_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial dynamics protein MIEF1 (Mitochondrial dynamics protein of 51 kDa) (Mitochondrial elongation factor 1) (Smith-Magenis syndrome chromosomal region candidate gene 7 protein-like) (SMCR7-like protein)
GeneName	MIEF1 MID51 SMCR7L
Length	463
Function	Mitochondrial outer membrane protein which regulates mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics (PubMed:21701560, PubMed:23921378, PubMed:33632269). Promotes the recruitment and association of the fission mediator dynamin-related protein 1 (DNM1L) to the mitochondrial surface independently of the mitochondrial fission FIS1 and MFF proteins. Regulates DNM1L GTPase activity and DNM1L oligomerization. Binds ADP and can also bind GDP, although with lower affinity. Does not bind CDP, UDP, ATP, AMP or GTP. Inhibits DNM1L GTPase activity in the absence of bound ADP. Requires ADP to stimulate DNM1L GTPase activity and the assembly of DNM1L into long, oligomeric tubules with a spiral pattern, as opposed to the ring-like DNM1L oligomers observed in the absence of bound ADP. Does not require ADP for its function in recruiting DNM1L.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane
