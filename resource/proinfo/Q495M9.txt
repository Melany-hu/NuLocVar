UniprotID	Q495M9
Accession	Q495M9;Q8N251
EntryName	USH1G_HUMAN
ProteinName	pre-mRNA splicing regulator USH1G (Scaffold protein containing ankyrin repeats and SAM domain) (Usher syndrome type-1G protein)
GeneName	USH1G SANS
Length	461
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing by regulating the release and transfer of U4/U6.U5 tri-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (tri-snRNP) complexes from their assembly site in Cajal bodies to nuclear speckles, thereby contributing to the assembly of the pre-catalytic spliceosome on target pre-mRNAs (PubMed:34023904). May also participate in recycling of snRNPs back to Cajal bodies during splicing (PubMed:34023904). Plays a role in regulating MAGI2-mediated endocytosis (PubMed:24608321). Anchoring/scaffolding protein that is a part of the functional network formed by USH1C, USH1G, CDH23 and MYO7A that mediates mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells. Required for normal development and maintenance of cochlear hair cell bundles. Required for normal hearing.
