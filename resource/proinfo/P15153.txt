UniprotID	P15153
Accession	P15153;Q9UDJ4
EntryName	RAC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 2 (EC 3.6.5.2) (GX) (Small G protein) (p21-Rac2)
GeneName	RAC2
Length	192
Function	Plasma membrane-associated small GTPase which cycles between an active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound state (PubMed:30723080). In its active state, binds to a variety of effector proteins to regulate cellular responses, such as secretory processes, phagocytose of apoptotic cells and epithelial cell polarization. Regulatory subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex that mediates the transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADPH to O2 to produce the superoxide anion (O2(-)) (PubMed:1660188).
