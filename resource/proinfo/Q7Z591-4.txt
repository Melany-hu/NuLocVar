EntryName	AKNA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Microtubule organization protein AKNA (AT-hook-containing transcription factor)
GeneName	AKNA KIAA1968
Length	384
Function	Centrosomal protein that plays a key role in cell delamination by regulating microtubule organization (By similarity). Required for the delamination and retention of neural stem cells from the subventricular zone during neurogenesis (By similarity). Also regulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in other epithelial cells (By similarity). Acts by increasing centrosomal microtubule nucleation and recruiting nucleation factors and minus-end stabilizers, thereby destabilizing microtubules at the adherens junctions and mediating constriction of the apical endfoot (By similarity). In addition, may also act as a transcription factor that specifically activates the expression of the CD40 receptor and its ligand CD40L/CD154, two cell surface molecules on lymphocytes that are critical for antigen-dependent-B-cell development (PubMed:11268217). Binds to A/T-rich promoters (PubMed:11268217). It is unclear how it can both act as a microtubule organizer and as a transcription factor; additional evidences are required to reconcile these two apparently contradictory functions (Probable).
