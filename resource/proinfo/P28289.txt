UniprotID	P28289
Accession	P28289;B2RB77;Q5T7W3;Q9BUF1
EntryName	TMOD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tropomodulin-1 (Erythrocyte tropomodulin) (E-Tmod)
GeneName	TMOD1 D9S57E TMOD
Length	359
Function	Blocks the elongation and depolymerization of the actin filaments at the pointed end (PubMed:38168645). The Tmod/TM complex contributes to the formation of the short actin protofilament, which in turn defines the geometry of the membrane skeleton. May play an important role in regulating the organization of actin filaments by preferentially binding to a specific tropomyosin isoform at its N-terminus.
