Length	431
Function	Synaptotagmin family member involved in vesicular and membrane trafficking which does not bind Ca(2+). Inhibits clathrin-mediated and bulk endocytosis, functions to ensure precision in vesicle retrieval. Plays an important role in dopamine transmission by regulating endocytosis and the vesicle-recycling process. Essential component of a neuronal vesicular trafficking pathway that differs from the synaptic vesicle trafficking pathway but is crucial for development and synaptic plasticity. In macrophages and microglia, inhibits the conventional cytokine secretion, of at least IL6 and TNF, and phagocytosis. In astrocytes, regulates lysosome exocytosis, mechanism required for the repair of injured astrocyte cell membrane (By similarity). Required for the ATP13A2-mediated regulation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway (PubMed:27278822).
