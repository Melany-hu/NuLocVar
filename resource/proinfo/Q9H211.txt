UniprotID	Q9H211
Accession	Q9H211;Q86XX9;Q96CJ5;Q96GK5;Q96H67;Q96HE6;Q9BWM0
EntryName	CDT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA replication factor Cdt1 (Double parked homolog) (DUP)
GeneName	CDT1
Length	546
Function	Required for both DNA replication and mitosis (PubMed:11125146, PubMed:14993212, PubMed:21856198, PubMed:22581055, PubMed:26842564). DNA replication licensing factor, required for pre-replication complex assembly. Cooperates with CDC6 and the origin recognition complex (ORC) during G1 phase of the cell cycle to promote the loading of the mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) complex onto DNA to generate pre-replication complexes (pre-RC) (PubMed:14672932). Required also for mitosis by promoting stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments (PubMed:22581055). Potential oncogene (By similarity).
