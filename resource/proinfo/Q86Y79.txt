UniprotID	Q86Y79
Accession	Q86Y79
EntryName	PTH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (PTH) (EC 3.1.1.29)
GeneName	PTRH1 C9orf115
Length	214
Function	Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase that cleaves nascent chains-tRNAs that are not stably fixed in the P-site of 60S ribosome-nascent chain complexes (PubMed:30244831). Acts downstream of the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway to release non-ubiquitinated nascent chains from 60S and 80S ribosome-nascent chain complexes (PubMed:30244831). Does not act on ubiquitinated nascent chains, which are cleaved by ANKZF1 for degradation (PubMed:30244831).
