UniprotID	Q9ULV8-2
Accession	Q9ULV8;Q8N1E5;Q9Y5Z2;Q9Y5Z3
EntryName	CBLC_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CBL-C (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 57) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase CBL-C) (SH3-binding protein CBL-3) (SH3-binding protein CBL-C) (Signal transduction protein CBL-C)
GeneName	CBLC CBL3 RNF57
Length	428
Function	Acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which accepts ubiquitin from specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and then transfers it to substrates promoting their degradation by the proteasome. Functionally coupled with the E2 ubiquitin-protein ligases UB2D1, UB2D2 and UB2D3. Regulator of EGFR mediated signal transduction; upon EGF activation, ubiquitinates EGFR. Isoform 1, but not isoform 2, inhibits EGF stimulated MAPK1 activation. Promotes ubiquitination of SRC phosphorylated at 'Tyr-419'. In collaboration with CD2AP may act as regulatory checkpoint for Ret signaling by modulating the rate of RET degradation after ligand activation; CD2AP converts it from an inhibitor to a promoter of RET degradation; the function limits the potency of GDNF on neuronal survival.
