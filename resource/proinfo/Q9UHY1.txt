UniprotID	Q9UHY1
Accession	Q9UHY1;B3KV40;D6W558;Q53FZ5;Q96SU3
EntryName	NRBP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear receptor-binding protein
GeneName	NRBP1 BCON3 NRBP
Length	535
Function	Required for embryonic development (By similarity). Plays a role in intestinal epithelial cell fate and proliferation, thereby involved in the architectural development of the intestine potentially via the regulation of Wnt-responsive genes (By similarity). May play a role in subcellular trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus through interactions with the Rho-type GTPases (PubMed:11956649). Binding to the NS3 protein of dengue virus type 2 appears to subvert this activity into the alteration of the intracellular membrane structure associated with flaviviral replication (PubMed:15084397).
