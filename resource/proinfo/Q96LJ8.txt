UniprotID	Q96LJ8
Accession	Q96LJ8;Q5R386
EntryName	UBX10_HUMAN
ProteinName	UBX domain-containing protein 10 (UBX domain-containing protein 3)
GeneName	UBXN10 UBXD3
Length	280
Function	VCP/p97-binding protein required for ciliogenesis (PubMed:26389662). Acts as a tethering factor that facilitates recruitment of VCP/p97 to the intraflagellar transport complex B (IFT-B) in cilia (PubMed:26389662). UBX domain-containing proteins act as tethering factors for VCP/p97 and may specify substrate specificity of VCP/p97 (PubMed:26389662).
