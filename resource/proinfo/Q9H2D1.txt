UniprotID	Q9H2D1
Accession	Q9H2D1;A0A024R9D0;Q96JZ6;Q96SU7
EntryName	S2532_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 25 member 32 (Mitochondrial FAD transporter)
GeneName	SLC25A32 MFT MFTC
Length	315
Function	Facilitates flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix where it acts as a redox cofactor to assist flavoenzyme activities in fundamental metabolic processes including fatty acid beta-oxidation, amino acid and choline metabolism as well as mitochondrial electron transportation. In particular, provides FAD to DLD dehydrogenase of the glycine cleavage system, part of mitochondrial one-carbon metabolic pathway involved in neural tube closure in early embryogenesis.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
