UniprotID	P51810
Accession	P51810;Q6NTI7
EntryName	GP143_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 143 (Ocular albinism type 1 protein)
GeneName	GPR143 OA1
Length	404
Function	Receptor for tyrosine, L-DOPA and dopamine. After binding to L-DOPA, stimulates Ca(2+) influx into the cytoplasm, increases secretion of the neurotrophic factor SERPINF1 and relocalizes beta arrestin at the plasma membrane; this ligand-dependent signaling occurs through a G(q)-mediated pathway in melanocytic cells. Its activity is mediated by G proteins which activate the phosphoinositide signaling pathway. Also plays a role as an intracellular G protein-coupled receptor involved in melanosome biogenesis, organization and transport.
Subcellular Location	Melanosome membrane; Lysosome membrane; Apical cell membrane
