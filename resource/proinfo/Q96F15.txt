UniprotID	Q96F15
Accession	Q96F15;D3DWZ5;Q6IA75;Q96NE4;Q9NUK9
EntryName	GIMA5_HUMAN
ProteinName	GTPase IMAP family member 5 (Immune-associated nucleotide-binding protein 5) (Immunity-associated nucleotide 4-like 1 protein) (Immunity-associated nucleotide 5 protein) (IAN-5) (hIAN5) (Immunity-associated protein 3)
GeneName	GIMAP5 IAN4L1 IAN5 IMAP3
Length	307
Function	Plays a role in T lymphocyte development and the optimal generation of CD4/CD8 double-positive thymocytes (By similarity). Inhibitor of GSK3A, possibly by sequestering GSK3A in cytoplasmic vesicles and impairing its translocation to the nucleus. Consequently, impairs GSK3A-dependent transcriptional program and regulation of the DNA damage response occurring during T cells proliferation (PubMed:29382851). Required for the survival of peripheral T cells, natural killer (NK) and NK T-cell development and the maintenance of normal liver function (By similarity). May promote the survival of mature T lymphocytes upon cytokine withdrawal (By similarity). May regulate Ca(2+) homeostasis by modulating lysosomal Ca(2+) stores, preventing its accumulation in the absence of T cell activation (By similarity). May play a role in mitochondrial DNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues (By similarity). Is a regulator of liver endothelial cell homeostasis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane; Endosome; Multivesicular body membrane; Endosome membrane
