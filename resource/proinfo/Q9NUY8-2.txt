Accession	Q9NUY8;B9A6M5;Q8TCN8;Q8WUB7;Q96D90;Q9NV75
EntryName	TBC23_HUMAN
ProteinName	TBC1 domain family member 23 (HCV non-structural protein 4A-transactivated protein 1)
GeneName	TBC1D23 NS4ATP1
Length	684
Function	Putative Rab GTPase-activating protein which plays a role in vesicular trafficking (PubMed:28823707). Involved in endosome-to-Golgi trafficking. Acts as a bridging protein by binding simultaneously to golgins, including GOLGA1 and GOLGA4, located at the trans-Golgi, and to the WASH complex, located on endosome-derived vesicles (PubMed:29084197, PubMed:29426865). Together with WDR11 complex facilitates the golgin-mediated capture of vesicles generated using AP-1 (PubMed:29426865). Plays a role in brain development, including in cortical neuron positioning (By similarity). May also be important for neurite outgrowth, possibly through its involvement in membrane trafficking and cargo delivery, 2 processes that are essential for axonal and dendritic growth (By similarity). May act as a general inhibitor of innate immunity signaling, strongly inhibiting multiple TLR and dectin/CLEC7A-signaling pathways. Does not alter initial activation events, but instead affects maintenance of inflammatory gene expression several hours after bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge (By similarity).
