Accession	Q7Z412;F6UBB5;Q7Z413;Q7Z414;Q7Z415;Q7Z416;Q96B12;Q9NWQ0;Q9NXU0
EntryName	PEX26_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisome assembly protein 26 (Peroxin-26)
GeneName	PEX26
Length	305
Function	Peroxisomal docking factor that anchors PEX1 and PEX6 to peroxisome membranes (PubMed:12717447, PubMed:12851857, PubMed:16257970, PubMed:16763195, PubMed:16854980, PubMed:21362118). PEX26 is therefore required for the formation of the PEX1-PEX6 AAA ATPase complex, a complex that mediates the extraction of the PEX5 receptor from peroxisomal membrane (PubMed:12717447, PubMed:12851857, PubMed:16257970, PubMed:16763195, PubMed:16854980, PubMed:21362118).
Subcellular Location	Peroxisome membrane
