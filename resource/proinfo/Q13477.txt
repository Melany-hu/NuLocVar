UniprotID	Q13477
Accession	Q13477;A5PKV4;B2RPL9;O60222;O75867;Q5UGI7
EntryName	MADCA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) (hMAdCAM-1)
GeneName	MADCAM1
Length	382
Function	Cell adhesion leukocyte receptor expressed by mucosal venules, helps to direct lymphocyte traffic into mucosal tissues including the Peyer patches and the intestinal lamina propria. It can bind both integrin alpha-4/beta-7 and L-selectin, regulating both the passage and retention of leukocytes. Isoform 2, lacking the mucin-like domain, may be specialized in supporting integrin alpha-4/beta-7-dependent adhesion strengthening, independent of L-selectin binding.
