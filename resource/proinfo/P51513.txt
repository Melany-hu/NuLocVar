UniprotID	P51513
Accession	P51513;A8K0S4;A8K4Q7;D3DS81;D3DS82;Q6B004
EntryName	NOVA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA-binding protein Nova-1 (Neuro-oncological ventral antigen 1) (Onconeural ventral antigen 1) (Paraneoplastic Ri antigen) (Ventral neuron-specific protein 1)
GeneName	NOVA1
Length	507
Function	Functions to regulate alternative splicing in neurons by binding pre-mRNA in a sequence-specific manner to activate exon inclusion or exclusion. It binds specifically to the sequences 5'-YCAY-3' and regulates splicing in only a subset of regulated exons (PubMed:10811881). Binding to an exonic 5'-YCAY-3' cluster changes the protein complexes assembled on pre-mRNA, blocking U1 snRNP binding and exon inclusion, whereas binding to an intronic 5'-YCAY-3' cluster enhances spliceosome assembly and exon inclusion. Binding to 5'-YCAY-3' clusters results in a local and asymmetric action to regulate spliceosome assembly and alternative splicing in neurons. Binding to an exonic 5'-YCAY-3' cluster changed the protein complexes assembled on pre-mRNA, blocking U1 snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein) binding and exon inclusion, whereas binding to an intronic 5'-YCAY-3' cluster enhanced spliceosome assembly and exon inclusion. With NOVA1, they perform unique biological functions in different brain areas and cell types. Autoregulates its own expression by acting as a splicing repressor. Acts to activate the inclusion of exon E3A in the glycine receptor alpha-2 chain and of exon E9 in gamma-aminobutyric-acid receptor gamma-2 subunit via a distal downstream UCAU-rich intronic splicing enhancer. Acts to regulate a novel glycine receptor alpha-2 chain splice variant (alpha-2N) in developing spinal cord (By similarity).
