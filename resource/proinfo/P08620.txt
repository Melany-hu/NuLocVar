UniprotID	P08620
Accession	P08620;B7U994
EntryName	FGF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF-4) (Heparin secretory-transforming protein 1) (HST) (HST-1) (HSTF-1) (Heparin-binding growth factor 4) (HBGF-4) (Transforming protein KS3)
GeneName	FGF4 HST HSTF1 KS3
Length	206
Function	Plays an important role in the regulation of embryonic development, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. Required for normal limb and cardiac valve development during embryogenesis. May play a role in embryonic molar tooth bud development via inducing the expression of MSX1, MSX2 and MSX1-mediated expression of SDC1 in dental mesenchyme cells (By similarity).
