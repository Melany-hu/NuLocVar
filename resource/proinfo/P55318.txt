UniprotID	P55318
Accession	P55318;A9LYI5;Q53F16;Q9UMW9
EntryName	FOXA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3-gamma (HNF-3-gamma) (HNF-3G) (Fork head-related protein FKH H3) (Forkhead box protein A3) (Transcription factor 3G) (TCF-3G)
GeneName	FOXA3 HNF3G TCF3G
Length	350
Function	Transcription factor that is thought to act as a 'pioneer' factor opening the compacted chromatin for other proteins through interactions with nucleosomal core histones and thereby replacing linker histones at target enhancer and/or promoter sites (By similarity). Originally described as a transcription activator for a number of liver genes such as AFP, albumin, tyrosine aminotransferase, PEPCK, etc. Interacts with the cis-acting regulatory regions of these genes. Involved in glucose homeostasis; binds to and activates transcription from the G6PC1 promoter. Binds to the CYP3A4 promoter and activates its transcription in cooperation with CEBPA. Binds to the CYP3A7 promoter together with members of the CTF/NF-I family. Involved in regulation of neuronal-specific transcription. May be involved in regulation of spermatogenesis.
