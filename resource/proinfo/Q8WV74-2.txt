UniprotID	Q8WV74-2
Accession	Q8WV74;Q6ZW59
EntryName	NUDT8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial coenzyme A diphosphatase NUDT8 (EC 3.6.1.-) (EC 3.6.1.77) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 8) (Nudix motif 8)
GeneName	NUDT8
Length	140
Function	Acyl-CoA diphosphatase that mediates the hydrolysis of a wide range of CoA and CoA esters yielding 3',5'-ADP and the corresponding 4'-phosphopantetheine derivative as products (By similarity). Hydrolyzes short- and medium-chain acyl-CoAs, exhibiting the highest activity toward free CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, and octanoyl-CoA and the lowest activity against acetyl-CoA (By similarity). Exhibits decapping activity towards dpCoA-capped RNAs in vitro (By similarity).
