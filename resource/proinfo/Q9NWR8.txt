UniprotID	Q9NWR8
Accession	Q9NWR8;A8K4Y3;Q6IAC1
EntryName	MCUB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium uniporter regulatory subunit MCUb, mitochondrial (MCUb) (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 109B)
GeneName	MCUB CCDC109B
Length	336
Function	Negative regulator of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), a channel that mediates calcium uptake into the mitochondrial matrix (PubMed:31533452). MCUB is required to limit mitochondrial calcium overload during stress (PubMed:31533452). Acts as a dominant-negative regulator that displaces MCU from the functional uniplex complex and thereby decreases the association of calcium sensors MICU1 and MICU2, preventing channel gating (PubMed:31533452). Mitochondrial calcium homeostasis plays key roles in mitochondrial metabolism (PubMed:31533452). Acts as an important regulator of mitochondrial metabolism in response to stress in muscle cells: induced in response to fasting, leading to restrict mitochondrial calcium uptake, resulting in reprogramming of mitochondria toward fatty acid oxidation preference (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of macrophage polarization during skeletal muscle regeneration: inhibition of mitochondrial calcium uptake drives differentiation of macrophages with anti-inflammatory profile, promoting the differentiation and fusion of satellite cells (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
