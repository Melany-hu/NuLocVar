EntryName	PARVB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-parvin (Affixin)
GeneName	PARVB CGI-56
Length	364
Function	Adapter protein that plays a role in integrin signaling via ILK and in activation of the GTPases CDC42 and RAC1 by guanine exchange factors, such as ARHGEF6. Is involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and formation of lamellipodia. Plays a role in cell adhesion, cell spreading, establishment or maintenance of cell polarity, and cell migration.
