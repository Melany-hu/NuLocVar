UniprotID	P01036
Accession	P01036;Q9UBI5;Q9UCS9
EntryName	CYTS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cystatin-S (Cystatin-4) (Cystatin-SA-III) (Salivary acidic protein 1)
GeneName	CST4
Length	141
Function	This protein strongly inhibits papain and ficin, partially inhibits stem bromelain and bovine cathepsin C, but does not inhibit porcine cathepsin B or clostripain. Papain is inhibited non-competitively.
