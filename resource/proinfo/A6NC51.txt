UniprotID	A6NC51
Accession	A6NC51;B7ZW71
EntryName	T150B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Modulator of macroautophagy TMEM150B (Protein DRAM-3) (Transmembrane protein 150B) (Transmembrane protein 224)
GeneName	TMEM150B TMEM224
Length	233
Function	Modulator of macroautophagy that causes accumulation of autophagosomes under basal conditions and enhances autophagic flux (PubMed:25929859). Represses cell death and promotes long-term clonogenic survival of cells grown in the absence of glucose in a macroautophagy-independent manner (PubMed:25929859). May have some role in extracellular matrix engulfment or growth factor receptor recycling, both of which can modulate cell survival (PubMed:25929859).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Endosome membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome membrane
