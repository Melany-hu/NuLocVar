EntryName	GRPR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) (GRP-preferring bombesin receptor)
GeneName	GRPR
Length	384
Function	Receptor for gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) (PubMed:1655761). Signals via association with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system, resulting in Akt phosphorylation. Contributes to the regulation of food intake. Contributes to the perception of prurient stimuli and transmission of itch signals in the spinal cord that promote scratching behavior, but does not play a role in the perception of pain. Contributes primarily to nonhistaminergic itch sensation. In one study, shown to act in the amygdala as part of an inhibitory network which inhibits memory specifically related to learned fear (By similarity). In another study, shown to contribute to disinhibition of glutamatergic cells in the auditory cortex via signaling on vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing cells which leads to enhanced auditory fear memories (By similarity). Contributes to the induction of sighing through signaling in the pre-Botzinger complex, a cluster of several thousand neurons in the ventrolateral medulla responsible for inspiration during respiratory activity (By similarity).
