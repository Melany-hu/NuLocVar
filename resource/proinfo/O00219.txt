UniprotID	O00219
Accession	O00219;A8K5T5;Q8WTZ0;Q9NYP0
EntryName	HYAS3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hyaluronan synthase 3 (EC 2.4.1.212) (Hyaluronate synthase 3) (Hyaluronic acid synthase 3) (HA synthase 3)
GeneName	HAS3
Length	553
Function	Catalyzes the addition of GlcNAc or GlcUA monosaccharides to the nascent hyaluronan polymer. Therefore, it is essential to hyaluronan synthesis a major component of most extracellular matrices that has a structural role in tissues architectures and regulates cell adhesion, migration and differentiation. This is one of three isoenzymes responsible for cellular hyaluronan synthesis.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane; Early endosome
