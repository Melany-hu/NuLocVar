UniprotID	Q05195
Accession	Q05195;B2R6V8;B7ZLI6;D6W5G2;Q6FI41
EntryName	MAD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Max dimerization protein 1 (Max dimerizer 1) (Protein MAD)
GeneName	MXD1 MAD
Length	221
Function	Component of a transcriptional repressor complex together with MAX (PubMed:8425218). In complex with MAX binds to the core DNA sequence 5'-CACTG-3' (PubMed:8425218). Antagonizes MYC transcriptional activity by competing with MYC for MAX binding (PubMed:8425218). Binds to the TERT promoter and represses telomerase expression, possibly by interfering with MYC binding (PubMed:12837246).
