UniprotID	Q8N6I4
Accession	Q8N6I4;J3KQ65;Q9Y4S5
EntryName	LYSET_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysosomal enzyme trafficking factor (GNPTAB cleavage and activity factor) (GCAF) (Transmembrane protein 251)
GeneName	LYSET C14orf109 TMEM251
Length	163
Function	Required for mannose-6-phosphate-dependent trafficking of lysosomal enzymes (PubMed:36074821, PubMed:36074822, PubMed:36096887). LYSET bridges GlcNAc-1-phosphate transferase (GNPTAB), to the membrane-bound transcription factor site-1 protease (MBTPS1), thus allowing proteolytic activation of the GNPTAB. GNPTAB is involved in the regulation of M6P-dependent Golgi-to-lysosome trafficking of lysosomal enzymes (PubMed:36074821, PubMed:36074822, PubMed:36096887). LYSET is thus an essential factor for maturation and delivery of lysosomal hydrolases (PubMed:36074822).
