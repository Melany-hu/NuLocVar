UniprotID	Q8TBC4
Accession	Q8TBC4;A6NLB5;A8K027;O76088;Q9NTU3
EntryName	UBA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 catalytic subunit (EC 6.2.1.64) (NEDD8-activating enzyme E1C) (Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1C) (Ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 3) (Ubiquitin-activating enzyme 3)
GeneName	UBA3 UBE1C
Length	463
Function	Catalytic subunit of the dimeric UBA3-NAE1 E1 enzyme. E1 activates NEDD8 by first adenylating its C-terminal glycine residue with ATP, thereafter linking this residue to the side chain of the catalytic cysteine, yielding a NEDD8-UBA3 thioester and free AMP. E1 finally transfers NEDD8 to the catalytic cysteine of UBE2M. Down-regulates steroid receptor activity. Necessary for cell cycle progression.
