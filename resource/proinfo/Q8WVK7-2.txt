UniprotID	Q8WVK7-2
Accession	Q8WVK7;A6NIL3;B3KPL3;E9PCB8
EntryName	SKA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Spindle and kinetochore-associated protein 2 (Protein FAM33A)
GeneName	SKA2 FAM33A
Length	75
Function	Component of the SKA1 complex, a microtubule-binding subcomplex of the outer kinetochore that is essential for proper chromosome segregation (PubMed:17093495, PubMed:19289083, PubMed:23085020). Required for timely anaphase onset during mitosis, when chromosomes undergo bipolar attachment on spindle microtubules leading to silencing of the spindle checkpoint (PubMed:17093495). The SKA1 complex is a direct component of the kinetochore-microtubule interface and directly associates with microtubules as oligomeric assemblies (PubMed:19289083). The complex facilitates the processive movement of microspheres along a microtubule in a depolymerization-coupled manner (PubMed:17093495, PubMed:19289083). In the complex, it is required for SKA1 localization (PubMed:19289083). Affinity for microtubules is synergistically enhanced in the presence of the ndc-80 complex and may allow the ndc-80 complex to track depolymerizing microtubules (PubMed:23085020).
