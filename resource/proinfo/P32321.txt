UniprotID	P32321
Accession	P32321;B2R836;D3DP49;D3DP50;Q5M7Z8;Q9BVD8
EntryName	DCTD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deoxycytidylate deaminase (EC 3.5.4.12) (dCMP deaminase)
GeneName	DCTD
Length	178
Function	Catalyzes the deamination of dCMP to dUMP, providing the nucleoside monophosphate substrate for the thymidylate synthase/TYMS (PubMed:7685356). Also, part of a nucleotide salvage pathway that eliminates epigenetically modified 5-hydroxymethyl-dCMP (hmdCMP) in a two-step process entailing deamination to cytotoxic 5-hydroxymethyl-dUMP (hmdUMP), followed by its hydrolysis into 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) and 2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate (deoxyribosephosphate) (PubMed:33833118). Catalyzes the first step in that pathway, the deamination of 5-hydroxymethyl-dCMP (hmdCMP) (PubMed:33833118).
