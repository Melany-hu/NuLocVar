ProteinName	Polyunsaturated fatty acid lipoxygenase ALOX15 (12/15-lipoxygenase) (Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, leukocyte-type) (12-LOX) (EC 1.13.11.31) (Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase) (15-LOX) (15-LOX-1) (EC 1.13.11.33) (Arachidonate omega-6 lipoxygenase) (Hepoxilin A3 synthase Alox15) (EC 1.13.11.-) (Linoleate 13S-lipoxygenase) (EC 1.13.11.12)
GeneName	ALOX15 LOG15
Length	662
Function	Non-heme iron-containing dioxygenase that catalyzes the stereo-specific peroxidation of free and esterified polyunsaturated fatty acids generating a spectrum of bioactive lipid mediators (PubMed:17052953, PubMed:1944593, PubMed:24282679, PubMed:25293588, PubMed:32404334, PubMed:8334154). It inserts peroxyl groups at C12 or C15 of arachidonate ((5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoate) producing both 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoate/12-HPETE and 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoate/15-HPETE (PubMed:17052953, PubMed:1944593, PubMed:24282679, PubMed:8334154). It may then act on 12-HPETE to produce hepoxilins, which may show pro-inflammatory properties (By similarity). Can also peroxidize linoleate ((9Z,12Z)-octadecadienoate) to 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoate/13-HPODE (PubMed:8334154). May participate in the sequential oxidations of DHA ((4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)-docosahexaenoate) to generate specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs)like resolvin D5 ((7S,17S)-diHPDHA) and (7S,14S)-diHPDHA, that actively down-regulate the immune response and have anti-aggregation properties with platelets (PubMed:32404334). Can convert epoxy fatty acids to hydroperoxy-epoxides derivatives followed by an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution leading to the formation of monocyclic endoperoxides (PubMed:25293588). Plays an important role during the maintenance of self-tolerance by peroxidizing membrane-bound phosphatidylethanolamine which can then signal the sorting process for clearance of apoptotic cells during inflammation and prevent an autoimmune response. In addition to its role in the immune and inflammatory responses, this enzyme may play a role in epithelial wound healing in the cornea through production of lipoxin A4 (LXA(4)) and docosahexaenoic acid-derived neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1; 10R,17S-HDHA), both lipid autacoids exhibit anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, it may regulate actin polymerization which is crucial for several biological processes such as the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. It is also implicated in the generation of endogenous ligands for peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR-gamma), hence modulating macrophage development and function. It may also exert a negative effect on skeletal development by regulating bone mass through this pathway. As well as participates in ER stress and downstream inflammation in adipocytes, pancreatic islets, and liver (By similarity). Finally, it is also involved in the cellular response to IL13/interleukin-13 (PubMed:21831839).
