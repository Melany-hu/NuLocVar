UniprotID	Q08257
Accession	Q08257;A6NN60;D3DQ76;Q53FT0;Q59EU7;Q5HYE7;Q6NSK9
EntryName	QOR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Quinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.5.5) (NADPH:quinone reductase) (Zeta-crystallin)
GeneName	CRYZ
Length	329
Function	Does not have alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Binds NADP and acts through a one-electron transfer process. Orthoquinones, such as 1,2-naphthoquinone or 9,10-phenanthrenequinone, are the best substrates (in vitro). May act in the detoxification of xenobiotics. Interacts with (AU)-rich elements (ARE) in the 3'-UTR of target mRNA species. Enhances the stability of mRNA coding for BCL2. NADPH binding interferes with mRNA binding.
