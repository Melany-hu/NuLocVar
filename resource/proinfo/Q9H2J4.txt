EntryName	PDCL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosducin-like protein 3 (HTPHLP) (PhPL3) (Viral IAP-associated factor 1) (VIAF-1)
GeneName	PDCL3 PhLP2A VIAF1
Length	239
Function	Acts as a chaperone for the angiogenic VEGF receptor KDR/VEGFR2, increasing its abundance by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:23792958, PubMed:26059764). Inhibits the folding activity of the chaperonin-containing T-complex (CCT) which leads to inhibition of cytoskeletal actin folding (PubMed:17429077). Acts as a chaperone during heat shock alongside HSP90 and HSP40/70 chaperone complexes (By similarity). Modulates the activation of caspases during apoptosis (PubMed:15371430).
