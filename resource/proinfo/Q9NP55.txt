UniprotID	Q9NP55
Accession	Q9NP55;A6XMV5;A8K9R3;E1P5M9;Q9NZT0
EntryName	BPIA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	BPI fold-containing family A member 1 (Lung-specific protein X) (Nasopharyngeal carcinoma-related protein) (Palate lung and nasal epithelium clone protein) (Secretory protein in upper respiratory tracts) (Short PLUNC1) (SPLUNC1) (Tracheal epithelium-enriched protein) (Von Ebner protein Hl)
GeneName	BPIFA1 LUNX NASG PLUNC SPLUNC1 SPURT UNQ787/PRO1606
Length	256
Function	Lipid-binding protein which shows high specificity for the surfactant phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) (PubMed:25223608). Plays a role in the innate immune responses of the upper airways (PubMed:23132494, PubMed:23499554). Reduces the surface tension in secretions from airway epithelia and inhibits the formation of biofilm by pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, such as P.aeruginosa and K.pneumoniae (PubMed:23132494, PubMed:23499554, PubMed:27145151). Negatively regulates proteolytic cleavage of SCNN1G, an event that is required for activation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), and thereby contributes to airway surface liquid homeostasis and proper clearance of mucus (PubMed:24043776, PubMed:24124190). Plays a role in the airway inflammatory response after exposure to irritants (PubMed:11425234). May attract macrophages and neutrophils (PubMed:23132494).
