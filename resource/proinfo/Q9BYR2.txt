UniprotID	Q9BYR2
Accession	Q9BYR2
EntryName	KRA45_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 4-5 (Keratin-associated protein 4.5) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 4.5)
GeneName	KRTAP4-5 KAP4.5 KRTAP4.5
Length	181
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
