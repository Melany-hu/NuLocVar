EntryName	PRPK_HUMAN
ProteinName	EKC/KEOPS complex subunit TP53RK (EC 3.6.-.-) (Atypical serine/threonine protein kinase TP53RK) (Nori-2) (TP53-regulating kinase) (EC 2.7.11.1) (p53-related protein kinase)
GeneName	TP53RK C20orf64 PRPK
Length	253
Function	Component of the EKC/KEOPS complex that is required for the formation of a threonylcarbamoyl group on adenosine at position 37 (t(6)A37) in tRNAs that read codons beginning with adenine (PubMed:22912744, PubMed:27903914). The complex is probably involved in the transfer of the threonylcarbamoyl moiety of threonylcarbamoyl-AMP (TC-AMP) to the N6 group of A37 (PubMed:22912744, PubMed:27903914). TP53RK has ATPase activity in the context of the EKC/KEOPS complex and likely plays a supporting role to the catalytic subunit OSGEP (By similarity). Atypical protein kinase that phosphorylates 'Ser-15' of p53/TP53 protein and may therefore participate in its activation (PubMed:11546806).
