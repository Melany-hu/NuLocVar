UniprotID	P42681
Accession	P42681;Q14220
EntryName	TXK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tyrosine-protein kinase TXK (EC 2.7.10.2) (Protein-tyrosine kinase 4) (Resting lymphocyte kinase)
GeneName	TXK PTK4 RLK
Length	527
Function	Non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a redundant role with ITK in regulation of the adaptive immune response. Regulates the development, function and differentiation of conventional T-cells and nonconventional NKT-cells. When antigen presenting cells (APC) activate T-cell receptor (TCR), a series of phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of TXK to the cell membrane, where it is phosphorylated at Tyr-420. Phosphorylation leads to TXK full activation. Also contributes to signaling from many receptors and participates in multiple downstream pathways, including regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Like ITK, can phosphorylate PLCG1, leading to its localization in lipid rafts and activation, followed by subsequent cleavage of its substrates. In turn, the endoplasmic reticulum releases calcium in the cytoplasm and the nuclear activator of activated T-cells (NFAT) translocates into the nucleus to perform its transcriptional duty. Plays a role in the positive regulation of IFNG transcription in T-helper 1 cells as part of an IFNG promoter-binding complex with PARP1 and EEF1A1 (PubMed:11859127, PubMed:17177976). Within the complex, phosphorylates both PARP1 and EEF1A1 (PubMed:17177976). Also phosphorylates key sites in LCP2 leading to the up-regulation of Th1 preferred cytokine IL-2. Phosphorylates 'Tyr-201' of CTLA4 which leads to the association of PI-3 kinase with the CTLA4 receptor.
