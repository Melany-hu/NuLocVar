UniprotID	O75832
Accession	O75832;Q5U0B2;Q8IZK9
EntryName	PSD10_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 10 (26S proteasome regulatory subunit p28) (Gankyrin) (p28(GANK))
GeneName	PSMD10
Length	226
Function	Acts as a chaperone during the assembly of the 26S proteasome, specifically of the PA700/19S regulatory complex (RC). In the initial step of the base subcomplex assembly is part of an intermediate PSMD10:PSMC4:PSMC5:PAAF1 module which probably assembles with a PSMD5:PSMC2:PSMC1:PSMD2 module. Independently of the proteasome, regulates EGF-induced AKT activation through inhibition of the RHOA/ROCK/PTEN pathway, leading to prolonged AKT activation. Plays an important role in RAS-induced tumorigenesis.
