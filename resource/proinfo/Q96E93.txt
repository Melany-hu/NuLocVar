UniprotID	Q96E93
Accession	Q96E93;B7ZAM2;O43198;O75613
EntryName	KLRG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (C-type lectin domain family 15 member A) (ITIM-containing receptor MAFA-L) (MAFA-like receptor) (Mast cell function-associated antigen)
GeneName	KLRG1 CLEC15A MAFA MAFAL
Length	195
Function	Plays an inhibitory role on natural killer (NK) cells and T-cell functions upon binding to their non-MHC ligands. May mediate missing self recognition by binding to a highly conserved site on classical cadherins, enabling it to monitor expression of E-cadherin/CDH1, N-cadherin/CDH2 and R-cadherin/CDH4 on target cells.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
