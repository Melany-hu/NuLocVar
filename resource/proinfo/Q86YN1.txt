UniprotID	Q86YN1
Accession	Q86YN1;A8K3U8;B0QZG4;Q96GF8;Q9Y3G1
EntryName	DOPP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dolichyldiphosphatase 1 (EC 3.6.1.43) (Dolichyl pyrophosphate phosphatase 1)
GeneName	DOLPP1 LSFR2
Length	238
Function	Required for efficient N-glycosylation. Necessary for maintaining optimal levels of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides. Hydrolyzes dolichyl pyrophosphate at a very high rate and dolichyl monophosphate at a much lower rate. Does not act on phosphatidate (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
