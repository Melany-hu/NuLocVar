UniprotID	Q9UNT1
Accession	Q9UNT1;Q5TZT8;Q96C33
EntryName	RBL2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rab-like protein 2B
GeneName	RABL2B
Length	228
Function	Small GTPase required for ciliation. Activated in a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-independent manner via its intrinsic GDP for GTP nucleotide exchange ability (PubMed:28625565). Involved in ciliary assembly by binding the intraflagellar transport (IFT) complex B from the large pool pre-docked at the base of the cilium and thus triggers its entry into the cilia (PubMed:28428259, PubMed:28625565).
