UniprotID	Q6ZYL4
Accession	Q6ZYL4;Q0P5V8
EntryName	TF2H5_HUMAN
ProteinName	General transcription factor IIH subunit 5 (General transcription factor IIH polypeptide 5) (TFB5 ortholog) (TFIIH basal transcription factor complex TTD-A subunit) (TFIIH subunit p8)
GeneName	GTF2H5 C6orf175 TTDA
Length	71
Function	Component of the general transcription and DNA repair factor IIH (TFIIH) core complex, which is involved in general and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (NER) of damaged DNA and, when complexed to CAK, in RNA transcription by RNA polymerase II. In NER, TFIIH acts by opening DNA around the lesion to allow the excision of the damaged oligonucleotide and its replacement by a new DNA fragment. In transcription, TFIIH has an essential role in transcription initiation. When the pre-initiation complex (PIC) has been established, TFIIH is required for promoter opening and promoter escape. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II by the kinase module CAK controls the initiation of transcription. Necessary for the stability of the TFIIH complex and for the presence of normal levels of TFIIH in the cell.
