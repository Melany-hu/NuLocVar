UniprotID	P19388
Accession	P19388;B2R6L4;D6W5Y1;O43380;Q6PIH5;Q9BT06
EntryName	RPAB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerases I, II, and III subunit RPABC1 (RNA polymerases I, II, and III subunit ABC1) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase II 23 kDa polypeptide) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit E) (RPB5 homolog) (XAP4)
GeneName	POLR2E
Length	210
Function	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Common component of RNA polymerases I, II and III which synthesize ribosomal RNA precursors, mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs, and small RNAs, such as 5S rRNA and tRNAs, respectively. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Pols are composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. In Pol II, POLR2E/RPABC1 is part of the lower jaw surrounding the central large cleft and thought to grab the incoming DNA template.
