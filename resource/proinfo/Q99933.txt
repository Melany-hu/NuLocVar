EntryName	BAG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 1 (BAG-1) (Bcl-2-associated athanogene 1)
GeneName	BAG1 HAP
Length	345
Function	Co-chaperone for HSP70 and HSC70 chaperone proteins. Acts as a nucleotide-exchange factor (NEF) promoting the release of ADP from the HSP70 and HSC70 proteins thereby triggering client/substrate protein release. Nucleotide release is mediated via its binding to the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of HSPA8/HSC70 where as the substrate release is mediated via its binding to the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of HSPA8/HSC70 (PubMed:24318877, PubMed:27474739, PubMed:9873016). Inhibits the pro-apoptotic function of PPP1R15A, and has anti-apoptotic activity (PubMed:12724406). Markedly increases the anti-cell death function of BCL2 induced by various stimuli (PubMed:9305631). Involved in the STUB1-mediated proteasomal degradation of ESR1 in response to age-related circulating estradiol (17-beta-estradiol/E2) decline, thereby promotes neuronal apoptosis in response to ischemic reperfusion injury (By similarity).
