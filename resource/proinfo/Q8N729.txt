UniprotID	Q8N729
Accession	Q8N729
EntryName	NPW_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuropeptide W (Preproprotein L8) (hPPL8) [Cleaved into: Neuropeptide W-23 (NPW23) (hL8); Neuropeptide W-30 (NPW30) (hL8C)]
GeneName	NPW PPL8 PPNPW
Length	165
Function	Plays a regulatory role in the organization of neuroendocrine signals accessing the anterior pituitary gland. Stimulates water drinking and food intake. May play a role in the hypothalamic response to stress (By similarity). NPW23 activates GPR7 and GPR8 more efficiently than NPW30.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
