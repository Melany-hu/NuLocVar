EntryName	DCNL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	DCN1-like protein 1 (DCNL1) (DCUN1 domain-containing protein 1) (Defective in cullin neddylation protein 1-like protein 1) (Squamous cell carcinoma-related oncogene)
GeneName	DCUN1D1 DCN1 DCUN1L1 RP42 SCCRO
Length	259
Function	Part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for neddylation (PubMed:18826954). Promotes neddylation of cullin components of E3 cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complexes (PubMed:19617556, PubMed:23201271, PubMed:23401859, PubMed:26906416). Acts by binding to cullin-RBX1 complexes in the cytoplasm and promoting their nuclear translocation, enhancing recruitment of E2-NEDD8 (UBE2M-NEDD8) thioester to the complex, and optimizing the orientation of proteins in the complex to allow efficient transfer of NEDD8 from the E2 to the cullin substrates. Involved in the release of inhibitory effets of CAND1 on cullin-RING ligase E3 complex assembly and activity (PubMed:25349211, PubMed:28581483). Also acts as an oncogene facilitating malignant transformation and carcinogenic progression (By similarity).
