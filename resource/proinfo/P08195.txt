UniprotID	P08195
Accession	P08195;J3KPF3;Q13543
EntryName	4F2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Amino acid transporter heavy chain SLC3A2 (4F2 cell-surface antigen heavy chain) (4F2hc) (4F2 heavy chain antigen) (Lymphocyte activation antigen 4F2 large subunit) (Solute carrier family 3 member 2) (CD antigen CD98)
GeneName	SLC3A2 MDU1
Length	630
Function	Acts as a chaperone that facilitates biogenesis and trafficking of functional transporters heterodimers to the plasma membrane. Forms heterodimer with SLC7 family transporters (SLC7A5, SLC7A6, SLC7A7, SLC7A8, SLC7A10 and SLC7A11), a group of amino-acid antiporters (PubMed:10574970, PubMed:10903140, PubMed:11557028, PubMed:30867591, PubMed:33298890, PubMed:33758168, PubMed:34880232, PubMed:9751058, PubMed:9829974, PubMed:9878049). Heterodimers function as amino acids exchangers, the specificity of the substrate depending on the SLC7A subunit. Heterodimers SLC3A2/SLC7A6 or SLC3A2/SLC7A7 mediate the uptake of dibasic amino acids (PubMed:10903140, PubMed:9829974). Heterodimer SLC3A2/SLC7A11 functions as an antiporter by mediating the exchange of extracellular anionic L-cystine and intracellular L-glutamate across the cellular plasma membrane (PubMed:34880232). SLC3A2/SLC7A10 translocates small neutral L- and D-amino acids across the plasma membrane (By similarity). SLC3A2/SLC75 or SLC3A2/SLC7A8 translocates neutral amino acids with broad specificity, thyroid hormones and L-DOPA (PubMed:10574970, PubMed:11389679, PubMed:11557028, PubMed:11564694, PubMed:11742812, PubMed:12117417, PubMed:12225859, PubMed:12716892, PubMed:15980244, PubMed:30867591, PubMed:33298890, PubMed:33758168). SLC3A2 is essential for plasma membrane localization, stability, and the transport activity of SLC7A5 and SLC7A8 (PubMed:10391915, PubMed:10574970, PubMed:11311135, PubMed:15769744, PubMed:33066406). When associated with LAPTM4B, the heterodimer SLC7A5 is recruited to lysosomes to promote leucine uptake into these organelles, and thereby mediates mTORC1 activation (PubMed:25998567). Modulates integrin-related signaling and is essential for integrin-dependent cell spreading, migration and tumor progression (PubMed:11121428, PubMed:15625115).
