UniprotID	O75251
Accession	O75251;B3KRI2;Q2T9H7;Q9BV17
EntryName	NDUS7_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 7, mitochondrial (EC 7.1.1.2) (Complex I-20kD) (CI-20kD) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 20 kDa subunit) (PSST subunit)
GeneName	NDUFS7
Length	213
Function	Core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) which catalyzes electron transfer from NADH through the respiratory chain, using ubiquinone as an electron acceptor (PubMed:17275378). Essential for the catalytic activity of complex I (PubMed:17275378).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
