UniprotID	P60014
Accession	P60014
EntryName	KR10A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 10-10 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.10) (Keratin-associated protein 10.10) (Keratin-associated protein 18-10) (Keratin-associated protein 18.10)
GeneName	KRTAP10-10 KAP10.10 KAP18-10 KRTAP10.10 KRTAP18-1 KRTAP18.10
Length	251
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
