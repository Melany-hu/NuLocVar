UniprotID	Q9BRX8
Accession	Q9BRX8;B2RD81;Q6UW08;Q8N2K3;Q8NBK9;Q96JR0
EntryName	PXL2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxiredoxin-like 2A (Peroxiredoxin-like 2 activated in M-CSF stimulated monocytes) (Protein PAMM) (Redox-regulatory protein FAM213A)
GeneName	PRXL2A C10orf58 FAM213A PAMM PRO2290 PSEC0139 UNQ611/PRO1198
Length	229
Function	Involved in redox regulation of the cell (PubMed:19951071, PubMed:26438880). Acts as an antioxidant (PubMed:19951071, PubMed:26438880). Inhibits TNFSF11-induced NFKB1 and JUN activation and osteoclast differentiation (PubMed:19951071). May affect bone resorption and help to maintain bone mass (PubMed:19951071). Acts as a negative regulator of macrophage-mediated inflammation by inhibiting macrophage production of inflammatory cytokines, probably through suppression of the MAPK signaling pathway (PubMed:26438880).
