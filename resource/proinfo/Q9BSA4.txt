UniprotID	Q9BSA4
Accession	Q9BSA4;B3KX97;Q3B7H8;Q3B7R9;Q6AWB4;Q8NBB7;Q96PK1
EntryName	TTYH2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein tweety homolog 2 (hTTY2) (Volume-regulated anion channel subunit TTYH2)
GeneName	TTYH2 C17orf29
Length	534
Function	Calcium-independent, swelling-dependent volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC-swell) which plays a pivotal role in the process of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in the brain through the efflux of anions like chloride and organic osmolytes like glutamate (By similarity). Probable large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated chloride channel (PubMed:15010458).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
