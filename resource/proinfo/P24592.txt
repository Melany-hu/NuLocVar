UniprotID	P24592
Accession	P24592;Q14492
EntryName	IBP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6 (IBP-6) (IGF-binding protein 6) (IGFBP-6)
GeneName	IGFBP6 IBP6
Length	240
Function	IGF-binding proteins prolong the half-life of the IGFs and have been shown to either inhibit or stimulate the growth promoting effects of the IGFs on cell culture. They alter the interaction of IGFs with their cell surface receptors. Activates the MAPK signaling pathway and induces cell migration (PubMed:24003225).
