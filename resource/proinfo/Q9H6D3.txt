EntryName	XKR8_HUMAN
ProteinName	XK-related protein 8 (hXkr8) [Cleaved into: XK-related protein 8, processed form]
GeneName	XKR8 XRG8
Length	395
Function	Phospholipid scramblase that promotes phosphatidylserine exposure on apoptotic cell surface (PubMed:23845944, PubMed:25231987). Phosphatidylserine is a specific marker only present at the surface of apoptotic cells and acts as a specific signal for engulfment (PubMed:23845944). Required for the clearance of apoptotic cells, such as engulfment of apoptotic germ cells by Sertoli cells, clearance of senescent neutrophils or regulation of bipolar cell numbers in the retina (By similarity). Has no effect on calcium-induced exposure of phosphatidylserine (PubMed:23845944). Promotes myoblast differentiation and survival (PubMed:28881496).
