EntryName	ANXA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Annexin A2 (Annexin II) (Annexin-2) (Calpactin I heavy chain) (Calpactin-1 heavy chain) (Chromobindin-8) (Lipocortin II) (Placental anticoagulant protein IV) (PAP-IV) (Protein I) (p36)
GeneName	ANXA2 ANX2 ANX2L4 CAL1H LPC2D
Length	339
Function	Calcium-regulated membrane-binding protein whose affinity for calcium is greatly enhanced by anionic phospholipids. It binds two calcium ions with high affinity. May be involved in heat-stress response. Inhibits PCSK9-enhanced LDLR degradation, probably reduces PCSK9 protein levels via a translational mechanism but also competes with LDLR for binding with PCSK9 (PubMed:18799458, PubMed:22848640, PubMed:24808179).
