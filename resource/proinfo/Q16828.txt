EntryName	DUS6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity protein phosphatase 6 (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.48) (Dual specificity protein phosphatase PYST1) (Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 3) (MAP kinase phosphatase 3) (MKP-3)
GeneName	DUSP6 MKP3 PYST1
Length	381
Function	Inactivates MAP kinases. Has a specificity for the ERK family (PubMed:9858808). Plays an important role in alleviating chronic postoperative pain. Necessary for the normal dephosphorylation of the long-lasting phosphorylated forms of spinal MAPK1/3 and MAP kinase p38 induced by peripheral surgery, which drives the resolution of acute postoperative allodynia (By similarity). Also important for dephosphorylation of MAPK1/3 in local wound tissue, which further contributes to resolution of acute pain (By similarity). Promotes cell differentiation by regulating MAPK1/MAPK3 activity and regulating the expression of AP1 transcription factors (PubMed:29043977).
