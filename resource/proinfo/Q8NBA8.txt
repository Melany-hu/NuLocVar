UniprotID	Q8NBA8
Accession	Q8NBA8;J3KND6
EntryName	DTWD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA-uridine aminocarboxypropyltransferase 2 (EC 2.5.1.25) (DTW domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	DTWD2
Length	298
Function	Catalyzes the formation of 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)uridine (acp3U) at position 20a in the D-loop of several cytoplasmic tRNAs (acp3U(20a)) (PubMed:31804502, PubMed:39173631). Also has a weak activity to form acp3U at position 20 in the D-loop of tRNAs (acp3U(20)) (PubMed:31804502). Involved in glycoRNA biosynthesis by mediating formation of acp3U, which acts as an attachment site for N-glycans on tRNAs (PubMed:39173631). GlycoRNAs consist of RNAs modified with secretory N-glycans that are presented on the cell surface (PubMed:39173631).
