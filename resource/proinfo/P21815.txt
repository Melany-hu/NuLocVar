UniprotID	P21815
Accession	P21815
EntryName	SIAL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Integrin-binding sialoprotein (Bone sialoprotein 2) (Bone sialoprotein II) (BSP II) (Cell-binding sialoprotein)
GeneName	IBSP BNSP
Length	317
Function	Binds tightly to hydroxyapatite (PubMed:11459848). Appears to form an integral part of the mineralized matrix (PubMed:1818768). Probably important to cell-matrix interaction (PubMed:1818768). Promotes adhesion and migration of various cells via the alpha-V/beta-3 integrin receptor (ITGAV:ITGB3) (PubMed:10640428, PubMed:11459848, PubMed:24103036).
