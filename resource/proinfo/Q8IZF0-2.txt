EntryName	NALCN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium leak channel NALCN (CanIon) (Sodium leak channel non-selective protein) (Voltage gated channel-like protein 1)
GeneName	NALCN VGCNL1
Length	668
Function	Voltage-gated ion channel responsible for the resting Na(+) permeability that controls neuronal excitability (PubMed:17448995, PubMed:31409833). NALCN channel functions as a multi-protein complex, which consists at least of NALCN, NALF1, UNC79 and UNC80 (PubMed:32494638, PubMed:33203861). NALCN is the voltage-sensing, pore-forming subunit of the NALCN channel complex (PubMed:17448995). NALCN channel complex is constitutively active and conducts monovalent cations but is blocked by physiological concentrations of extracellular divalent cations (PubMed:32494638). In addition to its role in regulating neuronal excitability, is required for normal respiratory rhythm, systemic osmoregulation by controlling the serum sodium concentration and in the regulation of the intestinal pace-making activity in the interstitial cells of Cajal (By similarity). NALCN channel is also activated by neuropeptides such as neurotensin and substance P (SP) through a SRC family kinases-dependent pathway (By similarity). In addition, NALCN activity is enhanced/modulated by several GPCRs, such as CHRM3 (By similarity).
