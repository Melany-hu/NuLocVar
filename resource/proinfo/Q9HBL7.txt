UniprotID	Q9HBL7
Accession	Q9HBL7;B2R6W0;Q9NZ44
EntryName	PLRKT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Plasminogen receptor (KT) (Plg-R(KT))
GeneName	PLGRKT C9orf46 AD025 MDS030
Length	147
Function	Receptor for plasminogen. Regulates urokinase plasminogen activator-dependent and stimulates tissue-type plasminogen activator-dependent cell surface plasminogen activation. Proposed to be part of a local catecholaminergic cell plasminogen activation system that regulates neuroendocrine prohormone processing. Involved in regulation of inflammatory response; regulates monocyte chemotactic migration and matrix metalloproteinase activation, such as of MMP2 and MMP9.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
