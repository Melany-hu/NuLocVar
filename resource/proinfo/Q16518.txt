EntryName	RPE65_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinoid isomerohydrolase (EC 3.1.1.64) (All-trans-retinyl-palmitate hydrolase) (Lutein isomerase) (Meso-zeaxanthin isomerase) (EC 5.3.3.22) (Retinal pigment epithelium-specific 65 kDa protein) (Retinol isomerase)
GeneName	RPE65
Length	533
Function	Critical isomerohydrolase in the retinoid cycle involved in regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of rod and cone opsins. Catalyzes the cleavage and isomerization of all-trans-retinyl fatty acid esters to 11-cis-retinol which is further oxidized by 11-cis retinol dehydrogenase to 11-cis-retinal for use as visual chromophore (PubMed:16116091). Essential for the production of 11-cis retinal for both rod and cone photoreceptors (PubMed:17848510). Also capable of catalyzing the isomerization of lutein to meso-zeaxanthin an eye-specific carotenoid (PubMed:28874556). The soluble form binds vitamin A (all-trans-retinol), making it available for LRAT processing to all-trans-retinyl ester. The membrane form, palmitoylated by LRAT, binds all-trans-retinyl esters, making them available for IMH (isomerohydrolase) processing to all-cis-retinol. The soluble form is regenerated by transferring its palmitoyl groups onto 11-cis-retinol, a reaction catalyzed by LRAT (By similarity).
