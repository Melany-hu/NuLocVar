UniprotID	Q9Y3C4
Accession	Q9Y3C4;D6W5H6;Q8IWR6;Q8IWR7;Q9H3K4
EntryName	TPRKB_HUMAN
ProteinName	EKC/KEOPS complex subunit TPRKB (PRPK-binding protein) (TP53RK-binding protein)
GeneName	TPRKB CGI-121 My019
Length	175
Function	Component of the EKC/KEOPS complex that is required for the formation of a threonylcarbamoyl group on adenosine at position 37 (t(6)A37) in tRNAs that read codons beginning with adenine (PubMed:22912744, PubMed:28805828). The complex is probably involved in the transfer of the threonylcarbamoyl moiety of threonylcarbamoyl-AMP (TC-AMP) to the N6 group of A37 (PubMed:22912744, PubMed:28805828). TPRKB acts as an allosteric effector that regulates the t(6)A activity of the complex. TPRKB is not required for tRNA modification (PubMed:22912744, PubMed:28805828).
