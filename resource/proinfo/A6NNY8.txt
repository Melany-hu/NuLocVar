UniprotID	A6NNY8
Accession	A6NNY8
EntryName	UBP27_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 27 (EC 3.4.19.12) (Deubiquitinating enzyme 27) (Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 22-like) (Ubiquitin thioesterase 27) (Ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 27) (X-linked ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 27)
GeneName	USP27X USP22L USP27
Length	438
Function	Deubiquitinase involved in innate antiviral immunity by mediating deubiquitination of CGAS and RIGI (PubMed:31534008, PubMed:32027733). Negatively regulates RIGI by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked deubiquitination of RIGI, inhibiting type I interferon signaling (PubMed:32027733). Also regulates 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination level of MDA5/IFIH1 (PubMed:32027733). Acts as a positive regulator of the cGAS-STING pathway by catalyzing 'Lys-48'-linked deubiquitination of CGAS, thereby promoting its stabilization (PubMed:31534008). Can reduce the levels of BCL2L11/BIM ubiquitination and stabilize BCL2L11 in response to the RAF-MAPK-degradation signal (By similarity). By acting on BCL2L11 levels, may counteract the anti-apoptotic effects of MAPK activity (By similarity).
