UniprotID	P32119
Accession	P32119;A8K0C0;P31945;P32118;P35701;Q6FHG4;Q92763;Q9UC23
EntryName	PRDX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxiredoxin-2 (EC 1.11.1.24) (Natural killer cell-enhancing factor B) (NKEF-B) (PRP) (Thiol-specific antioxidant protein) (TSA) (Thioredoxin peroxidase 1) (Thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase 1) (Thioredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxin 2)
GeneName	PRDX2 NKEFB TDPX1
Length	198
Function	Thiol-specific peroxidase that catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water and alcohols, respectively. Plays a role in cell protection against oxidative stress by detoxifying peroxides and as sensor of hydrogen peroxide-mediated signaling events. Might participate in the signaling cascades of growth factors and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by regulating the intracellular concentrations of H(2)O(2).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
