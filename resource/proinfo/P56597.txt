UniprotID	P56597
Accession	P56597;B2R5G7
EntryName	NDK5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleoside diphosphate kinase homolog 5 (NDK-H 5) (NDP kinase homolog 5) (3'-5' exonuclease NME5) (EC 3.1.-.-) (Inhibitor of p53-induced apoptosis-beta) (IPIA-beta) (Testis-specific nm23 homolog) (nm23-H5)
GeneName	NME5
Length	212
Function	Functions as part of axonemal radial spoke complexes that play an important part in the motility of sperm and cilia. Does not seem to have nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) activity (PubMed:9742940). Confers protection from cell death by BAX and alters the cellular levels of several antioxidant enzymes including GPX5. May play a role in spermiogenesis by increasing the ability of late-stage spermatids to eliminate reactive oxygen species (By similarity). Exhibits a 3'-5' exonuclease activity with a preference for single-stranded DNA, suggesting roles in DNA proofreading and repair (PubMed:16313181).
Subcellular Location	Cell projection; Cilium; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Flagellum axoneme
