UniprotID	P19404
Accession	P19404;Q9BV41
EntryName	NDUV2_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] flavoprotein 2, mitochondrial (NDUFV2) (EC 7.1.1.2) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 24 kDa subunit)
GeneName	NDUFV2
Length	249
Function	Core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) which catalyzes electron transfer from NADH through the respiratory chain, using ubiquinone as an electron acceptor (Probable). Parts of the peripheral arm of the enzyme, where the electrons from NADH are accepted by flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and then passed along a chain of iron-sulfur clusters by electron tunnelling to the final acceptor ubiquinone (Probable). Contains one iron-sulfur cluster (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
