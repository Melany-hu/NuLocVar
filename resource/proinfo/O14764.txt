EntryName	GBRD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit delta (GABA(A) receptor subunit delta) (GABAAR subunit delta)
GeneName	GABRD
Length	452
Function	Delta subunit of the heteropentameric ligand-gated chloride channel gated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain (PubMed:35355020). GABA-gated chloride channels, also named GABA(A) receptors (GABAAR), consist of five subunits arranged around a central pore and contain GABA active binding site(s) located at the alpha and beta subunit interface(s) (PubMed:35355020). When activated by GABA, GABAARs selectively allow the flow of chloride anions across the cell membrane down their electrochemical gradient (PubMed:35355020). GABAARs containing delta/GABRD subunits are predominantly located in extrasynaptic or perisynaptic positions on hippocampus and cerebellar granule cells, and contribute to the tonic GABAergic inhibition (By similarity). GABAAR containing alpha-4-beta-3-delta subunits can simultaneously bind GABA and histamine where histamine binds at the interface of two neighboring beta subunits, which may be involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness (PubMed:35355020).
