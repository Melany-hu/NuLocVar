UniprotID	Q08334
Accession	Q08334;Q9BUU4
EntryName	I10R2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-10 receptor subunit beta (IL-10 receptor subunit beta) (IL-10R subunit beta) (IL-10RB) (Cytokine receptor class-II member 4) (Cytokine receptor family 2 member 4) (CRF2-4) (Interleukin-10 receptor subunit 2) (IL-10R subunit 2) (IL-10R2) (CD antigen CDw210b)
GeneName	IL10RB CRFB4 D21S58 D21S66
Length	325
Function	Shared cell surface receptor required for the activation of five class 2 cytokines: IL10, IL22, IL26, IL28, and IFNL1. The IFNLR1/IL10RB dimer is a receptor for the cytokine ligands IFNL2 and IFNL3 and mediates their antiviral activity. The ligand/receptor complex stimulate the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway leading to the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), which contribute to the antiviral state.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
