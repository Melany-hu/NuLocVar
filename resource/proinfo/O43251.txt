EntryName	RFOX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA binding protein fox-1 homolog 2 (Fox-1 homolog B) (Hexaribonucleotide-binding protein 2) (RNA-binding motif protein 9) (RNA-binding protein 9) (Repressor of tamoxifen transcriptional activity)
GeneName	RBFOX2 FOX2 HRNBP2 RBM9 RTA
Length	390
Function	RNA-binding protein that regulates alternative splicing events by binding to 5'-UGCAUGU-3' elements. Prevents binding of U2AF2 to the 3'-splice site. Regulates alternative splicing of tissue-specific exons and of differentially spliced exons during erythropoiesis (By similarity). RNA-binding protein that seems to act as a coregulatory factor of ER-alpha. Together with RNA binding proteins RBPMS and MBNL1/2, activates vascular smooth muscle cells alternative splicing events (PubMed:37548402).
