UniprotID	Q969J3
Accession	Q969J3;Q96QS5
EntryName	BORC5_HUMAN
ProteinName	BLOC-1-related complex subunit 5 (Loss of heterozygosity 12 chromosomal region 1) (Myristoylated lysosomal protein) (Myrlysin)
GeneName	BORCS5 LOH12CR1
Length	196
Function	As part of the BORC complex may play a role in lysosomes movement and localization at the cell periphery. Associated with the cytosolic face of lysosomes, the BORC complex may recruit ARL8B and couple lysosomes to microtubule plus-end-directed kinesin motor. Thereby, it may indirectly play a role in cell spreading and motility.
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane
