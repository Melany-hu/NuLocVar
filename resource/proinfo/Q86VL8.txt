UniprotID	Q86VL8
Accession	Q86VL8;A0JBX9;A0P8Z7;Q63HJ9;Q8IV44;Q96NA1
EntryName	S47A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 2 (MATE-2) (hMATE-2) (Kidney-specific H(+)/organic cation antiporter) (Solute carrier family 47 member 2)
GeneName	SLC47A2 MATE2
Length	602
Function	Multidrug efflux pump that functions as a H(+)/organic cation antiporter. Mediates the efflux of cationic compounds, such as the model cations, tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), the platinum-based drug oxaliplatin or weak bases that are positively charged at physiological pH, cimetidine, the platinum-based drugs cisplatin and oxaliplatin or the antidiabetic drug metformin. Mediates the efflux of endogenous compounds such as, creatinine, thiamine and estrone-3-sulfate. Plays a physiological role in the excretion of drugs, toxins and endogenous metabolites through the kidney.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Apical cell membrane; Apical cell membrane
