UniprotID	A6NG13
Accession	A6NG13
EntryName	MGT4D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-1,3-mannosyl-glycoprotein 4-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-like protein MGAT4D (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase MGAT1 inhibitory protein) (GlcNAcT-I inhibitory protein) (GnT1IP)
GeneName	MGAT4D
Length	374
Function	May play a role in male spermatogenesis. In vitro acts as inhibitor of MGAT1 activity causing cell surface proteins to carry mainly high mannose N-glycans. The function is mediated by its lumenal domain and occurs specifically in the Golgi. A catalytic glucosyltransferase activity is not detected. May be involved in regulation of Sertoli-germ cell interactions during specific stages of spermatogenesis.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
