UniprotID	Q5VWW1
Accession	Q5VWW1;A0PJY4;A0PJY5
EntryName	C1QL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complement C1q-like protein 3 (C1q and tumor necrosis factor-related protein 13) (C1q/TNF-related protein 13)
GeneName	C1QL3 CTRP13
Length	255
Function	May regulate the number of excitatory synapses that are formed on hippocampus neurons. Has no effect on inhibitory synapses (By similarity). Plays a role in glucose homeostasis. Via AMPK signaling pathway, stimulates glucose uptake in adipocytes, myotubes and hepatocytes and enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In a hepatoma cell line, reduces the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes G6PC1 and PCK1 and hence decreases de novo glucose production (By similarity).
