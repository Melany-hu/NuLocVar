UniprotID	Q9H9C1
Accession	Q9H9C1;B4DPI6;O95434;Q9H7E1;Q9H9I9
EntryName	SPE39_HUMAN
ProteinName	Spermatogenesis-defective protein 39 homolog (hSPE-39) (VPS33B-interacting protein in apical-basolateral polarity regulator) (VPS33B-interacting protein in polarity and apical restriction)
GeneName	VIPAS39 C14orf133 SPE39 VIPAR
Length	493
Function	Proposed to be involved in endosomal maturation implicating in part VPS33B. In epithelial cells, the VPS33B:VIPAS39 complex may play a role in the apical RAB11A-dependent recycling pathway and in the maintenance of the apical-basolateral polarity (PubMed:20190753). May play a role in lysosomal trafficking, probably via association with the core HOPS complex in a discrete population of endosomes; the functions seems to be independent of VPS33B (PubMed:19109425). May play a role in vesicular trafficking during spermatogenesis (By similarity). May be involved in direct or indirect transcriptional regulation of E-cadherin (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Early endosome; Recycling endosome; Late endosome
