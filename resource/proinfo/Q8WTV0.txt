UniprotID	Q8WTV0
Accession	Q8WTV0;F8W8N0;Q14016;Q52LZ5;Q6KFX4
EntryName	SCRB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SRB1) (CD36 and LIMPII analogous 1) (CLA-1) (CD36 antigen-like 1) (Collagen type I receptor, thrombospondin receptor-like 1) (SR-BI) (CD antigen CD36)
GeneName	SCARB1 CD36L1 CLA1
Length	552
Function	Receptor for different ligands such as phospholipids, cholesterol ester, lipoproteins, phosphatidylserine and apoptotic cells (PubMed:12016218, PubMed:12519372, PubMed:21226579). Receptor for HDL, mediating selective uptake of cholesteryl ether and HDL-dependent cholesterol efflux (PubMed:26965621). Also facilitates the flux of free and esterified cholesterol between the cell surface and apoB-containing lipoproteins and modified lipoproteins, although less efficiently than HDL. May be involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, via its phosphatidylserine binding activity (PubMed:12016218).
