EntryName	SLU7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pre-mRNA-splicing factor SLU7 (hSlu7)
GeneName	SLU7
Length	586
Function	Required for pre-mRNA splicing as component of the spliceosome (PubMed:10197984, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:30705154). Participates in the second catalytic step of pre-mRNA splicing, when the free hydroxyl group of exon I attacks the 3'-splice site to generate spliced mRNA and the excised lariat intron. Required for holding exon 1 properly in the spliceosome and for correct AG identification when more than one possible AG exists in 3'-splicing site region. May be involved in the activation of proximal AG. Probably also involved in alternative splicing regulation.
