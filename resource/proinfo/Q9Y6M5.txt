EntryName	ZNT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proton-coupled zinc antiporter SLC30A1 (Solute carrier family 30 member 1) (Zinc transporter 1)
GeneName	SLC30A1 ZNT1
Length	507
Function	Zinc ion:proton antiporter that could function at the plasma membrane mediating zinc efflux from cells against its electrochemical gradient protecting them from intracellular zinc accumulation and toxicity (PubMed:31471319). Alternatively, could prevent the transport to the plasma membrane of CACNB2, the L-type calcium channels regulatory subunit, through a yet to be defined mechanism. By modulating the expression of these channels at the plasma membrane, could prevent calcium and zinc influx into cells. By the same mechanism, could also prevent L-type calcium channels-mediated heavy metal influx into cells (By similarity). In some cells, could also function as a zinc ion:proton antiporter mediating zinc entry into the lumen of cytoplasmic vesicles. In macrophages, can increase zinc ions concentration into the lumen of cytoplasmic vesicles containing engulfed bacteria and could help inactivate them (PubMed:32441444). Forms a complex with TMC6/EVER1 and TMC8/EVER2 at the ER membrane of keratynocytes which facilitates zinc uptake into the ER (PubMed:18158319). Down-regulates the activity of transcription factors induced by zinc and cytokines (PubMed:18158319).
