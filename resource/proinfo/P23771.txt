Accession	P23771;Q5VWG7;Q5VWG8;Q96J16
EntryName	GATA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trans-acting T-cell-specific transcription factor GATA-3 (GATA-binding factor 3)
GeneName	GATA3
Length	443
Function	Transcriptional activator which binds to the enhancer of the T-cell receptor alpha and delta genes. Binds to the consensus sequence 5'-AGATAG-3'. Required for the T-helper 2 (Th2) differentiation process following immune and inflammatory responses. Positively regulates ASB2 expression (By similarity). Coordinates macrophage transcriptional activation and UCP2-dependent metabolic reprogramming in response to IL33. Upon tissue injury, acts downstream of IL33 signaling to drive differentiation of inflammation-resolving alternatively activated macrophages.
