UniprotID	Q96EU7
Accession	Q96EU7;A8K246;Q8WWS3;Q9NZX1
EntryName	C1GLC_HUMAN
ProteinName	C1GALT1-specific chaperone 1 (C38H2-like protein 1) (C38H2-L1) (Core 1 beta1,3-galactosyltransferase 2) (C1Gal-T2) (C1GalT2) (Core 1 beta3-Gal-T2) (Core 1 beta3-galactosyltransferase-specific molecular chaperone)
GeneName	C1GALT1C1 COSMC HSPC067 MSTP143 UNQ273/PRO310
Length	318
Function	Probable chaperone required for the generation of 1 O-glycan Gal-beta1-3GalNAc-alpha1-Ser/Thr (T antigen), which is a precursor for many extended O-glycans in glycoproteins. Probably acts as a specific molecular chaperone assisting the folding/stability of core 1 beta-3-galactosyltransferase (C1GALT1).
