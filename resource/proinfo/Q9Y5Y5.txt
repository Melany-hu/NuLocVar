UniprotID	Q9Y5Y5
Accession	Q9Y5Y5;Q9BWB9
EntryName	PEX16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisomal membrane protein PEX16 (Peroxin-16) (Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 16)
GeneName	PEX16
Length	336
Function	Required for peroxisome membrane biogenesis. May play a role in early stages of peroxisome assembly. Can recruit other peroxisomal proteins, such as PEX3 and PMP34, to de novo peroxisomes derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). May function as receptor for PEX3.
Subcellular Location	Peroxisome membrane
