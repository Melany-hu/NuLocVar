UniprotID	Q96FN9
Accession	Q96FN9;D3DS87
EntryName	DTD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase 2 (EC 3.1.1.96) (Animalia-specific tRNA deacylase) (ATD) (D-tyrosyl-tRNA(Tyr) deacylase 2) (L-alanyl-tRNA deacylase)
GeneName	DTD2 C14orf126
Length	168
Function	Deacylates mischarged D-aminoacyl-tRNAs (By similarity). Also deacylates mischarged glycyl-tRNA(Ala), protecting cells against glycine mischarging by AlaRS (By similarity). Probably acts by rejecting L-amino acids from its binding site rather than specific recognition of D-amino acids (By similarity). Catalyzes the hydrolysis of D-tyrosyl-tRNA(Tyr), has no activity on correctly charged L-tyrosyl-tRNA(Tyr) (By similarity). By recycling D-aminoacyl-tRNA to D-amino acids and free tRNA molecules, this enzyme counteracts the toxicity associated with the formation of D-aminoacyl-tRNA entities in vivo and helps enforce protein L-homochirality. In contrast to DTD1, deacylates L-Ala mischarged on tRNA(Thr)(G4.U69) by alanine-tRNA ligase AARS (PubMed:29410408). Can deacylate L-Ala due to a relaxed specificity for substrate chirality caused by the trans conformation of the Gly-Pro motif in the active site (PubMed:29410408). Also hydrolyzes correctly charged, achiral, glycyl-tRNA(Gly) in vitro, although in vivo EEF1A1/EF-Tu may protect cognate achiral glycyl-tRNA(Gly) from DTD2-mediated deacetylation (By similarity).
