UniprotID	Q5VYX0
Accession	Q5VYX0;Q9BS33;Q9NUP8
EntryName	RNLS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Renalase (EC 1.6.3.5) (Monoamine oxidase-C) (MAO-C)
GeneName	RNLS C10orf59
Length	342
Function	Catalyzes the oxidation of the less abundant 1,2-dihydro-beta-NAD(P) and 1,6-dihydro-beta-NAD(P) to form beta-NAD(P)(+). The enzyme hormone is secreted by the kidney, and circulates in blood and modulates cardiac function and systemic blood pressure. Lowers blood pressure in vivo by decreasing cardiac contractility and heart rate and preventing a compensatory increase in peripheral vascular tone, suggesting a causal link to the increased plasma catecholamine and heightened cardiovascular risk. High concentrations of catecholamines activate plasma renalase and promotes its secretion and synthesis.
