UniprotID	Q15041-2
Accession	Q15041;B7Z6S5;B7Z791;F5GXP4
EntryName	AR6P1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 6-interacting protein 1 (ARL-6-interacting protein 1) (Aip-1) (Apoptotic regulator in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum)
GeneName	ARL6IP1 ARL6IP ARMER KIAA0069
Length	174
Function	Positively regulates SLC1A1/EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport by increasing its affinity for glutamate in a PKC activity-dependent manner. Promotes the catalytic efficiency of SLC1A1/EAAC1 probably by reducing its interaction with ARL6IP5, a negative regulator of SLC1A1/EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport (By similarity). Plays a role in the formation and stabilization of endoplasmic reticulum tubules (PubMed:24262037). Negatively regulates apoptosis, possibly by modulating the activity of caspase-9 (CASP9). Inhibits cleavage of CASP9-dependent substrates and downstream markers of apoptosis but not CASP9 itself (PubMed:12754298). May be involved in protein transport, membrane trafficking, or cell signaling during hematopoietic maturation (PubMed:10995579).
