UniprotID	Q96DA6
Accession	Q96DA6;B2R4B1;C9JBV1
EntryName	TIM14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit TIM14 (DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 19)
GeneName	DNAJC19 TIM14 TIMM14
Length	116
Function	Mitochondrial co-chaperone which forms a complex with prohibitins to regulate cardiolipin remodeling (By similarity). May be a component of the PAM complex, a complex required for the translocation of transit peptide-containing proteins from the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix in an ATP-dependent manner. May act as a co-chaperone that stimulate the ATP-dependent activity (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
