UniprotID	P53582
Accession	P53582;B4E2E6
EntryName	MAP11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methionine aminopeptidase 1 (MAP 1) (MetAP 1) (EC 3.4.11.18) (Peptidase M 1)
GeneName	METAP1 KIAA0094
Length	386
Function	Cotranslationally removes the N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins. The N-terminal methionine is often cleaved when the second residue in the primary sequence is small and uncharged (Met-Ala-, Cys, Gly, Pro, Ser, Thr, or Val). Required for normal progression through the cell cycle.
