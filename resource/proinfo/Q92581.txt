EntryName	SL9A6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium/hydrogen exchanger 6 (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 6) (NHE-6) (Solute carrier family 9 member 6)
GeneName	SLC9A6 KIAA0267 NHE6
Length	701
Function	Endosomal Na(+), K(+)/H(+) antiporter (PubMed:15522866, PubMed:28635961, PubMed:31676550, PubMed:32277048). Mediates the electroneutral exchange of endosomal luminal H(+) for a cytosolic Na(+) or K(+). By facilitating proton efflux, SLC9A6 counteracts the acidity generated by vacuolar (V)-ATPase, thereby limiting luminal acidification. Responsible for alkalizing and maintaining the endosomal pH, and consequently in, e.g., endosome maturation and trafficking of recycling endosomal cargo (PubMed:15522866, PubMed:28635961, PubMed:31676550, PubMed:32277048). Plays a critical role during neurodevelopment by regulating synaptic development and plasticity (By similarity). Implicated in the maintenance of cell polarity in a manner that is dependent on its ability to modulate intravesicular pH (PubMed:20130086). Regulates intracelular pH in some specialized cells, osteoclasts and stereocilia where this transporter localizes to the plasma membrane (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endosome membrane; Recycling endosome membrane; Early endosome membrane; Late endosome membrane; Cell membrane
