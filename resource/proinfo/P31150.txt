UniprotID	P31150
Accession	P31150;P50394;Q6FG50;Q7Z2G6;Q7Z2G9;Q7Z2H5;Q7Z2I6
EntryName	GDIA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha (Rab GDI alpha) (Guanosine diphosphate dissociation inhibitor 1) (GDI-1) (Oligophrenin-2) (Protein XAP-4)
GeneName	GDI1 GDIL OPHN2 RABGDIA XAP4
Length	447
Function	Regulates the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of most Rab proteins by inhibiting the dissociation of GDP from them, and the subsequent binding of GTP to them. Promotes the dissociation of GDP-bound Rab proteins from the membrane and inhibits their activation. Promotes the dissociation of RAB1A, RAB3A, RAB5A and RAB10 from membranes.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network
