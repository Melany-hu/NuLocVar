UniprotID	O60516
Accession	O60516
EntryName	4EBP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 3 (4E-BP3) (eIF4E-binding protein 3)
GeneName	EIF4EBP3
Length	100
Function	Repressor of translation initiation that regulates EIF4E activity by preventing its assembly into the eIF4F complex: the hypophosphorylated form competes with EIF4G1/EIF4G3 and strongly binds to EIF4E, leading to repression of translation. In contrast, the hyperphosphorylated form dissociates from EIF4E, allowing interaction between EIF4G1/EIF4G3 and EIF4E, leading to initiation of translation (By similarity). Inhibits EIF4E-mediated mRNA nuclear export (PubMed:22684010).
