UniprotID	Q96BK5
Accession	Q96BK5;B2R9B1;Q548A5;Q6QWG9;Q7Z7J8;Q96QD7;Q9HBU7;Q9NWW2
EntryName	PINX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	PIN2/TERF1-interacting telomerase inhibitor 1 (Liver-related putative tumor suppressor) (Pin2-interacting protein X1) (Protein 67-11-3) (TRF1-interacting protein 1)
GeneName	PINX1 LPTL LPTS
Length	328
Function	Microtubule-binding protein essential for faithful chromosome segregation. Mediates TRF1 and TERT accumulation in nucleolus and enhances TRF1 binding to telomeres. Inhibits telomerase activity. May inhibit cell proliferation and act as tumor suppressor.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleus; Nucleolus; Chromosome; Telomere; Chromosome; Centromere; Kinetochore
