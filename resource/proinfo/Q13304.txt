UniprotID	Q13304
Accession	Q13304;A8K9L0;B2R9X0;Q8N5S7;Q9UDZ6;Q9UE21
EntryName	GPR17_HUMAN
ProteinName	Uracil nucleotide/cysteinyl leukotriene receptor (UDP/CysLT receptor) (G-protein coupled receptor 17) (P2Y-like receptor) (R12)
GeneName	GPR17
Length	367
Function	Dual specificity receptor for uracil nucleotides and cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs). Signals through G(i) and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. May mediate brain damage by nucleotides and CysLTs following ischemia.
