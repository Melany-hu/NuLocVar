UniprotID	P17081
Accession	P17081;D6W5A6;Q0VGN1;Q52LS8;Q53SJ1;Q6NS39;Q6P146;Q7Z480
EntryName	RHOQ_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoQ (Ras-like protein TC10) (Ras-like protein family member 7A)
GeneName	RHOQ ARHQ RASL7A TC10
Length	205
Function	Plasma membrane-associated small GTPase which cycles between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound state. In active state binds to a variety of effector proteins to regulate cellular responses. Involved in epithelial cell polarization processes. May play a role in CFTR trafficking to the plasma membrane. Causes the formation of thin, actin-rich surface projections called filopodia.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cell membrane
