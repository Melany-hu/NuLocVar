EntryName	PHYD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase domain-containing protein 1 (Protein PHYHD1) (EC 1.14.11.-)
GeneName	PHYHD1
Length	291
Function	2-oxoglutarate(2OG)-dependent dioxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinate and CO(2) in an iron-dependent manner (PubMed:21530488). However, does not couple 2OG turnover to the hydroxylation of acyl-coenzyme A derivatives, implying that it is not directly involved in phytanoyl coenzyme-A metabolism (PubMed:21530488). Does not show detectable activity towards fatty acid CoA thioesters (PubMed:21530488).
