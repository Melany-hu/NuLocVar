UniprotID	Q92597
Accession	Q92597;B3KR80;B7Z446;O15207;Q6IBG2;Q9NYR6;Q9UK29
EntryName	NDRG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein NDRG1 (Differentiation-related gene 1 protein) (DRG-1) (N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 protein) (Nickel-specific induction protein Cap43) (Reducing agents and tunicamycin-responsive protein) (RTP) (Rit42)
GeneName	NDRG1 CAP43 DRG1 RTP
Length	394
Function	Stress-responsive protein involved in hormone responses, cell growth, and differentiation. Acts as a tumor suppressor in many cell types. Necessary but not sufficient for p53/TP53-mediated caspase activation and apoptosis. Has a role in cell trafficking, notably of the Schwann cell, and is necessary for the maintenance and development of the peripheral nerve myelin sheath. Required for vesicular recycling of CDH1 and TF. May also function in lipid trafficking. Protects cells from spindle disruption damage. Functions in p53/TP53-dependent mitotic spindle checkpoint. Regulates microtubule dynamics and maintains euploidy.
