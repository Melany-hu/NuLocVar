UniprotID	O95685
Accession	O95685;Q6DK02
EntryName	PPR3D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3D (Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 6) (PP1 subunit R6) (Protein phosphatase 1-binding subunit R6)
GeneName	PPP1R3D PPP1R6
Length	299
Function	Seems to act as a glycogen-targeting subunit for PP1. PP1 is essential for cell division, and participates in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, muscle contractility and protein synthesis.
