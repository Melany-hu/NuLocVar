EntryName	NAPEP_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D) (NAPE-PLD) (NAPE-hydrolyzing phospholipase D) (EC 3.1.4.54)
GeneName	NAPEPLD C7orf18
Length	393
Function	D-type phospholipase that hydrolyzes N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) to produce bioactive N-acylethanolamines/fatty acid ethanolamides (NAEs/FAEs) and phosphatidic acid (PubMed:14634025, PubMed:16527816, PubMed:25684574, PubMed:27571266). Cleaves the terminal phosphodiester bond of diacyl- and alkenylacyl-NAPEs, primarily playing a role in the generation of long-chain saturated and monounsaturated NAEs in the brain (By similarity). May control NAPE homeostasis in dopaminergic neuron membranes and regulate neuron survival, partly through RAC1 activation (By similarity). As a regulator of lipid metabolism in the adipose tissue, mediates the crosstalk between adipocytes, gut microbiota and immune cells to control body temperature and weight. In particular, regulates energy homeostasis by promoting cold-induced brown or beige adipocyte differentiation program to generate heat from fatty acids and glucose. Has limited D-type phospholipase activity toward N-acyl lyso-NAPEs (By similarity).
