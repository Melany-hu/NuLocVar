EntryName	HS2ST_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase 1 (2-O-sulfotransferase) (2OST) (EC 2.8.2.-)
GeneName	HS2ST1 HS2ST KIAA0448
Length	356
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of sulfate to the C2-position of selected hexuronic acid residues within the maturing heparan sulfate (HS). Mediates 2-O-sulfation of both L-iduronyl and D-glucuronyl residues. 2-O-sulfation within HS, particularly of iduronate residues, is essential for HS to participate in a variety of high-affinity ligand-binding interactions and signaling processes. Required for metanephric development of kidney formation, suggesting that 2-O-sulfation within HS is essential for signaling between ureteric bud and metanephric mesenchyme.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
