EntryName	RGMA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Repulsive guidance molecule A (RGM domain family member A)
GeneName	RGMA RGM
Length	450
Function	Member of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family that performs several functions in the developing and adult nervous system. Regulates cephalic neural tube closure, inhibits neurite outgrowth and cortical neuron branching, and the formation of mature synapses. Binding to its receptor NEO1/neogenin induces activation of RHOA-ROCK1/Rho-kinase signaling pathway through UNC5B-ARHGEF12/LARG-PTK2/FAK1 cascade, leading to collapse of the neuronal growth cone and neurite outgrowth inhibition. Furthermore, RGMA binding to NEO1/neogenin leads to HRAS inactivation by influencing HRAS-PTK2/FAK1-AKT1 pathway. It also functions as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor that may signal through SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8.
