UniprotID	O95997
Accession	O95997
EntryName	PTTG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Securin (Esp1-associated protein) (Pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 protein) (Tumor-transforming protein 1) (hPTTG)
GeneName	PTTG1 EAP1 PTTG TUTR1
Length	202
Function	Regulatory protein, which plays a central role in chromosome stability, in the p53/TP53 pathway, and DNA repair. Probably acts by blocking the action of key proteins. During the mitosis, it blocks Separase/ESPL1 function, preventing the proteolysis of the cohesin complex and the subsequent segregation of the chromosomes. At the onset of anaphase, it is ubiquitinated, conducting to its destruction and to the liberation of ESPL1. Its function is however not limited to a blocking activity, since it is required to activate ESPL1. Negatively regulates the transcriptional activity and related apoptosis activity of TP53. The negative regulation of TP53 may explain the strong transforming capability of the protein when it is overexpressed. May also play a role in DNA repair via its interaction with Ku, possibly by connecting DNA damage-response pathways with sister chromatid separation.
