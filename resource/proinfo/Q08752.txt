UniprotID	Q08752
Accession	Q08752;B2R9V2
EntryName	PPID_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase D (PPIase D) (EC 5.2.1.8) (40 kDa peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase) (Cyclophilin-40) (CYP-40) (Cyclophilin-related protein) (Rotamase D)
GeneName	PPID CYP40 CYPD
Length	370
Function	PPIase that catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and may therefore assist protein folding (PubMed:11350175, PubMed:20676357). Proposed to act as a co-chaperone in HSP90 complexes such as in unligated steroid receptors heterocomplexes. Different co-chaperones seem to compete for association with HSP90 thus establishing distinct HSP90-co-chaperone-receptor complexes with the potential to exert tissue-specific receptor activity control. May have a preference for estrogen receptor complexes and is not found in glucocorticoid receptor complexes. May be involved in cytoplasmic dynein-dependent movement of the receptor from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. May regulate MYB by inhibiting its DNA-binding activity. Involved in regulation of AHR signaling by promoting the formation of the AHR:ARNT dimer; the function is independent of HSP90 but requires the chaperone activity. Involved in regulation of UV radiation-induced apoptosis. Promotes cell viability in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALK+ ALCL) cell lines.
