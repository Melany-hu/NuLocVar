UniprotID	P57088
Accession	P57088;B3KSS8;Q9H953
EntryName	TMM33_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 33 (Protein DB83) (SHINC-3)
GeneName	TMEM33 DB83
Length	247
Function	Acts as a regulator of the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network by modulating intracellular calcium homeostasis. Mechanistically, stimulates PKD2 calcium-dependent activity (By similarity). Suppresses the RTN3/4-induced formation of the ER tubules (PubMed:25612671). Positively regulates PERK-mediated and IRE1-mediated unfolded protein response signaling (PubMed:26268696). Plays an essential role in VEGF-mediated release of Ca(2+) from ER stores during angiogenesis (PubMed:30760708). Also plays a role in the modulation of innate immune signaling through the cGAS-STING pathway by interacting with RNF26 (PubMed:32614325). Participates in lipid metabolism by acting as a downstream effector of the pyruvate kinase/PKM. Forms a complex with RNF5 to facilitate polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of SCAP on the ER membrane (PubMed:34487377).
