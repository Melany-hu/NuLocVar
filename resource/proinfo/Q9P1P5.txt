UniprotID	Q9P1P5
Accession	Q9P1P5;Q5QD02;Q6NWS1;Q6NWS2;Q6NWS3
EntryName	TAAR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trace amine-associated receptor 2 (TaR-2) (Trace amine receptor 2) (G-protein coupled receptor 58)
GeneName	TAAR2 GPR58
Length	351
Function	Orphan olfactory receptor specific for trace amines. Trace amine compounds are enriched in animal body fluids and act on trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) to elicit both intraspecific and interspecific innate behaviors. Ligand-binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via the G(s)-class of G-proteins which activate adenylate cyclase.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
