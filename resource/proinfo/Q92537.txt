UniprotID	Q92537
Accession	Q92537
EntryName	SUSD6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sushi domain-containing protein 6 (Drug-activated gene overexpressed protein)
GeneName	SUSD6 DRAGO KIAA0247
Length	303
Function	May play a role in growth-suppressive activity and cell death (PubMed:24652652). May be involved in the production of chemokine molecules in umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured in THP1 monocyte LPS-induced medium (PubMed:20236627). Plays a role in preventing tumor onset (By similarity).
