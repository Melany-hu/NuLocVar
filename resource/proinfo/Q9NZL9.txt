EntryName	MAT2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methionine adenosyltransferase 2 subunit beta (Methionine adenosyltransferase II beta) (MAT II beta) (Putative dTDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose 4-reductase)
GeneName	MAT2B TGR MSTP045 Nbla02999 UNQ2435/PRO4995
Length	334
Function	Regulatory subunit of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 2, an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of S-adenosylmethionine from methionine and ATP. Regulates MAT2A catalytic activity by changing its kinetic properties, increasing its affinity for L-methionine (PubMed:10644686, PubMed:23189196, PubMed:25075345). Can bind NADP (in vitro) (PubMed:23189196, PubMed:23425511).
