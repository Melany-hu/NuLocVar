UniprotID	Q9BUB5
Accession	Q9BUB5;D3DQ20;D3DQ21;O00312;Q5TC06;Q5TC07;Q6V0N6
EntryName	MKNK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (EC 2.7.11.1) (MAP kinase signal-integrating kinase 1) (MAPK signal-integrating kinase 1) (Mnk1)
GeneName	MKNK1 MNK1
Length	465
Function	May play a role in the response to environmental stress and cytokines. Appears to regulate translation by phosphorylating EIF4E, thus increasing the affinity of this protein for the 7-methylguanosine-containing mRNA cap.
