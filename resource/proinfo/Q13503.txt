UniprotID	Q13503
Accession	Q13503;B2R4I3;Q6IB05;Q92811
EntryName	MED21_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 21 (Mediator complex subunit 21) (RNA polymerase II holoenzyme component SRB7) (RNAPII complex component SRB7) (hSrb7)
GeneName	MED21 SRB7 SURB7
Length	144
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
