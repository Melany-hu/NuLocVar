UniprotID	P23582
Accession	P23582;Q4ZG41
EntryName	ANFC_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-type natriuretic peptide [Cleaved into: CNP-22; CNP-29; CNP-53]
GeneName	NPPC CNP2
Length	126
Function	Hormone which plays a role in endochondral ossification through regulation of cartilaginous growth plate chondrocytes proliferation and differentiation (By similarity). May also be vasoactive and natriuretic (PubMed:1672777). Acts by specifically binding and stimulating NPR2 to produce cGMP (PubMed:1672777, PubMed:21098034). Binds the clearance receptor NPR3 (PubMed:11533490).
