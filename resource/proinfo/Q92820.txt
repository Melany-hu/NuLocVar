UniprotID	Q92820
Accession	Q92820
EntryName	GGH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (EC 3.4.19.9) (Conjugase) (GH) (Gamma-Glu-X carboxypeptidase)
GeneName	GGH
Length	318
Function	Hydrolyzes the polyglutamate sidechains of pteroylpolyglutamates. Progressively removes gamma-glutamyl residues from pteroylpoly-gamma-glutamate to yield pteroyl-alpha-glutamate (folic acid) and free glutamate (PubMed:11005824, PubMed:8816764). May play an important role in the bioavailability of dietary pteroylpolyglutamates and in the metabolism of pteroylpolyglutamates and antifolates.
