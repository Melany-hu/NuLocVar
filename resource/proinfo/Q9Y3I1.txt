Function	Substrate recognition component of a SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins and plays a role in several biological processes such as cell cycle, cell proliferation, or maintenance of chromosome stability (PubMed:15145941, PubMed:34791250). Recognizes and ubiquitinates BIRC2 and the cell cycle regulator DLGAP5 (PubMed:15145941, PubMed:16510124, PubMed:22212761). Plays a role downstream of PINK1 in the clearance of damaged mitochondria via selective autophagy (mitophagy) by targeting PRKN to dysfunctional depolarized mitochondria. Promotes MFN1 ubiquitination. Mediates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of UXT isoform 2, thereby impairing the NF-kappa-B signaling pathway (PubMed:33010352). Inhibits NF-kappa-B pathway also by promoting the ubiquitination of TRAF2 (PubMed:22212761). Affects the assembly state and activity of the proteasome in the cells including neurons by ubiquitinating the proteasomal subunit PSMA2 via 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains (By similarity). Promotes 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination SIRT7, leading to the hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death (PubMed:36646384).
