Accession	Q96EY1;B2RAJ5;B4DI33;E7ES32;O75472;Q8WUJ6;Q8WXJ3;Q96D76;Q96IV1;Q9NYH8
EntryName	DNJA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	DnaJ homolog subfamily A member 3, mitochondrial (DnaJ protein Tid-1) (hTid-1) (Hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 57) (Tumorous imaginal discs protein Tid56 homolog)
GeneName	DNAJA3 HCA57 TID1
Length	480
Function	Modulates apoptotic signal transduction or effector structures within the mitochondrial matrix. Affect cytochrome C release from the mitochondria and caspase 3 activation, but not caspase 8 activation. Isoform 1 increases apoptosis triggered by both TNF and the DNA-damaging agent mytomycin C; in sharp contrast, isoform 2 suppresses apoptosis. Can modulate IFN-gamma-mediated transcriptional activity. Isoform 2 may play a role in neuromuscular junction development as an effector of the MUSK signaling pathway.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix; Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Postsynaptic cell membrane
