UniprotID	Q9UIJ7
Accession	Q9UIJ7;B4DP58;D3DRI1;E7ET30;Q5VYW6;Q9H576;Q9HC01;Q9NPB4
EntryName	KAD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	GTP:AMP phosphotransferase AK3, mitochondrial (EC 2.7.4.10) (Adenylate kinase 3) (Adenylate kinase 3 alpha-like 1) (Adenylate kinase isozyme 3)
GeneName	AK3 AK3L1 AK6 AKL3L
Length	227
Function	Mitochondrial adenylate kinase with a specific GTP:AMP phosphotransferase activity (PubMed:11485571, PubMed:32822537). Could also use ITP as phosphate donor (PubMed:11485571). Its physiological function is to recycle GTP into GDP which is necessary for the TCA cycle in the mitochondrial matrix (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
