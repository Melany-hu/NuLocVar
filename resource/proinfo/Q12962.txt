UniprotID	Q12962
Accession	Q12962;O00703;Q13175;Q6FH13
EntryName	TAF10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 10 (STAF28) (Transcription initiation factor TFIID 30 kDa subunit) (TAF(II)30) (TAFII-30) (TAFII30)
GeneName	TAF10 TAF2A TAF2H TAFII30
Length	218
Function	The TFIID basal transcription factor complex plays a major role in the initiation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription (PubMed:33795473). TFIID recognizes and binds promoters with or without a TATA box via its subunit TBP, a TATA-box-binding protein, and promotes assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (PubMed:33795473). The TFIID complex consists of TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), including TAF1, TAF2, TAF3, TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF7, TAF8, TAF9, TAF10, TAF11, TAF12 and TAF13 (PubMed:33795473). TAF10 is also component of the PCAF histone acetylase complex, the TATA-binding protein-free TAF complex (TFTC) and the STAGA transcription coactivator-HAT complex (PubMed:10373431, PubMed:11564863, PubMed:12601814, PubMed:18206972, PubMed:9885574). May regulate cyclin E expression (By similarity).
