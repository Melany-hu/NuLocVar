EntryName	IOD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Type I iodothyronine deiodinase (EC 1.21.99.3) (EC 1.21.99.4) (5DI) (DIOI) (Type 1 DI) (Type-I 5'-deiodinase)
GeneName	DIO1 ITDI1 TXDI1
Length	249
Function	Plays a crucial role in the metabolism of thyroid hormones (TH) and has specific roles in TH activation and inactivation by deiodination. Catalyzes the conversion of T4 (L-thyroxine/3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine) to T3 (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine) via outer-ring deiodination (ORD) and the conversion of T4 to rT3 (3,3',5'-triiodothyronine) via inner-ring deiodination (IRD) (PubMed:32718224). Catalyzes the conversion of rT3 to T2 (3,3'-diiodothyronine) via ORD (PubMed:12586771). Catalyzes the conversion 3',5'-T2 (3,5-diiodothyronine) to 3-T1 (3-monoiodothyronine) via ORD (PubMed:18821722). Catalyzes the conversion of T3 to T2 via IRD (By similarity).
