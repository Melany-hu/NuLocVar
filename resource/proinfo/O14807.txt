UniprotID	O14807
Accession	O14807;B4DIK0;Q86WX8
EntryName	RASM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein M-Ras (EC 3.6.5.2) (Ras-related protein R-Ras3)
GeneName	MRAS RRAS3
Length	208
Function	Signal transducer in the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway that regulates cell proliferation and survival (PubMed:16630891, PubMed:28289718, PubMed:35768504, PubMed:35830882, PubMed:35831509, PubMed:36175670). Core component of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1c (SMP) holophosphatase complex that regulates the MAPK pathway activation (PubMed:16630891, PubMed:35768504, PubMed:35830882, PubMed:35831509, PubMed:36175670). The formation of the SMP complex only occurs when MRAS is GTP-bound (PubMed:35768504, PubMed:35830882, PubMed:35831509, PubMed:36175670). The SMP complex specifically dephosphorylates the inhibitory phosphorylation at 'Ser-259' of RAF1 kinase, 'Ser-365' of BRAF kinase and 'Ser-214' of ARAF kinase, stimulating their kinase activities (PubMed:16630891, PubMed:35768504, PubMed:35830882, PubMed:35831509, PubMed:36175670).
