UniprotID	Q15005
Accession	Q15005;Q15507;Q3KQT0;Q641R4;Q6FG65;Q6IRX0;Q6P1P4;Q96HU9
EntryName	SPCS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal peptidase complex subunit 2 (Microsomal signal peptidase 25 kDa subunit) (SPase 25 kDa subunit)
GeneName	SPCS2 KIAA0102 SPC25
Length	226
Function	Component of the signal peptidase complex (SPC) which catalyzes the cleavage of N-terminal signal sequences from nascent proteins as they are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:34388369). Enhances the enzymatic activity of SPC and facilitates the interactions between different components of the translocation site (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
