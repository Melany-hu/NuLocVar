EntryName	RBM14_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA-binding protein 14 (Paraspeckle protein 2) (PSP2) (RNA-binding motif protein 14) (RRM-containing coactivator activator/modulator) (Synaptotagmin-interacting protein) (SYT-interacting protein)
GeneName	RBM14 SIP
Length	156
Function	Isoform 1 may function as a nuclear receptor coactivator, enhancing transcription through other coactivators such as NCOA6 and CITED1. Isoform 2, functions as a transcriptional repressor, modulating transcriptional activities of coactivators including isoform 1, NCOA6 and CITED1 (PubMed:11443112). Regulates centriole biogenesis by suppressing the formation of aberrant centriolar protein complexes in the cytoplasm and thus preserving mitotic spindle integrity. Prevents the formation of the STIL-CPAP complex (which can induce the formation of aberrant centriolar protein complexes) by interfering with the interaction of STIL with CPAP (PubMed:25385835). Plays a role in the regulation of DNA virus-mediated innate immune response by assembling into the HDP-RNP complex, a complex that serves as a platform for IRF3 phosphorylation and subsequent innate immune response activation through the cGAS-STING pathway (PubMed:28712728). Also involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing (PubMed:37548402).
