UniprotID	O15432
Accession	O15432
EntryName	COPT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein SLC31A2 (Copper transporter 2) (hCTR2) (Solute carrier family 31 member 2)
GeneName	SLC31A2 COPT2 CTR2
Length	143
Function	Does not function as a copper(1+) importer in vivo (By similarity). However, in vitro functions as a low-affinity copper(1+) importer (PubMed:17617060, PubMed:17944601). Regulator of SLC31A1 which facilitates the cleavage of the SLC31A1 ecto-domain or which stabilizes the truncated form of SLC31A1 (Truncated CTR1 form), thereby drives the SLC31A1 truncated form-dependent endosomal copper export and modulates the copper and cisplatin accumulation via SLC31A1 (By similarity).
