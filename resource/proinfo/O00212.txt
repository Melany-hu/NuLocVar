UniprotID	O00212
Accession	O00212
EntryName	RHOD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoD (Rho-related protein HP1) (RhoHP1)
GeneName	RHOD ARHD
Length	210
Function	Involved in endosome dynamics. May coordinate membrane transport with the function of the cytoskeleton. Involved in the internalization and trafficking of activated tyrosine kinase receptors such as PDGFRB. Participates in the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton; the function seems to involve WHAMM and includes regulation of filopodia formation and actin filament bundling. Can modulate the effect of DAPK3 in reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion dissolution.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Early endosome
