EntryName	SBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methanethiol oxidase (MTO) (EC 1.8.3.4) (56 kDa selenium-binding protein) (SBP56) (SP56) (Selenium-binding protein 1)
GeneName	SELENBP1 SBP
Length	472
Function	Catalyzes the oxidation of methanethiol, an organosulfur compound known to be produced in substantial amounts by gut bacteria (PubMed:29255262). Selenium-binding protein which may be involved in the sensing of reactive xenobiotics in the cytoplasm. May be involved in intra-Golgi protein transport (By similarity).
