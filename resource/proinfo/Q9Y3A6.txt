UniprotID	Q9Y3A6
Accession	Q9Y3A6;B1AKT4;B2R703;D3DT38;Q96AX8
EntryName	TMED5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 5 (p24 family protein gamma-2) (p24gamma2) (p28)
GeneName	TMED5 CGI-100 UNQ397/PRO733
Length	229
Function	Potential role in vesicular protein trafficking, mainly in the early secretory pathway. Required for the maintenance of the Golgi apparatus; involved in protein exchange between Golgi stacks during assembly. Probably not required for COPI-vesicle-mediated retrograde transport.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus; cis-Golgi network membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane
