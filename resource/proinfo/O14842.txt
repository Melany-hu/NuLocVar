UniprotID	O14842
Accession	O14842;Q0VAS2;Q4VBL4
EntryName	FFAR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Free fatty acid receptor 1 (G-protein coupled receptor 40)
GeneName	FFAR1 GPR40
Length	300
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for medium and long chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids that plays an important role in glucose homeostasis. Fatty acid binding increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and may also enhance the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). May also play a role in bone homeostasis; receptor signaling activates pathways that inhibit osteoclast differentiation (By similarity). Ligand binding leads to a conformation change that triggers signaling via G-proteins that activate phospholipase C, leading to an increase of the intracellular calcium concentration. Seems to act through a G(q) and G(i)-mediated pathway. Mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
