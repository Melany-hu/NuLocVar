UniprotID	Q15543
Accession	Q15543;B2R5E5;Q5TYV6
EntryName	TAF13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 13 (Transcription initiation factor TFIID 18 kDa subunit) (TAF(II)18) (TAFII-18) (TAFII18)
GeneName	TAF13 TAF2K TAFII18
Length	124
Function	The TFIID basal transcription factor complex plays a major role in the initiation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-dependent transcription (PubMed:33795473, PubMed:9695952). TFIID recognizes and binds promoters via its subunit TBP, a TATA-box-binding protein, and promotes assembly of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (PubMed:33795473). The TFIID complex consists of TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), including TAF1, TAF2, TAF3, TAF4, TAF5, TAF6, TAF7, TAF8, TAF9, TAF10, TAF11, TAF12 and TAF13 (PubMed:33795473). TAF13, together with TAF11 and TBP, play key roles during promoter binding by the TFIID and TFIIA transcription factor complexes (PubMed:33795473).
