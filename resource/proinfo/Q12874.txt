UniprotID	Q12874
Accession	Q12874;D3DPT5;Q15460;Q5VT87
EntryName	SF3A3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Splicing factor 3A subunit 3 (SF3a60) (Spliceosome-associated protein 61) (SAP 61)
GeneName	SF3A3 SAP61
Length	501
Function	Component of the 17S U2 SnRNP complex of the spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex that removes introns from transcribed pre-mRNAs (PubMed:10882114, PubMed:11533230, PubMed:32494006, PubMed:34822310, PubMed:8022796). The 17S U2 SnRNP complex (1) directly participates in early spliceosome assembly and (2) mediates recognition of the intron branch site during pre-mRNA splicing by promoting the selection of the pre-mRNA branch-site adenosine, the nucleophile for the first step of splicing (PubMed:10882114, PubMed:11533230, PubMed:32494006, PubMed:34822310). Within the 17S U2 SnRNP complex, SF3A3 is part of the SF3A subcomplex that contributes to the assembly of the 17S U2 snRNP, and the subsequent assembly of the pre-spliceosome 'E' complex and the pre-catalytic spliceosome 'A' complex (PubMed:10882114, PubMed:11533230). Involved in pre-mRNA splicing as a component of pre-catalytic spliceosome 'B' complexes (PubMed:29360106, PubMed:30315277).
