UniprotID	Q9H2X3
Accession	Q9H2X3;A6NKI4;A8K8B3;Q69F40;Q969M4;Q96QP3;Q96QP4;Q96QP5;Q96QP6;Q9BXS3;Q9H2Q9;Q9H8F0;Q9Y2A8
EntryName	CLC4M_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-type lectin domain family 4 member M (CD209 antigen-like protein 1) (DC-SIGN-related protein) (DC-SIGNR) (Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin 2) (DC-SIGN2) (Liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin) (L-SIGN) (CD antigen CD299)
GeneName	CLEC4M CD209L CD209L1 CD299
Length	399
Function	Probable pathogen-recognition receptor involved in peripheral immune surveillance in liver. May mediate the endocytosis of pathogens which are subsequently degraded in lysosomal compartments. Is a receptor for ICAM3, probably by binding to mannose-like carbohydrates.
