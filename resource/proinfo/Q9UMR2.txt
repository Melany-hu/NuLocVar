UniprotID	Q9UMR2
Accession	Q9UMR2;B3KNE9;B4DXS6;E7EMK4;Q6FIB7;Q6IAE0;Q96KE7;Q9H0U0
EntryName	DD19B_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX19B (EC 3.6.4.13) (DEAD box RNA helicase DEAD5) (DEAD box protein 19B)
GeneName	DDX19B DBP5 DDX19 TDBP
Length	479
Function	ATP-dependent RNA helicase involved in mRNA export from the nucleus (PubMed:10428971). Rather than unwinding RNA duplexes, DDX19B functions as a remodeler of ribonucleoprotein particles, whereby proteins bound to nuclear mRNA are dissociated and replaced by cytoplasmic mRNA binding proteins (PubMed:10428971).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Nucleoplasm
Disorder	0.3356,0.3983,0.4409,0.4864,0.4801,0.4725,0.4685,0.5017,0.5176,0.4619,0.4766,0.5055,0.4541,0.4652,0.3840,0.3807,0.4864,0.5211,0.5901,0.5139,0.5707,0.5992,0.6043,0.6043,0.6043,0.6375,0.6322,0.5807,0.4979,0.4940,0.5758,0.5992,0.5533,0.6576,0.6089,0.7163,0.7209,0.7080,0.7080,0.7331,0.8421,0.8655,0.8279,0.8279,0.8375,0.8198,0.7951,0.7916,0.8596,0.9039,0.8565,0.7799,0.7799,0.7982,0.7036,0.6183,0.5951,0.5992,0.6089,0.5055,0.4292,0.4330,0.4292,0.4369,0.4330,0.4256,0.3631,0.4051,0.3667,0.2951,0.3019,0.3631,0.4476,0.4652,0.4864,0.5577,0.7120,0.6183,0.5176,0.5017,0.5098,0.5707,0.5456,0.4256,0.4369,0.4409,0.3599,0.4220,0.3356,0.3872,0.4864,0.4864,0.4149,0.3286,0.3019,0.2884,0.2292,0.1349,0.1702,0.2193,0.2193,0.1881,0.2064,0.2094,0.3356,0.3182,0.2988,0.2849,0.2918,0.3740,0.3948,0.3356,0.2609,0.3566,0.3566,0.3249,0.2575,0.2918,0.3807,0.4369,0.4940,0.4979,0.6322,0.5211,0.4292,0.3704,0.3740,0.3774,0.4652,0.4582,0.4409,0.4330,0.4582,0.5296,0.4979,0.5456,0.5419,0.5017,0.4582,0.3667,0.3087,0.2436,0.1671,0.1554,0.2224,0.2364,0.2783,0.3019,0.2752,0.2849,0.2849,0.2002,0.2224,0.2258,0.1611,0.1007,0.0749,0.0543,0.1028,0.1731,0.2503,0.1914,0.2328,0.2328,0.2034,0.1323,0.1942,0.1852,0.1583,0.1823,0.1184,0.0690,0.1275,0.1092,0.0851,0.1323,0.1969,0.1671,0.1554,0.1791,0.1671,0.1028,0.1643,0.0948,0.1275,0.0888,0.1184,0.0749,0.0749,0.0749,0.0817,0.1229,0.1251,0.1251,0.1251,0.1528,0.1554,0.1554,0.1731,0.2609,0.2470,0.2364,0.2328,0.1702,0.1671,0.1942,0.2884,0.3460,0.4186,0.4186,0.3460,0.2541,0.2715,0.2575,0.1554,0.1501,0.1476,0.0888,0.0888,0.0780,0.0454,0.0443,0.0518,0.0870,0.1251,0.1251,0.1229,0.0799,0.0327,0.0218,0.0134,0.0205,0.0356,0.0263,0.0506,0.0592,0.0473,0.0275,0.0372,0.0389,0.0780,0.1298,0.1206,0.1028,0.1115,0.1162,0.1823,0.1184,0.1731,0.1914,0.2609,0.3494,0.3019,0.2034,0.2645,0.2541,0.3392,0.2918,0.3840,0.3807,0.2918,0.2064,0.1206,0.1206,0.0985,0.0948,0.0463,0.0518,0.0948,0.0929,0.1007,0.0555,0.0543,0.0341,0.0483,0.0414,0.0405,0.0244,0.0263,0.0306,0.0405,0.0851,0.1476,0.1791,0.1162,0.1349,0.0799,0.1476,0.1373,0.1399,0.1501,0.2224,0.3215,0.2364,0.3566,0.3910,0.2988,0.2988,0.3704,0.3460,0.2224,0.1528,0.0765,0.0414,0.0646,0.1070,0.1070,0.1823,0.1942,0.1914,0.1007,0.0948,0.0749,0.0424,0.0424,0.0433,0.0248,0.0244,0.0253,0.0214,0.0223,0.0405,0.0372,0.0555,0.0967,0.0817,0.0690,0.0405,0.0202,0.0125,0.0133,0.0240,0.0235,0.0275,0.0483,0.0704,0.0646,0.0631,0.0676,0.0568,0.0581,0.1048,0.0605,0.1028,0.1206,0.1251,0.1449,0.1731,0.2575,0.2988,0.3529,0.2680,0.1852,0.1823,0.1852,0.1881,0.1852,0.1611,0.1823,0.2715,0.3053,0.3286,0.2918,0.3460,0.2884,0.2094,0.2094,0.2094,0.1229,0.1184,0.1791,0.2002,0.2783,0.3704,0.3704,0.3087,0.2224,0.1942,0.2292,0.2988,0.2988,0.2292,0.1583,0.1583,0.1791,0.2364,0.2328,0.2258,0.1731,0.2849,0.2918,0.2164,0.2193,0.1643,0.1115,0.0690,0.1070,0.0909,0.1349,0.0817,0.0967,0.0605,0.0929,0.1424,0.1702,0.1702,0.1823,0.2918,0.2918,0.3667,0.3667,0.3631,0.3426,0.2645,0.3356,0.3948,0.3948,0.3807,0.4864,0.4864,0.5854,0.5419,0.5017,0.4940,0.4940,0.4864,0.4864,0.3983,0.3426,0.2817,0.2817,0.2436,0.1823,0.2715,0.3529,0.3392,0.3494,0.4369,0.4119,0.4256,0.3426,0.2715,0.2849,0.3840,0.3053,0.3182,0.3321,0.3426,0.3249,0.3599,0.4149,0.3983,0.3426,0.4149,0.4087,0.3321,0.3392,0.3392,0.3392,0.3704,0.2817,0.3599,0.4441,0.3494,0.3599,0.4369,0.3529,0.3215,0.3215,0.4017,0.3704,0.3529,0.3321,0.4087,0.3704,0.3460,0.4369,0.4017,0.3529
