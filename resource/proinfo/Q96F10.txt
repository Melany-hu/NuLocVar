UniprotID	Q96F10
Accession	Q96F10
EntryName	SAT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thialysine N-epsilon-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.-) (Diamine acetyltransferase 2) (EC 2.3.1.57) (Spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase 2) (SSAT-2)
GeneName	SAT2 SSAT2
Length	170
Function	Catalyzes the N-acetylation of the amino acid thialysine (S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine), a L-lysine analog with the 4-methylene group substituted with a sulfur (PubMed:15283699). May also catalyze acetylation of polyamines, such as norspermidine, spermidine or spermine (PubMed:12803540). However, ability to acetylate polyamines is weak, suggesting that it does not act as a diamine acetyltransferase in vivo (PubMed:15283699).
