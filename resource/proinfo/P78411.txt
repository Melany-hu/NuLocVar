UniprotID	P78411
Accession	P78411;H0YMS7;P78416;Q7Z2E1
EntryName	IRX5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Iroquois-class homeodomain protein IRX-5 (Homeodomain protein IRX-2A) (Homeodomain protein IRXB2) (Iroquois homeobox protein 5)
GeneName	IRX5 IRX2A IRXB2
Length	483
Function	Establishes the cardiac repolarization gradient by its repressive actions on the KCND2 potassium-channel gene. Required for retinal cone bipolar cell differentiation. May regulate contrast adaptation in the retina and control specific aspects of visual function in circuits of the mammalian retina (By similarity). Could be involved in the regulation of both the cell cycle and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Involved in craniofacial and gonadal development. Modulates the migration of progenitor cell populations in branchial arches and gonads by repressing CXCL12.
