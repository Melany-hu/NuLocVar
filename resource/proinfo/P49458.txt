UniprotID	P49458
Accession	P49458;A8K0N0;Q6NVX0;Q8WTW0
EntryName	SRP09_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal recognition particle 9 kDa protein (SRP9)
GeneName	SRP9
Length	86
Function	Component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex, a ribonucleoprotein complex that mediates the cotranslational targeting of secretory and membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (By similarity). SRP9 together with SRP14 and the Alu portion of the SRP RNA, constitutes the elongation arrest domain of SRP (PubMed:11089964). The complex of SRP9 and SRP14 is required for SRP RNA binding (By similarity).
