UniprotID	P60323
Accession	P60323;Q495E5
EntryName	NANO3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nanos homolog 3 (NOS-3)
GeneName	NANOS3 NOS3
Length	173
Function	Plays a role in the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of germ cells regulating the spermatogonia cell cycle and inducing a prolonged transit in G1 phase. Affects cell proliferation probably by repressing translation of specific mRNAs. Maintains the germ cell lineage by suppressing both Bax-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways. Essential in the early stage embryo to protect the migrating primordial germ cells (PGCs) from apoptosis.
