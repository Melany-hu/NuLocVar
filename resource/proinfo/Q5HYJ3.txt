Function	Negatively regulates the NF-kappa-B-mediated inflammatory pathway by preventing the translocation of HNRNPA2B1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (PubMed:37643469). Inhibits the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa-B pathway-mediated polarization of M1 macrophages by binding to and stabilizing PIK3CD mRNA, resulting in increased levels of PIK3CD protein and increased levels of phosphorylated downstream target AKT which leads to decreased NF-kappa-B signaling (PubMed:38421448).
