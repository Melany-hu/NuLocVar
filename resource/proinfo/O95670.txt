UniprotID	O95670
Accession	O95670;B5MEF0;Q2L6F8;Q5HYU8;Q5RJ63
EntryName	VATG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit G 2 (V-ATPase subunit G 2) (V-ATPase 13 kDa subunit 2) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit G 2)
GeneName	ATP6V1G2 ATP6G ATP6G2 NG38
Length	118
Function	Subunit of the V1 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons. V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment.
Subcellular Location	Melanosome; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane
