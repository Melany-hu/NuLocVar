UniprotID	Q96GF1
Accession	Q96GF1;A8K5C1;A9X3T8;Q8N900
EntryName	RN185_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF185 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 185)
GeneName	RNF185
Length	192
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates selective mitochondrial autophagy by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of BNIP1 (PubMed:21931693). Acts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which targets misfolded proteins that accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation (PubMed:27485036). Protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis (PubMed:27485036). Responsible for the cotranslational ubiquitination and degradation of CFTR in the ERAD pathway (PubMed:24019521). Also acts as a regulator of the innate antiviral response by catalyzing 'Lys-27'-linked polyubiquitination of CGAS at 'Lys-173' and 'Lys-384', thereby promoting CGAS cyclic GMP-AMP synthase activity (PubMed:28273161). Preferentially associates with the E2 enzymes UBE2J1 and UBE2J2 (PubMed:24019521).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
