UniprotID	O75884
Accession	O75884;D3DW31;Q5JPH9;Q9H1D8
EntryName	RBBP9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine hydrolase RBBP9 (EC 3.-.-.-) (B5T-overexpressed gene protein) (Protein BOG) (Retinoblastoma-binding protein 10) (RBBP-10) (Retinoblastoma-binding protein 9) (RBBP-9)
GeneName	RBBP9 BOG RBBP10
Length	186
Function	Serine hydrolase whose substrates have not been identified yet (PubMed:19329999, PubMed:20080647). May negatively regulate basal or autocrine TGF-beta signaling by suppressing SMAD2-SMAD3 phosphorylation (PubMed:20080647). May play a role in the transformation process due to its capacity to confer resistance to the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF-beta through interaction with RB1 and the subsequent displacement of E2F1 (PubMed:9697699).
