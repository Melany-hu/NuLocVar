UniprotID	O95371
Accession	O95371;A0AVA4;Q6IF34;Q6IF55
EntryName	OR2C1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Olfactory receptor 2C1 (OLFmf3) (Olfactory receptor 2C2) (Olfactory receptor OR16-1) (Olfactory receptor OR16-2)
GeneName	OR2C1 OR2C2P
Length	312
Function	Olfactory receptor that is activated by the binding of organosulfur odorants with thioether groups such as (methylthio)methanetiol (MTMT) (By similarity). Also binds odorants acetophenone and benzaldehyde (By similarity). The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylyl cyclase (By similarity). May be involved in the molecular processes underlying fasciculation and targeting of olfactory axons (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
