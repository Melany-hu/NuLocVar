UniprotID	Q9UJM3
Accession	Q9UJM3;B2RDX9;Q9NTG9;Q9UD05
EntryName	ERRFI_HUMAN
ProteinName	ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (Mitogen-inducible gene 6 protein) (MIG-6)
GeneName	ERRFI1 MIG6
Length	462
Function	Negative regulator of EGFR signaling in skin morphogenesis. Acts as a negative regulator for several EGFR family members, including ERBB2, ERBB3 and ERBB4. Inhibits EGFR catalytic activity by interfering with its dimerization. Inhibits autophosphorylation of EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB4. Important for normal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Plays a role in modulating the response to steroid hormones in the uterus. Required for normal response to progesterone in the uterus and for fertility. Mediates epithelial estrogen responses in the uterus by regulating ESR1 levels and activation. Important for regulation of endometrium cell proliferation. Important for normal prenatal and perinatal lung development (By similarity).
