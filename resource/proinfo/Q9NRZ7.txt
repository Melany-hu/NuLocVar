UniprotID	Q9NRZ7
Accession	Q9NRZ7;D3DSL2;Q3ZCU2;Q6UWP6;Q6ZUC6;Q8N3Q7;Q9NRZ6
EntryName	PLCC_HUMAN
ProteinName	1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase gamma (EC 2.3.1.51) (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 3) (1-AGP acyltransferase 3) (1-AGPAT 3) (Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase gamma) (LPAAT-gamma)
GeneName	AGPAT3 LPAAT3 UNQ759/PRO1490
Length	376
Function	Converts 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid or LPA) into 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (phosphatidic acid or PA) by incorporating an acyl moiety at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone (PubMed:21173190). Acts on LPA containing saturated or unsaturated fatty acids C16:0-C20:4 at the sn-1 position using C18:1, C20:4 or C18:2-CoA as the acyl donor (PubMed:21173190). Also acts on lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylserine using C18:1 or C20:4-CoA (PubMed:21173190). Has a preference for arachidonoyl-CoA as a donor (By similarity). Also has a modest lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase (LPIAT) activity, converts lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) into phosphatidylinositol (By similarity).
