UniprotID	Q9NVV9-2
Accession	Q9NVV9;A6NCB6;D3DSY5;H9KV49;Q53FQ1;Q6IA99
EntryName	THAP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	THAP domain-containing protein 1
GeneName	THAP1
Length	53
Function	DNA-binding transcription regulator that regulates endothelial cell proliferation and G1/S cell-cycle progression. Specifically binds the 5'-NTNNGGCA-3' core DNA sequence and acts by modulating expression of pRB-E2F cell-cycle target genes, including RRM1. Component of a THAP1/THAP3-HCFC1-OGT complex that is required for the regulation of the transcriptional activity of RRM1. May also have pro-apoptotic activity by potentiating both serum-withdrawal and TNF-induced apoptosis.
