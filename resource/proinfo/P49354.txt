UniprotID	P49354
Accession	P49354;A6NJW0;Q53XJ9;Q9UDC1
EntryName	FNTA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein farnesyltransferase/geranylgeranyltransferase type-1 subunit alpha (EC 2.5.1.58) (EC 2.5.1.59) (CAAX farnesyltransferase subunit alpha) (FTase-alpha) (Ras proteins prenyltransferase subunit alpha) (Type I protein geranyl-geranyltransferase subunit alpha) (GGTase-I-alpha)
GeneName	FNTA
Length	379
Function	Essential subunit of both the farnesyltransferase and the geranylgeranyltransferase complex. Contributes to the transfer of a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moiety from farnesyl or geranylgeranyl diphosphate to a cysteine at the fourth position from the C-terminus of several proteins having the C-terminal sequence Cys-aliphatic-aliphatic-X. May positively regulate neuromuscular junction development downstream of MUSK via its function in RAC1 prenylation and activation.
