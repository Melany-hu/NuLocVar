UniprotID	H7C4X7
Accession	H7C4X7
EntryName	H7C4X7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuroendocrine protein 7B2 (Secretogranin-5)
GeneName	SCG5
Length	216
Function	Acts as a molecular chaperone for PCSK2/PC2, preventing its premature activation in the regulated secretory pathway. Binds to inactive PCSK2 in the endoplasmic reticulum and facilitates its transport from there to later compartments of the secretory pathway where it is proteolytically matured and activated. Also required for cleavage of PCSK2 but does not appear to be involved in its folding. Plays a role in regulating pituitary hormone secretion. The C-terminal peptide inhibits PCSK2 in vitro.
