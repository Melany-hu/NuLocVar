UniprotID	P19652
Accession	P19652;B2R5L2;Q16571;Q5T538;Q6IB74
EntryName	A1AG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 2 (AGP 2) (Orosomucoid-2) (OMD 2)
GeneName	ORM2 AGP2
Length	201
Function	Functions as a transport protein in the blood stream. Binds various hydrophobic ligands in the interior of its beta-barrel domain. Also binds synthetic drugs and influences their distribution and availability. Appears to function in modulating the activity of the immune system during the acute-phase reaction.
