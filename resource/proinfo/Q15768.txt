UniprotID	Q15768
Accession	Q15768;B2RBW2;D3DTQ6;O00680;Q8TBH7;Q92875
EntryName	EFNB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ephrin-B3 (EPH-related receptor transmembrane ligand ELK-L3) (EPH-related receptor tyrosine kinase ligand 8) (LERK-8)
GeneName	EFNB3 EPLG8 LERK8
Length	340
Function	Cell surface transmembrane ligand for Eph receptors, a family of receptor tyrosine kinases which are crucial for migration, repulsion and adhesion during neuronal, vascular and epithelial development. Binds promiscuously Eph receptors residing on adjacent cells, leading to contact-dependent bidirectional signaling into neighboring cells. The signaling pathway downstream of the receptor is referred to as forward signaling while the signaling pathway downstream of the ephrin ligand is referred to as reverse signaling. May play a pivotal role in forebrain function. Binds to, and induce the collapse of, commissural axons/growth cones in vitro. May play a role in constraining the orientation of longitudinally projecting axons (By similarity).
