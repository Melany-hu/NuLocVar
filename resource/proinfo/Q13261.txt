Accession	Q13261;B4E2C2;Q3B769;Q5JVA1;Q5JVA2;Q5JVA4;Q6B0J2;Q7LDR4;Q7Z609
EntryName	I15RA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-15 receptor subunit alpha (IL-15 receptor subunit alpha) (IL-15R-alpha) (IL-15RA) (CD antigen CD215) [Cleaved into: Soluble interleukin-15 receptor subunit alpha (sIL-15 receptor subunit alpha) (sIL-15R-alpha) (sIL-15RA)]
GeneName	IL15RA
Length	267
Function	High-affinity receptor for interleukin-15 (PubMed:8530383). Can signal both in cis and trans where IL15R from one subset of cells presents IL15 to neighboring IL2RG-expressing cells (By similarity). In neutrophils, binds and activates kinase SYK in response to IL15 stimulation (PubMed:15123770). In neutrophils, required for IL15-induced phagocytosis in a SYK-dependent manner (PubMed:15123770). Expression of different isoforms may alter or interfere with signal transduction (PubMed:10480910).
