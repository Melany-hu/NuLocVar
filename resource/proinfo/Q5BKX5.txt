UniprotID	Q5BKX5
Accession	Q5BKX5;A8MSZ5;B4DNU7
EntryName	ACTMP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Actin maturation protease (EC 3.4.11.-) (Actin aminopeptidase ACTMAP)
GeneName	ACTMAP C19orf54
Length	351
Function	Actin maturation protease that specifically mediates the cleavage of immature acetylated N-terminal actin, thereby contributing to actin maturation (PubMed:36173861). Cleaves N-terminal acetylated methionine of immature cytoplasmic beta- and gamma-actins ACTB and ACTG1 after translation (PubMed:36173861). Cleaves N-terminal acetylated cysteine of muscle alpha-actins ACTA1, ACTC1 and ACTA2 after canonical removal of N-terminal methionine (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
