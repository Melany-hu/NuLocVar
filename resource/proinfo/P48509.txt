EntryName	CD151_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD151 antigen (GP27) (Membrane glycoprotein SFA-1) (Platelet-endothelial tetraspan antigen 3) (PETA-3) (Tetraspanin-24) (Tspan-24) (CD antigen CD151)
GeneName	CD151 TSPAN24
Length	253
Function	Structural component of specialized membrane microdomains known as tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TERMs), which act as platforms for receptor clustering and signaling. Plays a role in various cellular and molecular mechanism through its association with both integrin and non-integrin proteins. These interactions facilitate critical cellular functions, including cell-to-cell communication, wound healing, platelet aggregation, trafficking, cell motility, and angiogenesis (PubMed:17045834, PubMed:24723389, PubMed:31488507). Via interaction with JAM-A/F11R and integrin ITGA3:ITGB1, promotes the recruitment of signaling molecules such as RAC1, CDC42 and RhoGTPases to facilitate the polarization of epithelial cells and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which are critical steps in cell migration process (PubMed:22843693, PubMed:35067832). Regulates the glycosylation pattern of ITGA3:ITGB1 thereby modulating its activity (PubMed:18852263). Plays an essential role in the maintenance of central laminin-binding integrin ITGA6:ITGB4-containing adhesion complexes (PubMed:31488507). Essential for the proper assembly of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes in kidney (PubMed:15265795). Contributes to T-cell activation by modulating integrin signaling leading to activation of downstream targets PTK2 and MAPK1/MAPK3 (PubMed:24723389).
