UniprotID	O94817
Accession	O94817;Q6PJV2
EntryName	ATG12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-like protein ATG12 (Autophagy-related protein 12) (APG12-like)
GeneName	ATG12 APG12 APG12L
Length	140
Function	Ubiquitin-like protein involved in autophagy vesicles formation. Conjugation with ATG5 through a ubiquitin-like conjugating system involving also ATG7 as an E1-like activating enzyme and ATG10 as an E2-like conjugating enzyme, is essential for its function. The ATG12-ATG5 conjugate acts as an E3-like enzyme which is required for lipidation of ATG8 family proteins and their association to the vesicle membranes. As part of the ATG8 conjugation system with ATG5 and ATG16L1, required for recruitment of LRRK2 to stressed lysosomes and induction of LRRK2 kinase activity in response to lysosomal stress (By similarity).
