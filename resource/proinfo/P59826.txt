UniprotID	P59826
Accession	P59826;Q5TDX7
EntryName	BPIB3_HUMAN
ProteinName	BPI fold-containing family B member 3 (Ligand-binding protein RYA3) (Long palate, lung and nasal epithelium carcinoma-associated protein 3)
GeneName	BPIFB3 C20orf185 LPLUNC3
Length	472
Function	May have the capacity to recognize and bind specific classes of odorants. May act as a carrier molecule, transporting odorants across the mucus layer to access receptor sites. May serve as a primary defense mechanism by recognizing and removing potentially harmful odorants or pathogenic microorganisms from the mucosa or clearing excess odorant from mucus to enable new odorant stimuli to be received (By similarity).
