EntryName	BCL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Apoptosis regulator Bcl-2
GeneName	BCL2
Length	239
Function	Suppresses apoptosis in a variety of cell systems including factor-dependent lymphohematopoietic and neural cells (PubMed:1508712, PubMed:8183370). Regulates cell death by controlling the mitochondrial membrane permeability (PubMed:11368354). Appears to function in a feedback loop system with caspases (PubMed:11368354). Inhibits caspase activity either by preventing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and/or by binding to the apoptosis-activating factor (APAF-1) (PubMed:11368354). Also acts as an inhibitor of autophagy: interacts with BECN1 and AMBRA1 during non-starvation conditions and inhibits their autophagy function (PubMed:18570871, PubMed:20889974, PubMed:21358617). May attenuate inflammation by impairing NLRP1-inflammasome activation, hence CASP1 activation and IL1B release (PubMed:17418785).
