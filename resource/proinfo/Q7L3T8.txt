UniprotID	Q7L3T8
Accession	Q7L3T8;A8K0W4;Q9H6S5;Q9UFT1
EntryName	SYPM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable proline--tRNA ligase, mitochondrial (EC 6.1.1.15) (Prolyl-tRNA synthetase) (ProRS) (Prolyl-tRNA synthetase 2, mitochondrial)
GeneName	PARS2
Length	475
Function	Mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that catalyzes the specific attachment of the proline amino acid (aa) to the homologous transfer RNA (tRNA), further participating in protein synthesis. The reaction occurs in a two steps: proline is first activated by ATP to form Pro-AMP and then transferred to the acceptor end of tRNA(Pro).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
