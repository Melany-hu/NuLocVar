UniprotID	Q9H1D9

EntryName	RPC6_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC6 (RNA polymerase III subunit C6) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit F) (RNA polymerase III 39 kDa subunit) (RPC39)
GeneName	POLR3F
Length	316
Function	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates (PubMed:20413673, PubMed:21358628, PubMed:33558764, PubMed:34675218). Specific peripheric component of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) which synthesizes small non-coding RNAs including 5S rRNA, snRNAs, tRNAs and miRNAs from at least 500 distinct genomic loci. Part of POLR3C/RPC3-POLR3F/RPC6-POLR3G/RPC7 heterotrimer that coordinates the dynamics of Pol III stalk and clamp modules during the transition from apo to elongation state (PubMed:20413673, PubMed:33558764, PubMed:33558766). Pol III plays a key role in sensing and limiting infection by intracellular bacteria and DNA viruses, including varicella zoster virus. Acts as a nuclear and cytosolic DNA sensor detecting AT-rich DNA, involved in innate immune response. Can sense non-self dsDNA that serves as template for transcription into dsRNA. The non-self RNA polymerase III transcripts, such as Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNAs (EBERs) induce type I interferon and NF-kappa-B through the RIG-I pathway (PubMed:19609254, PubMed:19631370, PubMed:30211253). Preferentially binds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (PubMed:21358628).
