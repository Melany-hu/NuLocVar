Accession	Q9P0L9;O75972;Q5W039;Q9UP35;Q9UPA2
EntryName	PK2L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polycystin-2-like protein 1 (Polycystin-2L1) (Polycystic kidney disease 2-like 1 protein) (Polycystin-2 homolog) (Polycystin-L) (Polycystin-L1)
GeneName	PKD2L1 PKD2L PKDL TRPP3
Length	805
Function	Homotetrameric, non-selective cation channel that is permeable to sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium (PubMed:10517637, PubMed:11959145, PubMed:25820328, PubMed:27754867, PubMed:29425510, PubMed:30004384). Also forms functionnal heteromeric channels with PKD1, PKD1L1 and PKD1L3 (PubMed:23212381, PubMed:24336289). Pore-forming subunit of a heterotetrameric, non-selective cation channel, formed by PKD1L2 and PKD1L3, that is permeable to sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium and which may act as a sour taste receptor in gustatory cells; however, its contribution to sour taste perception is unclear in vivo and may be indirect (PubMed:19812697, PubMed:23212381). The homomeric and heteromeric channels formed by PKD1L2 and PKD1L3 are activated by low pH and Ca(2+), but opens only when the extracellular pH rises again and after the removal of acid stimulus (PubMed:23212381). Pore-forming subunit of a calcium-permeant ion channel formed by PKD1L2 and PKD1L1 in primary cilia, where it controls cilium calcium concentration, without affecting cytoplasmic calcium concentration, and regulates sonic hedgehog/SHH signaling and GLI2 transcription (PubMed:24336289). The PKD1L1:PKD2L1 complex channel is mechanosensitive only at high pressures and is highly temperature sensitive (PubMed:24336289). Pore-forming subunit of a calcium-permeant ion channel formed by PKD1L2 and PKD1 that produces a transient increase in intracellular calcium concentration upon hypo-osmotic stimulation (200 mOsm) (By similarity). May play a role in the perception of carbonation taste (By similarity). May play a role in the sensory perception of water, via a mechanism that activates the channel in response to dilution of salivary bicarbonate and changes in salivary pH (By similarity).
