EntryName	SMYD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-lysine methyltransferase SMYD2 (EC 2.1.1.-) (HSKM-B) (Histone methyltransferase SMYD2) (EC 2.1.1.354) (Lysine N-methyltransferase 3C) (SET and MYND domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	SMYD2 KMT3C
Length	433
Function	Protein-lysine N-methyltransferase that methylates both histones and non-histone proteins, including p53/TP53 and RB1. Specifically trimethylates histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3) in vivo. The activity requires interaction with HSP90alpha. Shows even higher methyltransferase activity on p53/TP53. Monomethylates 'Lys-370' of p53/TP53, leading to decreased DNA-binding activity and subsequent transcriptional regulation activity of p53/TP53. Monomethylates RB1 at 'Lys-860'.
