EntryName	PI42A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase type-2 alpha (EC 2.7.1.149) (1-phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase 2-alpha) (Diphosphoinositide kinase 2-alpha) (PIP5KIII) (Phosphatidylinositol 5-Phosphate 4-Kinase) (PI5P4Kalpha) (Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase type II alpha) (PI(5)P 4-kinase type II alpha) (PIP4KII-alpha) (PtdIns(4)P-5-kinase B isoform) (PtdIns(4)P-5-kinase C isoform) (PtdIns(5)P-4-kinase isoform 2-alpha)
GeneName	PIP4K2A PI5P4KA PIP5K2 PIP5K2A
Length	406
Function	Catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns5P) on the fourth hydroxyl of the myo-inositol ring, to form phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) (PubMed:23326584, PubMed:9367159). Has both ATP- and GTP-dependent kinase activities (PubMed:26774281). May exert its function by regulating the levels of PtdIns5P, which functions in the cytosol by increasing AKT activity and in the nucleus signals through ING2 (PubMed:18364242). May regulate the pool of cytosolic PtdIns5P in response to the activation of tyrosine phosphorylation (By similarity). Required for lysosome-peroxisome membrane contacts and intracellular cholesterol transport through modulating peroxisomal PtdIns(4,5)P2 level (PubMed:29353240). In collaboration with PIP4K2B, has a role in mediating autophagy in times of nutrient stress (By similarity). Required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion and the regulation of cellular lipid metabolism (PubMed:31091439). May be involved in thrombopoiesis, and the terminal maturation of megakaryocytes and regulation of their size (By similarity). Negatively regulates insulin signaling through a catalytic-independent mechanism (PubMed:31091439). PIP4Ks interact with PIP5Ks and suppress PIP5K-mediated PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis and insulin-dependent conversion to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PubMed:31091439).
