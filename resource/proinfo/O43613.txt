UniprotID	O43613
Accession	O43613;A8K3A6;Q9HBV6
EntryName	OX1R_HUMAN
ProteinName	Orexin/Hypocretin receptor type 1 (Hypocretin receptor type 1) (Orexin receptor type 1) (Ox-1-R) (Ox1-R) (Ox1R)
GeneName	HCRTR1
Length	425
Function	Moderately selective excitatory receptor for orexin-A and, with a lower affinity, for orexin-B neuropeptide (PubMed:26950369, PubMed:9491897). Triggers an increase in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) levels in response to orexin-A binding (PubMed:26950369, PubMed:9491897).
