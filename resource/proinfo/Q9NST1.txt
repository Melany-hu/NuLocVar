EntryName	PLPL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase PNPLA3 (EC 2.3.1.51) (Acylglycerol transacylase) (Adiponutrin) (ADPN) (Calcium-independent phospholipase A2-epsilon) (iPLA2-epsilon) (EC 3.1.1.4) (Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase) (Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3) (EC 3.1.1.3)
GeneName	PNPLA3 ADPN C22orf20
Length	481
Function	Specifically catalyzes coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent acylation of 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (2-lysophosphatidic acid/LPA) to generate phosphatidic acid (PA), an important metabolic intermediate and precursor for both triglycerides and glycerophospholipids. Does not esterify other lysophospholipids. Acyl donors are long chain (at least C16) fatty acyl-CoAs: arachidonoyl-CoA, linoleoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA and at a lesser extent palmitoyl-CoA (PubMed:22560221). Additionally possesses low triacylglycerol lipase and CoA-independent acylglycerol transacylase activities and thus may play a role in acyl-chain remodeling of triglycerides (PubMed:15364929, PubMed:20034933, PubMed:22560221). In vitro may express hydrolytic activity against glycerolipids triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol, with a strong preference for oleic acid as the acyl moiety (PubMed:21878620). However, the triacylglycerol hydrolase activity is controversial and may be very low (PubMed:22560221). Possesses phospholipase A2 activity (PubMed:15364929).
