EntryName	ATX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ataxin-3 (EC 3.4.19.12) (Machado-Joseph disease protein 1) (Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 protein)
GeneName	ATXN3 ATX3 MJD MJD1 SCA3
Length	361
Function	Deubiquitinating enzyme involved in protein homeostasis maintenance, transcription, cytoskeleton regulation, myogenesis and degradation of misfolded chaperone substrates (PubMed:12297501, PubMed:16118278, PubMed:17696782, PubMed:23625928, PubMed:28445460, PubMed:33157014). Binds long polyubiquitin chains and trims them, while it has weak or no activity against chains of 4 or less ubiquitins (PubMed:17696782). Involved in degradation of misfolded chaperone substrates via its interaction with STUB1/CHIP: recruited to monoubiquitinated STUB1/CHIP, and restricts the length of ubiquitin chain attached to STUB1/CHIP substrates and preventing further chain extension (By similarity). Interacts with key regulators of transcription and represses transcription: acts as a histone-binding protein that regulates transcription (PubMed:12297501). Acts as a negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling in response to amino acid deprivation by mediating deubiquitination of RHEB, thereby promoting RHEB inactivation by the TSC-TBC complex (PubMed:33157014). Regulates autophagy via the deubiquitination of 'Lys-402' of BECN1 leading to the stabilization of BECN1 (PubMed:28445460).
