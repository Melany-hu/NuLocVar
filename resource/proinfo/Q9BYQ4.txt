UniprotID	Q9BYQ4
Accession	Q9BYQ4;Q17RK8;Q2TB15;Q6ISF6
EntryName	KRA92_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 9-2 (Keratin-associated protein 9.2) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 9.2)
GeneName	KRTAP9-2 KAP9.2 KRTAP9.2
Length	174
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
