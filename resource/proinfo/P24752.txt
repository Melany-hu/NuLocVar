ProteinName	Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, mitochondrial (EC 2.3.1.9) (Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase) (T2)
GeneName	ACAT1 ACAT MAT
Length	427
Function	This is one of the enzymes that catalyzes the last step of the mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathway, an aerobic process breaking down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA (PubMed:1715688, PubMed:7728148, PubMed:9744475). Using free coenzyme A/CoA, catalyzes the thiolytic cleavage of medium- to long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoAs into acetyl-CoA and a fatty acyl-CoA shortened by two carbon atoms (PubMed:1715688, PubMed:7728148, PubMed:9744475). The activity of the enzyme is reversible and it can also catalyze the condensation of two acetyl-CoA molecules into acetoacetyl-CoA (PubMed:17371050). Thereby, it plays a major role in ketone body metabolism (PubMed:1715688, PubMed:17371050, PubMed:7728148, PubMed:9744475).
