UniprotID	P24863
Accession	P24863;B4DPZ1;Q9H543
EntryName	CCNC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-C (SRB11 homolog) (hSRB11)
GeneName	CCNC
Length	283
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in regulated gene transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors. Binds to and activates cyclin-dependent kinase CDK8 that phosphorylates the CTD (C-terminal domain) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAp II), which may inhibit the formation of a transcription initiation complex.
