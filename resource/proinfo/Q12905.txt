EntryName	ILF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2 (Nuclear factor of activated T-cells 45 kDa)
GeneName	ILF2 NF45 PRO3063
Length	390
Function	Chromatin-interacting protein that forms a stable heterodimer with interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3/ILF3 and plays a role in several biological processes including transcription, innate immunity or cell growth (PubMed:18458058, PubMed:31212927). Essential for the efficient reshuttling of ILF3 (isoform 1 and isoform 2) into the nucleus. Together with ILF3, forms an RNA-binding complex that is required for mitotic progression and cytokinesis by regulating the expression of a cluster of mitotic genes. Mechanistically, competes with STAU1/STAU2-mediated mRNA decay (PubMed:32433969). Also plays a role in the inhibition of various viruses including Japanese encephalitis virus or enterovirus 71.
