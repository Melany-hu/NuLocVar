UniprotID	Q9NUU7
Accession	Q9NUU7;B2RPL0;B4DRZ7;Q53FM0
EntryName	DD19A_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX19A (EC 3.6.4.13) (DDX19-like protein) (DEAD box protein 19A)
GeneName	DDX19A DDX19L
Length	478
Function	ATP-dependent RNA helicase involved in mRNA export from the nucleus. Rather than unwinding RNA duplexes, DDX19 functions as a remodeler of ribonucleoprotein particles, whereby proteins bound to nuclear mRNA are dissociated and replaced by cytoplasmic mRNA binding proteins.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Nucleoplasm
