EntryName	ENOA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-enolase (EC 4.2.1.11) (2-phospho-D-glycerate hydro-lyase) (C-myc promoter-binding protein) (Enolase 1) (MBP-1) (MPB-1) (Non-neural enolase) (NNE) (Phosphopyruvate hydratase) (Plasminogen-binding protein)
GeneName	ENO1 ENO1L1 MBPB1 MPB1
Length	434
Function	Glycolytic enzyme the catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PubMed:1369209, PubMed:29775581). In addition to glycolysis, involved in various processes such as growth control, hypoxia tolerance and allergic responses (PubMed:10802057, PubMed:12666133, PubMed:2005901, PubMed:29775581). May also function in the intravascular and pericellular fibrinolytic system due to its ability to serve as a receptor and activator of plasminogen on the cell surface of several cell-types such as leukocytes and neurons (PubMed:12666133). Stimulates immunoglobulin production (PubMed:1369209).
