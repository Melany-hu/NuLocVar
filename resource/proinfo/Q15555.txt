EntryName	MARE2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 2 (APC-binding protein EB2) (End-binding protein 2) (EB2)
GeneName	MAPRE2 RP1
Length	327
Function	Adapter protein that is involved in microtubule polymerization, and spindle function by stabilizing microtubules and anchoring them at centrosomes. Therefore, ensures mitotic progression and genome stability (PubMed:27030108). Acts as a central regulator of microtubule reorganization in apico-basal epithelial differentiation (By similarity). Plays a role during oocyte meiosis by regulating microtubule dynamics (By similarity). Participates in neurite growth by interacting with plexin B3/PLXNB3 and microtubule reorganization during apico-basal epithelial differentiation (PubMed:22373814). Also plays an essential role for cell migration and focal adhesion dynamics. Mechanistically, recruits HAX1 to microtubules in order to regulate focal adhesion dynamics (PubMed:26527684).
