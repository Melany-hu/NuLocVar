ProteinName	Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 22 (EC 3.4.19.12) (Deubiquitinating enzyme 22) (Ubiquitin thioesterase 22) (Ubiquitin-specific-processing protease 22)
GeneName	USP22 KIAA1063 USP3L
Length	525
Function	Deubiquitinase that plays a role in several cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression or innate immunity. As part of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA, catalyzes the deubiquitination of both histones H2A and H2B, thereby acting as a transcriptional coactivator (PubMed:18206972, PubMed:18206973, PubMed:18469533). Recruited to specific gene promoters by activators such as MYC, where it is required for transcription. Facilitates cell-cycle progression by stabilizing CCNB1 and antagonizing its proteasome-mediated degradation in a cell cycle-specific manner (PubMed:27030811). Modulates cell cycle progression and apoptosis also by antagonizing TP53 transcriptional activation through deacetylase SIRT1 stabilization (PubMed:22542455). Plays multiple roles in immunity and inflammation. Participates in antiviral response by deubiquitinating the importin KPNA2, leading to IRF3 nuclear translocation and subsequent type I interferon production (PubMed:32130408). Acts as a central regulator of type III IFN signaling by negatively regulating STING1 activation and ubiquitination (PubMed:35933402). Inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation by promoting NLRP3 degradation through ATG5-dependent autophagy (By similarity). Deubiquitinates CD274 to induce its stabilization and thereby participates in maintenance of immune tolerance to self (PubMed:31399419). Controls necroptotic cell death by regulating RIPK3 phosphorylation and ubiquitination (PubMed:33369872). During bacterial infection, promotes pro-inflammatory response by targeting TRAF6 and removing its 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination (By similarity).
