UniprotID	Q8IYM9
Accession	Q8IYM9;Q05CQ0;Q15521
EntryName	TRI22_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM22 (EC 2.3.2.27) (50 kDa-stimulated trans-acting factor) (RING finger protein 94) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase TRIM22) (Staf-50) (Tripartite motif-containing protein 22)
GeneName	TRIM22 RNF94 STAF50
Length	498
Function	Interferon-induced E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays important roles in innate and adaptive immunity (PubMed:25683609, PubMed:35777501). Restricts the replication of many viruses including HIV-1, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or Zika virus (ZIKV) (PubMed:25683609, PubMed:35777501, PubMed:36042495). Mechanistically, negatively regulates HCV replication by promoting ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of viral NS5A (PubMed:25683609). Also acts by promoting the degradation of Zika virus NS1 and NS3 proteins through proteasomal degradation (PubMed:36042495). Acts as a suppressor of basal HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription by preventing Sp1 binding to the HIV-1 promoter (PubMed:26683615). Also plays a role in antiviral immunity by co-regulating together with NT5C2 the RIGI/NF-kappa-B pathway by promoting 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of RIGI, while NT5C2 is responsible for 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination of RIGI (PubMed:36159777). Participates in adaptive immunity by suppressing the amount of MHC class II protein in a negative feedback manner in order to limit the extent of MHC class II induction (PubMed:35777501).
