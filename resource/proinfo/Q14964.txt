UniprotID	Q14964
Accession	Q14964;A8KAA4;Q8N6W2
EntryName	RB39A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-39A (Rab-39)
GeneName	RAB39A RAB39
Length	217
Function	Plays a role in the maturation and acidification of phagosomes that engulf pathogens, such as S.aureus and M.tuberculosis. Plays a role in vesicular trafficking. Plays a role in the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes. Negatively regulates LPS-induced autophagosome formation in macrophages possibly by implicating PI3K (PubMed:24349490). May be involved in multiple neurite formation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Phagosome; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Phagosome membrane; Lysosome
