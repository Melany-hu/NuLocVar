UniprotID	Q16671
Accession	Q16671;A0AVE1;B9EGB7;E9PGD2;F8W1D2;Q13762;Q647K2
EntryName	AMHR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Anti-Muellerian hormone type-2 receptor (EC 2.7.11.30) (Anti-Muellerian hormone type II receptor) (AMH type II receptor) (MIS type II receptor) (MISRII) (MRII)
GeneName	AMHR2 AMHR MISR2
Length	573
Function	On ligand binding, forms a receptor complex consisting of two type II and two type I transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. Type II receptors phosphorylate and activate type I receptors which autophosphorylate, then bind and activate SMAD transcriptional regulators. Receptor for anti-Muellerian hormone.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
