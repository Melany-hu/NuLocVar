UniprotID	P07686
Accession	P07686
EntryName	HEXB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-hexosaminidase subunit beta (EC 3.2.1.52) (Beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase subunit beta) (Hexosaminidase subunit B) (Cervical cancer proto-oncogene 7 protein) (HCC-7) (N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase subunit beta) [Cleaved into: Beta-hexosaminidase subunit beta chain B; Beta-hexosaminidase subunit beta chain A]
GeneName	HEXB HCC7
Length	556
Function	Hydrolyzes the non-reducing end N-acetyl-D-hexosamine and/or sulfated N-acetyl-D-hexosamine of glycoconjugates, such as the oligosaccharide moieties from proteins and neutral glycolipids, or from certain mucopolysaccharides (PubMed:11707436, PubMed:8123671, PubMed:8672428, PubMed:9694901). The isozyme B does not hydrolyze each of these substrates, however hydrolyzes efficiently neutral oligosaccharide (PubMed:11707436). Only the isozyme A is responsible for the degradation of GM2 gangliosides in the presence of GM2A (PubMed:8123671, PubMed:8672428, PubMed:9694901). During fertilization is responsible, at least in part, for the zona block to polyspermy. Present in the cortical granules of non-activated oocytes, is exocytosed during the cortical reaction in response to oocyte activation and inactivates the sperm galactosyltransferase-binding site, accounting for the block in sperm binding to the zona pellucida (By similarity).
