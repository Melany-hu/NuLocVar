Accession	Q9UH99;B0QY62;O75156;Q2NKN8;Q2T9F7;Q504T5;Q6B4H1;Q7Z3E3
EntryName	SUN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	SUN domain-containing protein 2 (Protein unc-84 homolog B) (Rab5-interacting protein) (Rab5IP) (Sad1/unc-84 protein-like 2)
GeneName	SUN2 FRIGG KIAA0668 RAB5IP UNC84B
Length	738
Function	As a component of the LINC (LInker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, involved in the connection between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton. The nucleocytoplasmic interactions established by the LINC complex play an important role in the transmission of mechanical forces across the nuclear envelope and in nuclear movement and positioning. Specifically, SYNE2 and SUN2 assemble in arrays of transmembrane actin-associated nuclear (TAN) lines which are bound to F-actin cables and couple the nucleus to retrograde actin flow during actin-dependent nuclear movement. Required for interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) and essential for nucleokinesis and centrosome-nucleus coupling during radial neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex and during glial migration. Required for nuclear migration in retinal photoreceptor progenitors implicating association with cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin and kinesin motor complexes, and probably B-type lamins; SUN1 and SUN2 seem to act redundantly. The SUN1/2:KASH5 LINC complex couples telomeres to microtubules during meiosis; SUN1 and SUN2 seem to act at least partial redundantly. Anchors chromosome movement in the prophase of meiosis and is involved in selective gene expression of coding and non-coding RNAs needed for gametogenesis. Required for telomere attachment to nuclear envelope and gametogenesis. May also function on endocytic vesicles as a receptor for RAB5-GDP and participate in the activation of RAB5.
