UniprotID	Q9Y294
Accession	Q9Y294;Q6IA08;Q9P014
EntryName	ASF1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone chaperone ASF1A (Anti-silencing function protein 1 homolog A) (hAsf1) (hAsf1a) (CCG1-interacting factor A) (CIA) (hCIA)
GeneName	ASF1A CGI-98 HSPC146
Length	204
Function	Histone chaperone that facilitates histone deposition and histone exchange and removal during nucleosome assembly and disassembly (PubMed:10759893, PubMed:11897662, PubMed:12842904, PubMed:14718166, PubMed:15664198, PubMed:16151251, PubMed:21454524). Cooperates with chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) to promote replication-dependent chromatin assembly and with HIRA to promote replication-independent chromatin assembly (PubMed:11897662, PubMed:14718166, PubMed:15664198). Promotes homologous recombination-mediated repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) at stalled or collapsed replication forks: acts by mediating histone replacement at DSBs, leading to recruitment of the MMS22L-TONSL complex and subsequent loading of RAD51 (PubMed:29478807). Also involved in the nuclear import of the histone H3-H4 dimer together with importin-4 (IPO4): specifically recognizes and binds newly synthesized histones with the monomethylation of H3 'Lys-9' and acetylation at 'Lys-14' (H3K9me1K14ac) marks, and diacetylation at 'Lys-5' and 'Lys-12' of H4 (H4K5K12ac) marks in the cytosol (PubMed:21454524, PubMed:29408485). Required for the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) and efficient senescence-associated cell cycle exit (PubMed:15621527).
