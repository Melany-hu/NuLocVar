UniprotID	Q8NHW3
Accession	Q8NHW3
EntryName	MAFA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor MafA (Pancreatic beta-cell-specific transcriptional activator) (RIPE3b1 factor) (V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A)
GeneName	MAFA
Length	353
Function	Transcription factor that activates insulin gene expression (PubMed:12011435, PubMed:15993959). Acts synergistically with NEUROD1/BETA2 and PDX1 (PubMed:15993959). Binds the insulin enhancer C1/RIPE3b element (PubMed:12011435). Binds to consensus TRE-type MARE 5'-TGCTGACTCAGCA-3' DNA sequence (PubMed:23148532, PubMed:29339498).
