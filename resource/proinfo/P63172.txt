UniprotID	P63172
Accession	P63172;Q15763;Q5VTU4
EntryName	DYLT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynein light chain Tctex-type 1 (Protein CW-1) (T-complex testis-specific protein 1 homolog)
GeneName	DYNLT1 TCTEL1 TCTEX-1 TCTEX1
Length	113
Function	Acts as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex that are thought to be involved in linking dynein to cargos and to adapter proteins that regulate dynein function. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. Binds to transport cargos and is involved in apical cargo transport such as rhodopsin-bearing vesicles in polarized epithelia. May also be a accessory component of axonemal dynein.
