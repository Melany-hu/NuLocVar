UniprotID	Q92903
Accession	Q92903;B2RAL5;O00163
EntryName	CDS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase 1 (EC 2.7.7.41) (CDP-DAG synthase 1) (CDP-DG synthase 1) (CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 1) (CDS 1) (CDP-diglyceride pyrophosphorylase 1) (CDP-diglyceride synthase 1) (CTP:phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase 1)
GeneName	CDS1 CDS
Length	461
Function	Catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid (PA) to CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), an essential intermediate in the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin and phosphatidylinositol (PubMed:25375833, PubMed:9407135). Exhibits almost no acyl chain preference for PA, showing no discrimination for the sn-1/sn-2 acyl chain composition of PAs (PubMed:25375833). Plays an important role in regulating the growth of lipid droplets which are storage organelles at the center of lipid and energy homeostasis (PubMed:26946540, PubMed:31548309). Positively regulates the differentiation and development of adipocytes (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
