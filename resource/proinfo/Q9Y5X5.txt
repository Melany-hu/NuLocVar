UniprotID	Q9Y5X5
Accession	Q9Y5X5;Q96RV1;Q9NR49
EntryName	NPFF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuropeptide FF receptor 2 (G-protein coupled receptor 74) (G-protein coupled receptor HLWAR77) (Neuropeptide G-protein coupled receptor)
GeneName	NPFFR2 GPR74 NPFF2 NPGPR
Length	522
Function	Receptor for NPAF (A-18-F-amide) and NPFF (F-8-F-amide) neuropeptides, also known as morphine-modulating peptides. Can also be activated by a variety of naturally occurring or synthetic FMRF-amide like ligands. This receptor mediates its action by association with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
