EntryName	CERS3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ceramide synthase 3 (CerS3) (Dihydroceramide synthase 3) (LAG1 longevity assurance homolog 3) (Sphingosine N-acyltransferase CERS3) (EC 2.3.1.24) (Ultra-long-chain ceramide synthase CERS3) (EC 2.3.1.298) (Very-long-chain ceramide synthase CERS3) (EC 2.3.1.297)
GeneName	CERS3 LASS3
Length	383
Function	Ceramide synthase that catalyzes the transfer of the acyl chain from acyl-CoA to a sphingoid base, with high selectivity toward very- and ultra-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA (chain length greater than C22) (PubMed:17977534, PubMed:22038835, PubMed:26887952). N-acylates sphinganine and sphingosine bases to form dihydroceramides and ceramides in de novo synthesis and salvage pathways, respectively (PubMed:17977534, PubMed:22038835, PubMed:26887952). It is crucial for the synthesis of ultra-long-chain ceramides in the epidermis, to maintain epidermal lipid homeostasis and terminal differentiation (PubMed:23754960).
