UniprotID	Q68DK7-3
Accession	Q68DK7;Q0VF46;Q69Z03
EntryName	MSL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Male-specific lethal 1 homolog (MSL-1) (Male-specific lethal 1-like 1) (MSL1-like 1) (Male-specific lethal-1 homolog 1)
GeneName	MSL1 MSL1L1
Length	351
Function	Non-catalytic component of the MSL histone acetyltransferase complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates the majority of histone H4 acetylation at 'Lys-16' (H4K16ac), an epigenetic mark that prevents chromatin compaction (PubMed:16227571, PubMed:16543150, PubMed:33837287). The MSL complex is required for chromosome stability and genome integrity by maintaining homeostatic levels of H4K16ac (PubMed:33837287). The MSL complex is also involved in gene dosage by promoting up-regulation of genes expressed by the X chromosome (By similarity). X up-regulation is required to compensate for autosomal biallelic expression (By similarity). The MSL complex also participates in gene dosage compensation by promoting expression of Tsix non-coding RNA (By similarity). Within the MSL complex, acts as a scaffold to tether MSL3 and KAT8 together for enzymatic activity regulation (PubMed:22547026). Greatly enhances MSL2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, promoting monoubiquitination of histone H2B at 'Lys-34' (H2BK34Ub) (PubMed:21726816, PubMed:30930284). This modification in turn stimulates histone H3 methylation at 'Lys-4' (H3K4me) and 'Lys-79' (H3K79me) and leads to gene activation, including that of HOXA9 and MEIS1 (PubMed:21726816).
