ProteinName	Histone acetyltransferase KAT2A (EC 2.3.1.48) (General control of amino acid synthesis protein 5-like 2) (Histone acetyltransferase GCN5) (hGCN5) (Histone glutaryltransferase KAT2A) (EC 2.3.1.-) (Histone succinyltransferase KAT2A) (EC 2.3.1.-) (Lysine acetyltransferase 2A) (STAF97)

Length	837
Function	Protein lysine acyltransferase that can act as a acetyltransferase, glutaryltransferase, succinyltransferase or malonyltransferase, depending on the context (PubMed:29211711, PubMed:35995428). Acts as a histone lysine succinyltransferase: catalyzes succinylation of histone H3 on 'Lys-79' (H3K79succ), with a maximum frequency around the transcription start sites of genes (PubMed:29211711). Succinylation of histones gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcription activation (PubMed:29211711). Association with the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, which provides succinyl-CoA, is required for histone succinylation (PubMed:29211711). In different complexes, functions either as an acetyltransferase (HAT) or as a succinyltransferase: in the SAGA and ATAC complexes, acts as a histone acetyltransferase (PubMed:17301242, PubMed:19103755, PubMed:29211711). Has significant histone acetyltransferase activity with core histones, but not with nucleosome core particles (PubMed:17301242, PubMed:19103755, PubMed:21131905). Has a a strong preference for acetylation of H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9ac) (PubMed:21131905). Acetylation of histones gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcription activation (PubMed:17301242, PubMed:19103755, PubMed:29211711). Recruited by the XPC complex at promoters, where it specifically mediates acetylation of histone variant H2A.Z.1/H2A.Z, thereby promoting expression of target genes (PubMed:29973595, PubMed:31527837). Involved in long-term memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity: acts by promoting expression of a hippocampal gene expression network linked to neuroactive receptor signaling (By similarity). Acts as a positive regulator of T-cell activation: upon TCR stimulation, recruited to the IL2 promoter following interaction with NFATC2 and catalyzes acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9ac), leading to promote IL2 expression (By similarity). Required for growth and differentiation of craniofacial cartilage and bone by regulating acetylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9ac) (By similarity). Regulates embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency and differentiation (By similarity). Also acetylates non-histone proteins, such as CEBPB, MRE11, PPARGC1A, PLK4 and TBX5 (PubMed:16753578, PubMed:17301242, PubMed:27796307, PubMed:29174768, PubMed:38128537). Involved in heart and limb development by mediating acetylation of TBX5, acetylation regulating nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of TBX5 (PubMed:29174768). Acts as a negative regulator of centrosome amplification by mediating acetylation of PLK4 (PubMed:27796307). Acts as a negative regulator of gluconeogenesis by mediating acetylation and subsequent inactivation of PPARGC1A (PubMed:16753578, PubMed:23142079). Also acts as a histone glutaryltransferase: catalyzes glutarylation of histone H4 on 'Lys-91' (H4K91glu), a mark that destabilizes nucleosomes by promoting dissociation of the H2A-H2B dimers from nucleosomes (PubMed:31542297).
