EntryName	CASP9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caspase-9 (CASP-9) (EC 3.4.22.62) (Apoptotic protease Mch-6) (Apoptotic protease-activating factor 3) (APAF-3) (ICE-like apoptotic protease 6) (ICE-LAP6) [Cleaved into: Caspase-9 subunit p35; Caspase-9 subunit p10]
GeneName	CASP9 MCH6
Length	416
Function	Involved in the activation cascade of caspases responsible for apoptosis execution. Binding of caspase-9 to Apaf-1 leads to activation of the protease which then cleaves and activates effector caspases caspase-3 (CASP3) or caspase-7 (CASP7). Promotes DNA damage-induced apoptosis in a ABL1/c-Abl-dependent manner. Proteolytically cleaves poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Cleaves BIRC6 following inhibition of BIRC6-caspase binding by DIABLO/SMAC (PubMed:36758105, PubMed:36758106).
