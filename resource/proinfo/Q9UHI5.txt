EntryName	LAT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large neutral amino acids transporter small subunit 2 (L-type amino acid transporter 2) (hLAT2) (Solute carrier family 7 member 8)
GeneName	SLC7A8 LAT2
Length	535
Function	Associates with SLC3A2 to form a functional heterodimeric complex that translocates small and large neutral amino acids with broad specificity and a stoichiometry of 1:1. Functions as amino acid antiporter mediating the influx of extracellular essential amino acids mainly in exchange with the efflux of highly concentrated intracellular amino acids (PubMed:10391915, PubMed:11311135, PubMed:11847106, PubMed:12716892, PubMed:15081149, PubMed:15918515, PubMed:29355479, PubMed:33298890, PubMed:34848541). Has relatively symmetrical selectivities but strongly asymmetrical substrate affinities at both the intracellular and extracellular sides of the transporter (PubMed:11847106). This asymmetry allows SLC7A8 to regulate intracellular amino acid pools (mM concentrations) by exchange with external amino acids (uM concentration range), equilibrating the relative concentrations of different amino acids across the plasma membrane instead of mediating their net uptake (PubMed:10391915, PubMed:11847106). May play an essential role in the reabsorption of neutral amino acids from the epithelial cells to the bloodstream in the kidney (PubMed:12716892). Involved in the uptake of methylmercury (MeHg) when administered as the L-cysteine or D,L-homocysteine complexes, and hence plays a role in metal ion homeostasis and toxicity (PubMed:12117417). Involved in the cellular activity of small molecular weight nitrosothiols, via the stereoselective transport of L-nitrosocysteine (L-CNSO) across the transmembrane (PubMed:15769744). Imports the thyroid hormone diiodothyronine (T2) and to a smaller extent triiodothyronine (T3) but not rT 3 or thyroxine (T4) (By similarity). Mediates the uptake of L-DOPA (By similarity). May participate in auditory function (By similarity).
