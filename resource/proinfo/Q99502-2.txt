EntryName	EYA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein phosphatase EYA1 (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.48) (Eyes absent homolog 1)
GeneName	EYA1
Length	559
Function	Functions both as protein phosphatase and as transcriptional coactivator for SIX1, and probably also for SIX2, SIX4 and SIX5 (By similarity). Tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates 'Tyr-142' of histone H2AX (H2AXY142ph) and promotes efficient DNA repair via the recruitment of DNA repair complexes containing MDC1. 'Tyr-142' phosphorylation of histone H2AX plays a central role in DNA repair and acts as a mark that distinguishes between apoptotic and repair responses to genotoxic stress (PubMed:19234442). Its function as histone phosphatase may contribute to its function in transcription regulation during organogenesis (By similarity). Also has phosphatase activity with proteins phosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues (in vitro) (By similarity). Required for normal embryonic development of the craniofacial and trunk skeleton, kidneys and ears (By similarity). Together with SIX1, it plays an important role in hypaxial muscle development; in this it is functionally redundant with EYA2 (By similarity).
