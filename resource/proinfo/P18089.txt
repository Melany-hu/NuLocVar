EntryName	ADA2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-2B adrenergic receptor (Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor subtype C2) (Alpha-2B adrenoreceptor) (Alpha-2B adrenoceptor) (Alpha-2BAR)
GeneName	ADRA2B ADRA2L1 ADRA2RL1
Length	450
Function	Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors mediate the catecholamine-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase through the action of G proteins. The rank order of potency for agonists of this receptor is clonidine > norepinephrine > epinephrine = oxymetazoline > dopamine > p-tyramine = phenylephrine > serotonin > p-synephrine / p-octopamine. For antagonists, the rank order is yohimbine > chlorpromazine > phentolamine > mianserine > spiperone > prazosin > alprenolol > propanolol > pindolol.
