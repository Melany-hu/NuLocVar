UniprotID	Q6PIV2
Accession	Q6PIV2;B0YJ15;Q08AS8;Q86UT9;Q8IXX2
EntryName	FOXR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Forkhead box protein R1 (Forkhead box protein N5)
GeneName	FOXR1 FOXN5 DLNB13
Length	292
Function	Transcription factor which acts as both an activator and a repressor (PubMed:34723967). Activates transcription of a number of genes including the heat shock chaperones HSPA1A and HSPA6 and the antioxidant NADPH-dependent reductase DHRS2 which are involved in protection against oxidative stress (PubMed:34723967). Required for normal brain development (By similarity).
