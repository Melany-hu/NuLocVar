UniprotID	Q08117
Accession	Q08117;B2RBL0;Q12808;Q14CJ1;Q96TG9;Q9UDY9
EntryName	TLE5_HUMAN
ProteinName	TLE family member 5 (Amino-terminal enhancer of split) (Amino enhancer of split) (Gp130-associated protein GAM) (Grg-5) (Groucho-related protein 5) (Protein ESP1) (Protein GRG) (TLE family member 5, transcriptional modulator)
GeneName	TLE5 AES GRG GRG5
Length	197
Function	Transcriptional corepressor. Acts as a dominant repressor towards other family members. Inhibits NF-kappa-B-regulated gene expression. May be required for the initiation and maintenance of the differentiated state. Essential for the transcriptional repressor activity of SIX3 during retina and lens development.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
