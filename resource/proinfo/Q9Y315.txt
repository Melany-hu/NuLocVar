UniprotID	Q9Y315
Accession	Q9Y315;Q53HN9;Q6PHW2
EntryName	DEOC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase (DERA) (EC 4.1.2.4) (2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate aldolase) (Phosphodeoxyriboaldolase) (Deoxyriboaldolase)
GeneName	DERA CGI-26
Length	318
Function	Catalyzes a reversible aldol reaction between acetaldehyde and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to generate 2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate. Participates in stress granule (SG) assembly. May allow ATP production from extracellular deoxyinosine in conditions of energy deprivation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasmic granule; Nucleus
