UniprotID	Q03013
Accession	Q03013;A8K765;Q05465;Q32NC1;Q4JNT8;Q6FH87
EntryName	GSTM4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutathione S-transferase Mu 4 (EC 2.5.1.18) (GST class-mu 4) (GST-Mu2) (GSTM4-4) (Leukotriene C4 synthase GSTM4) (EC 4.4.1.20)
GeneName	GSTM4
Length	218
Function	Conjugation of reduced glutathione to a wide number of exogenous and endogenous hydrophobic electrophiles (PubMed:8203914, PubMed:8373352). Catalyzes the conjugation of leukotriene A4 with reduced glutathione (GSH) to form leukotriene C4 (PubMed:27791009). Can also catalyze the transfer of a glutathionyl group from glutathione (GSH) to 13(S),14(S)-epoxy-docosahexaenoic acid to form maresin conjugate in tissue regeneration 1 (MCTR1), a bioactive lipid mediator that possess potent anti-inflammatory and proresolving actions (PubMed:27791009).
