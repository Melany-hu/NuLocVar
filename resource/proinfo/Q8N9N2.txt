UniprotID	Q8N9N2
Accession	Q8N9N2;Q5SW06;Q5SW07;Q96EI8;Q9Y307
EntryName	ASCC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Activating signal cointegrator 1 complex subunit 1 (ASC-1 complex subunit p50) (Trip4 complex subunit p50)
GeneName	ASCC1 CGI-18
Length	400
Function	Plays a role in DNA damage repair as component of the ASCC complex (PubMed:29997253). Part of the ASC-1 complex that enhances NF-kappa-B, SRF and AP1 transactivation (PubMed:12077347). In cells responding to gastrin-activated paracrine signals, it is involved in the induction of SERPINB2 expression by gastrin. May also play a role in the development of neuromuscular junction.
