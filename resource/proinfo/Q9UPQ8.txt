UniprotID	Q9UPQ8
Accession	Q9UPQ8;Q5SRE6
EntryName	DOLK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dolichol kinase (EC 2.7.1.108) (Transmembrane protein 15)
GeneName	DOLK KIAA1094 TMEM15 UNQ2422/PRO4980
Length	538
Function	Catalyzes CTP-mediated phosphorylation of dolichol, the terminal step in de novo dolichyl monophosphate (Dol-P) biosynthesis (PubMed:12213788, PubMed:16923818, PubMed:17273964, PubMed:22242004). Dol-P is a lipid carrier essential for the synthesis of N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides and for GPI anchors (PubMed:12213788).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
