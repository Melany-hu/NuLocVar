UniprotID	Q6IAA8
Accession	Q6IAA8;Q8WZ09;Q9NWT0
EntryName	LTOR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ragulator complex protein LAMTOR1 (Late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor and MAPK and MTOR activator 1) (Lipid raft adaptor protein p18) (Protein associated with DRMs and endosomes) (p27Kip1-releasing factor from RhoA) (p27RF-Rho)
GeneName	LAMTOR1 C11orf59 PDRO PP7157
Length	161
Function	Key component of the Ragulator complex, a multiprotein complex involved in amino acid sensing and activation of mTORC1, a signaling complex promoting cell growth in response to growth factors, energy levels, and amino acids (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:22980980, PubMed:29158492). Activated by amino acids through a mechanism involving the lysosomal V-ATPase, the Ragulator plays a dual role for the small GTPases Rag (RagA/RRAGA, RagB/RRAGB, RagC/RRAGC and/or RagD/RRAGD): it (1) acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), activating the small GTPases Rag and (2) mediates recruitment of Rag GTPases to the lysosome membrane (PubMed:22980980, PubMed:28935770, PubMed:29158492, PubMed:30181260, PubMed:31001086, PubMed:32686708, PubMed:36476874). Activated Ragulator and Rag GTPases function as a scaffold recruiting mTORC1 to lysosomes where it is in turn activated (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:22980980, PubMed:29158492). LAMTOR1 is directly responsible for anchoring the Ragulator complex to the lysosomal membrane (PubMed:31001086, PubMed:32686708). LAMTOR1 wraps around the other subunits of the Ragulator complex to hold them in place and interacts with the Rag GTPases, thereby playing a key role in the recruitment of the mTORC1 complex to lysosomes (PubMed:28935770, PubMed:29107538, PubMed:29123114, PubMed:29285400). Also involved in the control of embryonic stem cells differentiation via non-canonical RagC/RRAGC and RagD/RRAGD activation: together with FLCN, it is necessary to recruit and activate RagC/RRAGC and RagD/RRAGD at the lysosomes, and to induce exit of embryonic stem cells from pluripotency via non-canonical, mTOR-independent TFE3 inactivation (By similarity). Also required for late endosomes/lysosomes biogenesis it may regulate both the recycling of receptors through endosomes and the MAPK signaling pathway through recruitment of some of its components to late endosomes (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:22980980). May be involved in cholesterol homeostasis regulating LDL uptake and cholesterol release from late endosomes/lysosomes (PubMed:20544018). May also play a role in RHOA activation (PubMed:19654316).
