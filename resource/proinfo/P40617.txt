UniprotID	P40617
Accession	P40617;A4D119;P80418;Q49AF5
EntryName	ARL4A_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 4A
GeneName	ARL4A ARL4
Length	200
Function	Small GTP-binding protein which cycles between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound form, and the rate of cycling is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAP). GTP-binding protein that does not act as an allosteric activator of the cholera toxin catalytic subunit. Recruits CYTH1, CYTH2, CYTH3 and CYTH4 to the plasma membrane in GDP-bound form.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Nucleolus
