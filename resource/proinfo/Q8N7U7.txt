UniprotID	Q8N7U7
Accession	Q8N7U7;A5D8Y3;B2RPL5
EntryName	TPRX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tetra-peptide repeat homeobox protein 1
GeneName	TPRX1
Length	411
Function	Transcription factor expressed after fertilization required for zygotic genome activation (ZGA), a critical event in early embryonic development during which the developmental control passes from maternally provided mRNAs to the expression of the zygotic genome after fertilization (PubMed:35314832, PubMed:36074823). Binds and activates expression of key ZGA marker genes, such as NANOGNB, ZSCAN4, DUXB, KLF5 and DPPA3 (PubMed:36074823). Binds to regulatory DNA sequences containing a 5'-TAATCC-3' sequence motif (PubMed:36074823).
