UniprotID	Q8IYL9
Accession	Q8IYL9;O75819
EntryName	PSYR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Psychosine receptor (G-protein coupled receptor 65) (T-cell death-associated gene 8 protein)
GeneName	GPR65 TDAG8
Length	337
Function	Receptor for the glycosphingolipid psychosine (PSY) and several related glycosphingolipids (PubMed:11309421). Plays a role in immune response by maintaining lysosome function and supporting phagocytosis-mediated intracellular bacteria clearance (PubMed:27287411). May have a role in activation-induced cell death or differentiation of T-cells (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
