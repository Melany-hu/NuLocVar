EntryName	PCCB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Propionyl-CoA carboxylase beta chain, mitochondrial (PCCase subunit beta) (EC 6.4.1.3) (Propanoyl-CoA:carbon dioxide ligase subunit beta)
GeneName	PCCB
Length	539
Function	This is one of the 2 subunits of the biotin-dependent propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the catabolism of odd chain fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids isoleucine, threonine, methionine, and valine and other metabolites (PubMed:15890657, PubMed:6765947). Propionyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA/propanoyl-CoA to D-methylmalonyl-CoA/(S)-methylmalonyl-CoA (PubMed:15890657, PubMed:6765947). Within the holoenzyme, the alpha subunit catalyzes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of the biotin carried by the biotin carboxyl carrier (BCC) domain, while the beta subunit then transfers the carboxyl group from carboxylated biotin to propionyl-CoA (By similarity). Propionyl-CoA carboxylase also significantly acts on butyryl-CoA/butanoyl-CoA, which is converted to ethylmalonyl-CoA/(2S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA at a much lower rate (PubMed:6765947). Other alternative minor substrates include (2E)-butenoyl-CoA/crotonoyl-CoA (By similarity).
