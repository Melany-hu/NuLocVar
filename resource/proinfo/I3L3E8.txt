UniprotID	I3L3E8
Accession	I3L3E8
EntryName	I3L3E8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 11 (Mediator complex subunit 11)
GeneName	MED11
Length	85
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional pre-initiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
