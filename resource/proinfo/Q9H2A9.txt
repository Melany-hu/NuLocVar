UniprotID	Q9H2A9
Accession	Q9H2A9;Q9H3N2
EntryName	CHST8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 8 (EC 2.8.2.-) (GalNAc-4-O-sulfotransferase 1) (GalNAc-4-ST1) (GalNAc4ST-1) (N-acetylgalactosamine-4-O-sulfotransferase 1)
GeneName	CHST8
Length	424
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of sulfate to position 4 of non-reducing N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues in both N-glycans and O-glycans. Required for biosynthesis of glycoprotein hormones lutropin and thyrotropin, by mediating sulfation of their carbohydrate structures. Only active against terminal GalNAcbeta1,GalNAcbeta. Not active toward chondroitin.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
