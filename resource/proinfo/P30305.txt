EntryName	MPIP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	M-phase inducer phosphatase 2 (EC 3.1.3.48) (Dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25B)
GeneName	CDC25B CDC25HU2
Length	580
Function	Tyrosine protein phosphatase which functions as a dosage-dependent inducer of mitotic progression (PubMed:1836978, PubMed:20360007). Directly dephosphorylates CDK1 and stimulates its kinase activity (PubMed:20360007). Required for G2/M phases of the cell cycle progression and abscission during cytokinesis in a ECT2-dependent manner (PubMed:17332740). The three isoforms seem to have a different level of activity (PubMed:1836978).
