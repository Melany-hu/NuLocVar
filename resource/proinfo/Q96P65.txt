UniprotID	Q96P65
Accession	Q96P65
EntryName	QRFPR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pyroglutamylated RF-amide peptide receptor (AQ27) (G-protein coupled receptor 103) (Orexigenic neuropeptide QRFP receptor) (SP9155)
GeneName	QRFPR GPR103
Length	431
Function	Receptor for the orexigenic neuropeptide QRFP. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins that modulate adenylate cyclase activity and intracellular calcium levels.
