UniprotID	Q9Y5U5
Accession	Q9Y5U5;B1AME1;O95851;Q5U0I4;Q9NYJ9
EntryName	TNR18_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 18 (Activation-inducible TNFR family receptor) (Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein) (CD antigen CD357)
GeneName	TNFRSF18 AITR GITR UNQ319/PRO364
Length	241
Function	Receptor for TNFSF18. Seems to be involved in interactions between activated T-lymphocytes and endothelial cells and in the regulation of T-cell receptor-mediated cell death. Mediated NF-kappa-B activation via the TRAF2/NIK pathway.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted
