UniprotID	Q9C0J9
Accession	Q9C0J9;A2I2N8
EntryName	BHE41_HUMAN
ProteinName	Class E basic helix-loop-helix protein 41 (bHLHe41) (Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 3) (bHLHb3) (Differentially expressed in chondrocytes protein 2) (hDEC2) (Enhancer-of-split and hairy-related protein 1) (SHARP-1)
GeneName	BHLHE41 BHLHB3 DEC2 SHARP1
Length	482
Function	Transcriptional repressor involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm by negatively regulating the activity of the clock genes and clock-controlled genes (PubMed:11278948, PubMed:14672706, PubMed:15193144, PubMed:15560782, PubMed:18411297, PubMed:19786558, PubMed:25083013). Acts as the negative limb of a novel autoregulatory feedback loop (DEC loop) which differs from the one formed by the PER and CRY transcriptional repressors (PER/CRY loop). Both these loops are interlocked as it represses the expression of PER1 and in turn is repressed by PER1/2 and CRY1/2. Represses the activity of the circadian transcriptional activator: CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer by competing for the binding to E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') found within the promoters of its target genes (PubMed:25083013). Negatively regulates its own expression and the expression of DBP and BHLHE41/DEC2. Acts as a corepressor of RXR and the RXR-LXR heterodimers and represses the ligand-induced RXRA/B/G, NR1H3/LXRA, NR1H4 and VDR transactivation activity. Inhibits HNF1A-mediated transactivation of CYP1A2, CYP2E1 AND CYP3A11 (By similarity).
