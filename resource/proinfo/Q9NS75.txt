UniprotID	Q9NS75
Accession	Q9NS75;Q9HCQ2
EntryName	CLTR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CysLTR2) (G-protein coupled receptor GPCR21) (hGPCR21) (G-protein coupled receptor HG57) (HPN321)
GeneName	CYSLTR2 CYSLT2 CYSLT2R PSEC0146
Length	346
Function	Receptor for cysteinyl leukotrienes. The response is mediated via a G-protein that activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. Stimulation by BAY u9773, a partial agonist, induces specific contractions of pulmonary veins and might also have an indirect role in the relaxation of the pulmonary vascular endothelium. The rank order of affinities for the leukotrienes is LTC4 = LTD4 >> LTE4.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
