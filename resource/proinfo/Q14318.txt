Accession	Q14318;C8C9T5;Q53GU3;Q7Z349;Q86YK6
EntryName	FKBP8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP8 (PPIase FKBP8) (EC 5.2.1.8) (38 kDa FK506-binding protein) (38 kDa FKBP) (FKBP-38) (hFKBP38) (FK506-binding protein 8) (FKBP-8) (FKBPR38) (Rotamase)
GeneName	FKBP8 FKBP38
Length	412
Function	Constitutively inactive PPiase, which becomes active when bound to calmodulin and calcium. Seems to act as a chaperone for BCL2, targets it to the mitochondria and modulates its phosphorylation state. The BCL2/FKBP8/calmodulin/calcium complex probably interferes with the binding of BCL2 to its targets. The active form of FKBP8 may therefore play a role in the regulation of apoptosis. Involved in the inhibition of viral infection by influenza A viruses (IAV) (PubMed:28169297).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion; Mitochondrion membrane; Mitochondrion membrane; Mitochondrion membrane
