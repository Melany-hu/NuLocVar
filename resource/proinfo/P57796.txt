UniprotID	P57796
Accession	P57796;Q8N4Z2;Q8WWY5
EntryName	CABP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium-binding protein 4 (CaBP4)
GeneName	CABP4
Length	275
Function	Involved in normal synaptic function through regulation of Ca(2+) influx and neurotransmitter release in photoreceptor synaptic terminals and in auditory transmission. Modulator of CACNA1D and CACNA1F, suppressing the calcium-dependent inactivation and shifting the activation range to more hyperpolarized voltages (By similarity).
