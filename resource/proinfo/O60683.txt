UniprotID	O60683
Accession	O60683;B3KWD8;Q5T095;Q9BW90
EntryName	PEX10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisome biogenesis factor 10 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Peroxin-10) (Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 10) (Peroxisome assembly protein 10) (RING finger protein 69)
GeneName	PEX10 RNF69
Length	326
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase component of a retrotranslocation channel required for peroxisome organization by mediating export of the PEX5 receptor from peroxisomes to the cytosol, thereby promoting PEX5 recycling (PubMed:24662292). The retrotranslocation channel is composed of PEX2, PEX10 and PEX12; each subunit contributing transmembrane segments that coassemble into an open channel that specifically allows the passage of PEX5 through the peroxisomal membrane (By similarity). PEX10 also regulates PEX5 recycling by acting as a E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (PubMed:24662292). When PEX5 recycling is compromised, PEX10 catalyzes polyubiquitination of PEX5 during its passage through the retrotranslocation channel, leading to its degradation (By similarity).
