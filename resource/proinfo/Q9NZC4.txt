UniprotID	Q9NZC4
Accession	Q9NZC4;D3DR08;D3DR10;E9PSB2;Q9H509;Q9UKF9;Q9Y5V4;Q9Y5V5
EntryName	EHF_HUMAN
ProteinName	ETS homologous factor (hEHF) (ETS domain-containing transcription factor) (Epithelium-specific Ets transcription factor 3) (ESE-3)
GeneName	EHF ESE3 ESE3B ESEJ
Length	300
Function	Transcriptional activator that may play a role in regulating epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation. May act as a repressor for a specific subset of ETS/AP-1-responsive genes and as a modulator of the nuclear response to mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades. Binds to DNA sequences containing the consensus nucleotide core sequence GGAA. Involved in regulation of TNFRSF10B/DR5 expression through Ets-binding sequences on the TNFRSF10B/DR5 promoter. May contribute to development and carcinogenesis by acting as a tumor suppressor gene or anti-oncogene.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
