UniprotID	Q9H5K3
Accession	Q9H5K3
EntryName	SG196_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein O-mannose kinase (POMK) (EC 2.7.1.183) (Protein kinase-like protein SgK196) (Sugen kinase 196)
GeneName	POMK SGK196
Length	350
Function	Protein O-mannose kinase that specifically mediates phosphorylation at the 6-position of an O-mannose of the trisaccharide (N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-beta-1,4-mannose) to generate phosphorylated O-mannosyl trisaccharide (N-acetylgalactosamine-beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosamine-beta-1,4-(phosphate-6-)mannose). Phosphorylated O-mannosyl trisaccharide is a carbohydrate structure present in alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1), which is required for binding laminin G-like domain-containing extracellular proteins with high affinity. Only shows kinase activity when the GalNAc-beta-3-GlcNAc-beta-terminus is linked to the 4-position of O-mannose, suggesting that this disaccharide serves as the substrate recognition motif.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
