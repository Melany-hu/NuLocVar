UniprotID	Q13901
Accession	Q13901;A8K336;D6W5F8;Q05D64
EntryName	C1D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear nucleic acid-binding protein C1D (hC1D)
GeneName	C1D
Length	141
Function	Plays a role in the recruitment of the RNA exosome complex to pre-rRNA to mediate the 3'-5' end processing of the 5.8S rRNA; this function may include MPHOSPH6. Can activate PRKDC not only in the presence of linear DNA but also in the presence of supercoiled DNA. Can induce apoptosis in a p53/TP53 dependent manner. May regulate the TRAX/TSN complex formation. Potentiates transcriptional repression by NR1D1 and THRB (By similarity).
