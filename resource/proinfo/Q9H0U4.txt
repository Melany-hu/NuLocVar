UniprotID	Q9H0U4
Accession	Q9H0U4;A8K7S1
EntryName	RAB1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-1B (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB1B
Length	201
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes (PubMed:20545908, PubMed:9437002, PubMed:23236136). Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different set of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (PubMed:9437002). Plays a role in the initial events of the autophagic vacuole development which take place at specialized regions of the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:20545908). Regulates vesicular transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and successive Golgi compartments (By similarity). Required to modulate the compacted morphology of the Golgi (PubMed:26209634). Promotes the recruitment of lipid phosphatase MTMR6 to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Membrane; Preautophagosomal structure membrane; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region
