UniprotID	Q99685
Accession	Q99685;B3KRC2;B7Z9D1;Q6IBG9;Q96AA5
EntryName	MGLL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Monoglyceride lipase (MGL) (EC 3.1.1.23) (HU-K5) (Lysophospholipase homolog) (Lysophospholipase-like) (Monoacylglycerol lipase) (MAGL)
GeneName	MGLL
Length	303
Function	Converts monoacylglycerides to free fatty acids and glycerol (PubMed:19029917, PubMed:20079333, PubMed:21049984, PubMed:22969151, PubMed:24368842). Hydrolyzes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, and thereby contributes to the regulation of endocannabinoid signaling, nociperception and perception of pain (PubMed:19029917, PubMed:20079333, PubMed:21049984, PubMed:22969151, PubMed:24368842). Regulates the levels of fatty acids that serve as signaling molecules and promote cancer cell migration, invasion and tumor growth (PubMed:20079333).
