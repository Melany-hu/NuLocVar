UniprotID	Q8IZJ0
Accession	Q8IZJ0;Q45KQ8;Q6VN55;Q8IWL7
EntryName	IFNL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon lambda-2 (IFN-lambda-2) (Cytokine Zcyto20) (Interleukin-28A) (IL-28A)
GeneName	IFNL2 IL28A ZCYTO20
Length	200
Function	Cytokine with antiviral, antitumour and immunomodulatory activities. Plays a critical role in the antiviral host defense, predominantly in the epithelial tissues. Acts as a ligand for the heterodimeric class II cytokine receptor composed of IL10RB and IFNLR1, and receptor engagement leads to the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway resulting in the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), which mediate the antiviral state. Has a restricted receptor distribution and therefore restricted targets: is primarily active in epithelial cells and this cell type-selective action is because of the epithelial cell-specific expression of its receptor IFNLR1. Seems not to be essential for early virus-activated host defense in vaginal infection, but plays an important role in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced antiviral defense. Plays a significant role in the antiviral immune defense in the intestinal epithelium. Exerts an immunomodulatory effect by up-regulating MHC class I antigen expression.
