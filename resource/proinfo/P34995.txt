UniprotID	P34995
Accession	P34995;Q5U5U4;Q86UH3;Q86VB5;Q8NHB2
EntryName	PE2R1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP1 subtype (PGE receptor EP1 subtype) (PGE2 receptor EP1 subtype) (Prostanoid EP1 receptor)
GeneName	PTGER1
Length	402
Function	Receptor for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The activity of this receptor is mediated by G(q) proteins which activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system. May play a role as an important modulator of renal function. Implicated the smooth muscle contractile response to PGE2 in various tissues.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
