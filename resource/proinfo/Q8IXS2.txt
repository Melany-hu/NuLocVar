EntryName	DRC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynein regulatory complex subunit 2 (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 65) (Testis development protein NYD-SP28)
GeneName	CCDC65 DRC2
Length	484
Function	Component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), a key regulator of ciliary/flagellar motility which maintains the alignment and integrity of the distal axoneme and regulates microtubule sliding in motile axonemes (By similarity). Plays a critical role in the assembly of N-DRC and also stabilizes the assembly of multiple inner dynein arms and radial spokes. Coassembles with DRC1 to form a central scaffold needed for assembly of the N-DRC and its attachment to the outer doublet microtubules (PubMed:24094744).
