Accession	Q8N806;Q86U21;Q86UA9;Q96BY0;Q9NVV6
EntryName	UBR7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Putative E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UBR7 (EC 2.3.2.27) (N-recognin-7) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase UBR7)
GeneName	UBR7 C14orf130
Length	425
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which is a component of the N-end rule pathway. Recognizes and binds to proteins bearing specific N-terminal residues that are destabilizing according to the N-end rule, leading to their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.
