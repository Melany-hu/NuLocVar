UniprotID	Q9Y277
Accession	Q9Y277;Q9UIS0
EntryName	VDAC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Non-selective voltage-gated ion channel VDAC3 (VDAC-3) (hVDAC3) (Outer mitochondrial membrane protein porin 3)
GeneName	VDAC3
Length	283
Function	Non-selective voltage-gated ion channel that mediates the transport of anions and cations through the mitochondrion outer membrane and plasma membrane (PubMed:31935282). Forms a high-conducting channel with a stable open state and a voltage-induced closure with a mild preference for anions over cations (PubMed:31935282). Involved in male fertility and sperm mitochondrial sheath formation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane; Membrane
