Accession	O15488;B7WNN6;O15485;O15486;O15487;O15489;O15490
EntryName	GLYG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycogenin-2 (GN-2) (GN2) (EC 2.4.1.186)
GeneName	GYG2
Length	501
Function	Glycogenin participates in the glycogen biosynthetic process along with glycogen synthase and glycogen branching enzyme. It catalyzes the formation of a short alpha (1,4)-glucosyl chain covalently attached via a glucose 1-O-tyrosyl linkage to internal tyrosine residues and these chains act as primers for the elongation reaction catalyzed by glycogen synthase.
