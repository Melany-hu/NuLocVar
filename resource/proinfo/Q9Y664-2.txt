UniprotID	Q9Y664-2
Accession	Q9Y664;B3KN86;B4DQ76;Q96GT1
EntryName	KPTN_HUMAN
ProteinName	KICSTOR complex protein kaptin (Actin-associated protein 2E4)
GeneName	KPTN
Length	196
Function	As part of the KICSTOR complex functions in the amino acid-sensing branch of the TORC1 signaling pathway. Recruits, in an amino acid-independent manner, the GATOR1 complex to the lysosomal membranes and allows its interaction with GATOR2 and the RAG GTPases. Functions upstream of the RAG GTPases and is required to negatively regulate mTORC1 signaling in absence of amino acids. In absence of the KICSTOR complex mTORC1 is constitutively localized to the lysosome and activated. The KICSTOR complex is also probably involved in the regulation of mTORC1 by glucose.
