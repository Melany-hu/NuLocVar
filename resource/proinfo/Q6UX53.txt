UniprotID	Q6UX53
Accession	Q6UX53;A8K247;Q8WUI1
EntryName	TMT1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thiol S-methyltransferase TMT1B (EC 2.1.1.9) (Methyltransferase-like protein 7B) (Thiol S-methyltransferase METTL7B)
GeneName	TMT1B METTL7B UNQ594/PRO1180
Length	244
Function	Thiol S-methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to alkyl and phenolic thiol-containing acceptor substrates. Together with TMT1B accounts for most of S-thiol methylation activity in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. Selectively methylates S-centered nucleophiles from metabolites such as hydrogen sulfide and dithiothreitol.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Lipid droplet; Microsome; Cytoplasm; Cytosol
