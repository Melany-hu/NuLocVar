UniprotID	Q96CX2
Accession	Q96CX2
EntryName	KCD12_HUMAN
ProteinName	BTB/POZ domain-containing protein KCTD12 (Pfetin) (Predominantly fetal expressed T1 domain)
GeneName	KCTD12 C13orf2 KIAA1778 PFET1
Length	325
Function	Auxiliary subunit of GABA-B receptors that determine the pharmacology and kinetics of the receptor response. Increases agonist potency and markedly alter the G-protein signaling of the receptors by accelerating onset and promoting desensitization (By similarity).
