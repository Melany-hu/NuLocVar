UniprotID	P01037
Accession	P01037;Q96LE6;Q9UCQ6
EntryName	CYTN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cystatin-SN (Cystain-SA-I) (Cystatin-1) (Salivary cystatin-SA-1)
GeneName	CST1
Length	141
Function	Human saliva appears to contain several cysteine proteinase inhibitors that are immunologically related to cystatin S but that differ in their specificity due to amino acid sequence differences. Cystatin SN, with a pI of 7.5, is a much better inhibitor of papain and dipeptidyl peptidase I than is cystatin S, although both inhibit ficin equally well.
