UniprotID	Q9Y5P6
Accession	Q9Y5P6;A8K6N5;Q9H7U3
EntryName	GMPPB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase catalytic subunit beta (EC 2.7.7.13) (GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase B) (GTP-mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase beta)
GeneName	GMPPB
Length	360
Function	Catalytic subunit of the GMPPA-GMPPB mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase complex (PubMed:33986552). Catalyzes the formation of GDP-mannose, an essential precursor of glycan moieties of glycoproteins and glycolipids (PubMed:33986552). Can catalyze the reverse reaction in vitro (PubMed:33986552). Together with GMPPA regulates GDP-alpha-D-mannose levels (PubMed:33986552).
