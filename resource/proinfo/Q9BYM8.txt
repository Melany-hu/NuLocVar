ProteinName	RanBP-type and C3HC4-type zinc finger-containing protein 1 (EC 2.3.2.31) (HBV-associated factor 4) (Heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase 1) (HOIL-1) (Hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 4) (RING finger protein 54) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase HOIL-1) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 7-interacting protein 3)
GeneName	RBCK1 C20orf18 RNF54 UBCE7IP3 XAP3 XAP4
Length	510
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which accepts ubiquitin from specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, such as UBE2L3/UBCM4, and then transfers it to substrates (PubMed:12629548, PubMed:17449468, PubMed:18711448). Functions as an E3 ligase for oxidized IREB2 and both heme and oxygen are necessary for IREB2 ubiquitination (PubMed:12629548). Promotes ubiquitination of TAB2 and IRF3 and their degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:17449468, PubMed:18711448). Component of the LUBAC complex which conjugates linear ('Met-1'-linked) polyubiquitin chains to substrates and plays a key role in NF-kappa-B activation and regulation of inflammation (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:19136968, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). LUBAC conjugates linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and RIPK1 and is involved in activation of the canonical NF-kappa-B and the JNK signaling pathways (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:19136968, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). Linear ubiquitination mediated by the LUBAC complex interferes with TNF-induced cell death and thereby prevents inflammation (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). LUBAC is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) following polyubiquitination of TNF-RSC components by BIRC2 and/or BIRC3 and to conjugate linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and possibly other components contributing to the stability of the complex (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:19136968, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181). The LUBAC complex is also involved in innate immunity by conjugating linear polyubiquitin chains at the surface of bacteria invading the cytosol to form the ubiquitin coat surrounding bacteria (PubMed:28481331). LUBAC is not able to initiate formation of the bacterial ubiquitin coat, and can only promote formation of linear polyubiquitins on pre-existing ubiquitin (PubMed:28481331). The bacterial ubiquitin coat acts as an 'eat-me' signal for xenophagy and promotes NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:28481331). Together with OTULIN, the LUBAC complex regulates the canonical Wnt signaling during angiogenesis (PubMed:23708998). Binds polyubiquitin of different linkage types (PubMed:20005846, PubMed:21455181).
