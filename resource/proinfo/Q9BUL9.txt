UniprotID	Q9BUL9
Accession	Q9BUL9;D3DW70;Q9NX88
EntryName	RPP25_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease P protein subunit p25 (RNase P protein subunit p25)
GeneName	RPP25
Length	199
Function	Component of ribonuclease P, a ribonucleoprotein complex that generates mature tRNA molecules by cleaving their 5'-ends (PubMed:12003489, PubMed:16723659, PubMed:30454648). Also a component of the MRP ribonuclease complex, which cleaves pre-rRNA sequences (PubMed:28115465).
