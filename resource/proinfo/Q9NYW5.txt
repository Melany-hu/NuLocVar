UniprotID	Q9NYW5
Accession	Q9NYW5;Q645W5;Q75MV8
EntryName	TA2R4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 4 (T2R4)
GeneName	TAS2R4
Length	299
Function	Gustducin-coupled receptor for denatonium and N(6)-propyl-2-thiouracil implicated in the perception of bitter compounds in the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal tract. Signals through PLCB2 and the calcium-regulated cation channel TRPM5. In airway epithelial cells, binding of denatonium increases the intracellular calcium ion concentration and stimulates ciliary beat frequency.
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Cell projection; Cilium membrane
