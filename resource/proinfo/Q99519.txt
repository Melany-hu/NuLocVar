UniprotID	Q99519
Accession	Q99519
EntryName	NEUR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sialidase-1 (EC 3.2.1.18) (Acetylneuraminyl hydrolase) (G9 sialidase) (Lysosomal sialidase) (N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminidase 1)
GeneName	NEU1 NANH
Length	415
Function	Catalyzes the removal of sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) moieties from glycoproteins and glycolipids. To be active, it is strictly dependent on its presence in the multienzyme complex. Appears to have a preference for alpha 2-3 and alpha 2-6 sialyl linkage.
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane; Lysosome lumen; Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Lysosome
