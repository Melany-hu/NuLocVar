EntryName	GCM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chorion-specific transcription factor GCMa (hGCMa) (GCM motif protein 1) (Glial cells missing homolog 1)
GeneName	GCM1 GCMA
Length	436
Function	Transcription factor involved in the control of expression of placental growth factor (PGF) and other placenta-specific genes (PubMed:10542267, PubMed:18160678). Binds to the trophoblast-specific element 2 (TSE2) of the aromatase gene enhancer (PubMed:10542267). Binds to the SYDE1 promoter (PubMed:27917469). Has a central role in mediating the differentiation of trophoblast cells along both the villous and extravillous pathways in placental development (PubMed:19219068).
