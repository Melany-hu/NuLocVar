EntryName	RN170_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF170 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Putative LAG1-interacting protein) (RING finger protein 170) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase RNF170)
GeneName	RNF170
Length	258
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays an essential role in stimulus-induced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (ITPR1) ubiquitination and degradation via the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Also involved in ITPR1 turnover in resting cells. Selectively inhibits the TLR3-triggered innate immune response by promoting the 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of TLR3 (PubMed:31076723).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
