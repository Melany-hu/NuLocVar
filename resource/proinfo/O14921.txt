UniprotID	O14921
Accession	O14921;Q6PGR2;Q8TD63;Q9BX45
EntryName	RGS13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 13 (RGS13)
GeneName	RGS13
Length	159
Function	Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form. Binds to both G(i)-alpha and G(q)-alpha (By similarity).
