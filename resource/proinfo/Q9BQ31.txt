UniprotID	Q9BQ31
Accession	Q9BQ31;D6W520;O43651;Q4ZFY1;Q96B56
EntryName	KCNS3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Delayed-rectifier potassium channel regulatory subunit KCNS3 (Delayed-rectifier K(+) channel alpha subunit 3) (Delayed-rectifier potassium channel subunit Kv9.3) (Kv9.3) (Potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily S member 3)
GeneName	KCNS3
Length	491
Function	Potassium channel regulatory subunit that modulates the delayed rectifier potassium channel activity of KCNB1 by namely slowing down the deactivation and inactivation time constants (PubMed:10484328). While it does not form functional channel on its own, it can form functional heterotetrameric channels with KCNB1 (PubMed:10484328).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
