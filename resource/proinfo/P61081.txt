UniprotID	P61081
Accession	P61081;O76069;Q8VC50
EntryName	UBC12_HUMAN
ProteinName	NEDD8-conjugating enzyme Ubc12 (EC 2.3.2.34) (NEDD8 carrier protein) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 M)
GeneName	UBE2M UBC12
Length	183
Function	Accepts the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 from the UBA3-NAE1 E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. The specific interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RBX1, but not RBX2, suggests that the RBX1-UBE2M complex neddylates specific target proteins, such as CUL1, CUL2, CUL3 and CUL4. Involved in cell proliferation.
