UniprotID	Q4V9L6
Accession	Q4V9L6;Q6UXE5;Q8N2F5
EntryName	TM119_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 119 (Osteoblast induction factor) (OBIF)
GeneName	TMEM119 PSEC0199 UNQ731/PRO1415
Length	283
Function	Plays an important role in bone formation and normal bone mineralization. Promotes the differentiation of myoblasts into osteoblasts (PubMed:20025746). May induce the commitment and differentiation of myoblasts into osteoblasts through an enhancement of BMP2 production and interaction with the BMP-RUNX2 pathway. Up-regulates the expression of ATF4, a transcription factor which plays a central role in osteoblast differentiation. Essential for normal spermatogenesis and late testicular differentiation (By similarity).
