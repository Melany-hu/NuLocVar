UniprotID	Q96LA9
Accession	Q96LA9;Q3KNU3;Q3KNU4;Q502W0;Q8TDD6;Q8TDD7
EntryName	MRGX4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor member X4 (Sensory neuron-specific G-protein coupled receptor 5/6)
GeneName	MRGPRX4 MRGX4 SNSR5 SNSR6
Length	322
Function	Orphan receptor. Probably involved in the function of nociceptive neurons. May regulate nociceptor function and/or development, including the sensation or modulation of pain. Potently activated by enkephalins (By similarity).
