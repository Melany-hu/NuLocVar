EntryName	UBE2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 A (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme A) (RAD6 homolog A) (HR6A) (hHR6A) (Ubiquitin carrier protein A) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase A)
GeneName	UBE2A RAD6A
Length	152
Function	E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that accepts ubiquitin from the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 and transfers it to a E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (PubMed:16337599, PubMed:20061386, PubMed:23685073, PubMed:25582440, PubMed:38297121). In vitro catalyzes 'Lys-11', as well as 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:20061386). Together with the E3 enzyme BRE1 (RNF20 and/or RNF40), plays a role in transcription regulation by catalyzing the monoubiquitination of histone H2B at 'Lys-120' to form H2BK120ub1 (PubMed:16337599). H2BK120ub1 gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation, elongation by RNA polymerase II, telomeric silencing, and is also a prerequisite for H3K4me and H3K79me formation (PubMed:16337599). Involved in mitophagy by acting as a E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme for PRKN (PubMed:23685073). In association with the E3 enzyme UBR4, is involved in N-end rule-dependent protein degradation (PubMed:38182926). In association with the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex SIFI, inhibits the mitochondrial stress response by acting as a E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme for UBR4 and KCMF1 (PubMed:38297121).
