EntryName	ACKR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Atypical chemokine receptor 1 (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines) (Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor) (Duffy blood group antigen) (Fy glycoprotein) (GpFy) (Glycoprotein D) (Plasmodium vivax receptor) (CD antigen CD234)
GeneName	ACKR1 DARC FY GPD
Length	336
Function	Atypical chemokine receptor that controls chemokine levels and localization via high-affinity chemokine binding that is uncoupled from classic ligand-driven signal transduction cascades, resulting instead in chemokine sequestration, degradation, or transcytosis. Also known as interceptor (internalizing receptor) or chemokine-scavenging receptor or chemokine decoy receptor. Has a promiscuous chemokine-binding profile, interacting with inflammatory chemokines of both the CXC and the CC subfamilies but not with homeostatic chemokines. Acts as a receptor for chemokines including CCL2, CCL5, CCL7, CCL11, CCL13, CCL14, CCL17, CXCL5, CXCL6, IL8/CXCL8, CXCL11, GRO, RANTES, MCP-1 and TARC. May regulate chemokine bioavailability and, consequently, leukocyte recruitment through two distinct mechanisms: when expressed in endothelial cells, it sustains the abluminal to luminal transcytosis of tissue-derived chemokines and their subsequent presentation to circulating leukocytes; when expressed in erythrocytes, serves as blood reservoir of cognate chemokines but also as a chemokine sink, buffering potential surges in plasma chemokine levels.
