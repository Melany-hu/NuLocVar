EntryName	SMYD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SMYD3 (EC 2.1.1.354) (SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3) (Zinc finger MYND domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	SMYD3 ZMYND1 ZNFN3A1
Length	428
Function	Histone methyltransferase. Specifically methylates 'Lys-4' of histone H3, inducing di- and tri-methylation, but not monomethylation (PubMed:15235609, PubMed:22419068). Also methylates 'Lys-5' of histone H4 (PubMed:22419068). Plays an important role in transcriptional activation as a member of an RNA polymerase complex (PubMed:15235609). Binds DNA containing 5'-CCCTCC-3' or 5'-GAGGGG-3' sequences (PubMed:15235609).
