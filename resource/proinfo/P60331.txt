UniprotID	P60331
Accession	P60331;Q0VAR0;Q0VAR1
EntryName	KR101_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 10-1 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.1) (Keratin-associated protein 10.1) (Keratin-associated protein 18-1) (Keratin-associated protein 18.1)
GeneName	KRTAP10-1 KAP10.1 KAP18-1 KRTAP10.1 KRTAP18-1 KRTAP18.1
Length	282
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
