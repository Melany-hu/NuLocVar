UniprotID	Q9NUP1
Accession	Q9NUP1;Q6NVY6;Q96G84
EntryName	BL1S4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 subunit 4 (BLOC-1 subunit 4) (Protein cappuccino homolog)
GeneName	BLOC1S4 CNO
Length	217
Function	Component of the BLOC-1 complex, a complex that is required for normal biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LRO), such as platelet dense granules and melanosomes. In concert with the AP-3 complex, the BLOC-1 complex is required to target membrane protein cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals. The BLOC-1 complex, in association with SNARE proteins, is also proposed to be involved in neurite extension. Plays a role in intracellular vesicle trafficking.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
