UniprotID	Q9Y463
Accession	Q9Y463;O75258;O75788;O75789
EntryName	DYR1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1B (EC 2.7.12.1) (Minibrain-related kinase) (Mirk protein kinase)
GeneName	DYRK1B MIRK
Length	629
Function	Dual-specificity kinase which possesses both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase activities. Plays an essential role in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) double-strand break repair and rDNA copy number maintenance (PubMed:33469661). During DNA damage, mediates transcription silencing in part via phosphorylating and enforcing DSB accumulation of the histone methyltransferase EHMT2 (PubMed:32611815). Enhances the transcriptional activity of TCF1/HNF1A and FOXO1. Inhibits epithelial cell migration. Mediates colon carcinoma cell survival in mitogen-poor environments. Inhibits the SHH and WNT1 pathways, thereby enhancing adipogenesis. In addition, promotes expression of the gluconeogenic enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 1 (G6PC1).
