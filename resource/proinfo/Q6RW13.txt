UniprotID	Q6RW13
Accession	Q6RW13;A8MVQ5;Q5SNV4;Q5SNV5;Q96AC0;Q96PL4;Q9NRW9
EntryName	ATRAP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Type-1 angiotensin II receptor-associated protein (AT1 receptor-associated protein)
GeneName	AGTRAP ATRAP
Length	159
Function	Appears to be a negative regulator of type-1 angiotensin II receptor-mediated signaling by regulating receptor internalization as well as mechanism of receptor desensitization such as phosphorylation. Also induces a decrease in cell proliferation and angiotensin II-stimulated transcriptional activity.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane
