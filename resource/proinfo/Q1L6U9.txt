UniprotID	Q1L6U9
Accession	Q1L6U9
EntryName	MSMP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostate-associated microseminoprotein (PC3-secreted microprotein)
GeneName	MSMP PSMP
Length	139
Function	Acts as a ligand for C-C chemokine receptor CCR2 (PubMed:24442440). Signals through binding and activation of CCR2 and induces a strong chemotactic response and mobilization of intracellular calcium ions (PubMed:24442440). Exhibits a chemotactic activity for monocytes and lymphocytes but not neutrophils (PubMed:24442440).
