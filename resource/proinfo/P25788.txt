UniprotID	P25788
Accession	P25788;B2RCK6;Q86U83;Q8N1D8;Q9BS70
EntryName	PSA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteasome subunit alpha type-3 (Macropain subunit C8) (Multicatalytic endopeptidase complex subunit C8) (Proteasome component C8) (Proteasome subunit alpha-7) (alpha-7)
GeneName	PSMA3 HC8 PSC8
Length	255
Function	Component of the 20S core proteasome complex involved in the proteolytic degradation of most intracellular proteins. This complex plays numerous essential roles within the cell by associating with different regulatory particles. Associated with two 19S regulatory particles, forms the 26S proteasome and thus participates in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. The 26S proteasome plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins that could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Associated with the PA200 or PA28, the 20S proteasome mediates ubiquitin-independent protein degradation. This type of proteolysis is required in several pathways including spermatogenesis (20S-PA200 complex) or generation of a subset of MHC class I-presented antigenic peptides (20S-PA28 complex). Binds to the C-terminus of CDKN1A and thereby mediates its degradation. Negatively regulates the membrane trafficking of the cell-surface thromboxane A2 receptor (TBXA2R) isoform 2.
