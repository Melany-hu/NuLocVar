EntryName	CLM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	CMRF35-like molecule 1 (CLM-1) (CD300 antigen-like family member F) (Immune receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1) (IREM-1) (Immunoglobulin superfamily member 13) (IgSF13) (NK inhibitory receptor) (CD antigen CD300f)
GeneName	CD300LF CD300F CLM1 IGSF13 IREM1 NKIR UNQ3105/PRO10111
Length	293
Function	Acts as an inhibitory receptor for myeloid cells and mast cells (PubMed:15549731). Positively regulates the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) via phosphatidylserine (PS) recognition; recognizes and binds PS as a ligand which is expressed on the surface of apoptotic cells. Plays an important role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis, by promoting macrophage-mediated efferocytosis and by inhibiting dendritic cell-mediated efferocytosis (By similarity). Negatively regulates Fc epsilon receptor-dependent mast cell activation and allergic responses via binding to ceramide and sphingomyelin which act as ligands (PubMed:24035150). May act as a coreceptor for interleukin 4 (IL-4). Associates with and regulates IL-4 receptor alpha-mediated responses by augmenting IL-4- and IL-13-induced signaling (By similarity). Negatively regulates the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling mediated by MYD88 and TRIF through activation of PTPN6/SHP-1 and PTPN11/SHP-2 (PubMed:22043923). Inhibits osteoclast formation. Induces macrophage cell death upon engagement (By similarity).
