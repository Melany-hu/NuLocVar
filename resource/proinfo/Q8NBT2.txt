UniprotID	Q8NBT2
Accession	Q8NBT2;B4DZZ7;C9JGC4
EntryName	SPC24_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kinetochore protein Spc24 (hSpc24)
GeneName	SPC24 SPBC24
Length	197
Function	Acts as a component of the essential kinetochore-associated NDC80 complex, which is required for chromosome segregation and spindle checkpoint activity (PubMed:14738735). Required for kinetochore integrity and the organization of stable microtubule binding sites in the outer plate of the kinetochore (PubMed:14738735). The NDC80 complex synergistically enhances the affinity of the SKA1 complex for microtubules and may allow the NDC80 complex to track depolymerizing microtubules (PubMed:23085020).
