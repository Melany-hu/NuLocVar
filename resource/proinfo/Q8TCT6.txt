EntryName	SPPL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal peptide peptidase-like 3 (SPP-like 3) (EC 3.4.23.-) (Intramembrane protease 2) (IMP-2) (Presenilin homologous protein 1) (PSH1) (Presenilin-like protein 4)
GeneName	SPPL3 IMP2 PSL4
Length	384
Function	Intramembrane-cleaving aspartic protease (I-CLiP) that cleaves type II membrane protein substrates in or close to their luminal transmembrane domain boundaries (PubMed:16873890, PubMed:25354954, PubMed:25827571). Acts like a sheddase by mediating the proteolytic release and secretion of active site-containing ectodomains of glycan-modifiying glycosidase and glycosyltransferase enzymes such as MGAT5, B4GAT1 and B4GALT1 (PubMed:25354954, PubMed:25827571). Catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of the envelope glycoprotein gp130 and/or the leader peptide gp18LP of the simian foamy virus independent of prior ectodomain shedding by furin or furin-like proprotein convertase (PC)-mediated cleavage proteolysis (PubMed:23132852). May also have the ability to serve as a shedding protease for subsequent intramembrane proteolysis by SPPL2A and SPPL2B of the envelope glycoprotein gp130 (PubMed:23132852). Plays a role in the regulation of cellular glycosylation processes (PubMed:25354954). Required to link T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) and calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascades in lymphocytes by promoting the association of STIM1 and ORAI1 during store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in a protease-independent manner (PubMed:25384971).
