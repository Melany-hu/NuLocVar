EntryName	MFF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial fission factor
GeneName	MFF C2orf33 AD030 AD033 GL004
Length	342
Function	Plays a role in mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission (PubMed:18353969, PubMed:23530241, PubMed:24196833). Promotes the recruitment and association of the fission mediator dynamin-related protein 1 (DNM1L) to the mitochondrial surface (PubMed:23530241). May be involved in regulation of synaptic vesicle membrane dynamics by recruitment of DNM1L to clathrin-containing vesicles (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane; Peroxisome; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle
