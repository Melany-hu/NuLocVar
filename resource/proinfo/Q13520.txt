UniprotID	Q13520
Accession	Q13520
EntryName	AQP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aquaporin-6 (AQP-6) (Aquaporin-2-like) (Kidney-specific aquaporin) (hKID)
GeneName	AQP6 AQP2L
Length	282
Function	Aquaporins form homotetrameric transmembrane channels, with each monomer independently mediating water transport across the plasma membrane along its osmotic gradient (PubMed:8812490). Unlike classical aquaporins, AQP6 is an intracellular channel with selective anion permeability, particularly for nitrate, and exhibits very low water permeability (By similarity). It may also facilitate the transport of gases, such as CO2 and NH4(+), as demonstrated in vitro (By similarity).
