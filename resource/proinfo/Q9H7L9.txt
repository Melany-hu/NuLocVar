UniprotID	Q9H7L9
Accession	Q9H7L9;Q4KMQ5;Q8N6H0;Q9H8D2
EntryName	SDS3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sin3 histone deacetylase corepressor complex component SDS3 (45 kDa Sin3-associated polypeptide) (Suppressor of defective silencing 3 protein homolog)
GeneName	SUDS3 SAP45 SDS3
Length	328
Function	Regulatory protein which represses transcription and augments histone deacetylase activity of HDAC1. May have a potential role in tumor suppressor pathways through regulation of apoptosis. May function in the assembly and/or enzymatic activity of the mSin3A corepressor complex or in mediating interactions between the complex and other regulatory complexes.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
