EntryName	RIOX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosomal oxygenase 2 (60S ribosomal protein L27a histidine hydroxylase) (Bifunctional lysine-specific demethylase and histidyl-hydroxylase MINA) (EC 1.14.11.79) (Histone lysine demethylase MINA) (MYC-induced nuclear antigen) (Mineral dust-induced gene protein) (Nucleolar protein 52) (Ribosomal oxygenase MINA) (ROX)
GeneName	RIOX2 MDIG MINA MINA53 NO52
Length	465
Function	Oxygenase that can act as both a histone lysine demethylase and a ribosomal histidine hydroxylase. Is involved in the demethylation of trimethylated 'Lys-9' on histone H3 (H3K9me3), leading to an increase in ribosomal RNA expression. Also catalyzes the hydroxylation of 60S ribosomal protein L27a on 'His-39'. May play an important role in cell growth and survival. May be involved in ribosome biogenesis, most likely during the assembly process of pre-ribosomal particles.
