UniprotID	Q6P1R4
Accession	Q6P1R4;A6NHV4;Q96AI3
EntryName	DUS1L_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA-dihydrouridine(16/17) synthase [NAD(P)(+)]-like (EC 1.3.1.88) (tRNA-dihydrouridine synthase 1-like)
GeneName	DUS1L DUS1
Length	473
Function	Catalyzes the synthesis of dihydrouridine, a modified base found in the D-loop of most tRNAs (PubMed:34798057, PubMed:39354220). Specifically modifies U16 and U17 in cytoplasmic tRNAs (PubMed:39354220). Affects the level of some mature tRNA and thereby the total cellular translation (PubMed:39354220).
