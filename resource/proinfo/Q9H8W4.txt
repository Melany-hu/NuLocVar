UniprotID	Q9H8W4
Accession	Q9H8W4
EntryName	PKHF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family F member 2 (PH domain-containing family F member 2) (Endoplasmic reticulum-associated apoptosis-involved protein containing PH and FYVE domains) (EAPF) (PH and FYVE domain-containing protein 2) (Phafin-2) (Phafin2) (Zinc finger FYVE domain-containing protein 18)
GeneName	PLEKHF2 ZFYVE18
Length	249
Function	May play a role in early endosome fusion upstream of RAB5, hence regulating receptor trafficking and fluid-phase transport. Enhances cellular sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis (PubMed:18288467).
Subcellular Location	Early endosome membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum
