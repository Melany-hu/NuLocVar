UniprotID	Q9P291
Accession	Q9P291;Q53HK2;Q9H2Q0
EntryName	ARMX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Armadillo repeat-containing X-linked protein 1 (ARM protein lost in epithelial cancers on chromosome X 1) (Protein ALEX1)
GeneName	ARMCX1 ALEX1 AD032
Length	453
Function	Regulates mitochondrial transport during axon regeneration. Increases the proportion of motile mitochondria by recruiting stationary mitochondria into the motile pool. Enhances mitochondria movement and neurite growth in both adult axons and embryonic neurons. Promotes neuronal survival and axon regeneration after nerve injury. May link mitochondria to the Trak1-kinesin motor complex via its interaction with MIRO1.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion; Mitochondrion outer membrane
