UniprotID	Q9UN86
Accession	Q9UN86;A8K6X1;O60606;O75149;Q9UPA1
EntryName	G3BP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 2 (G3BP-2) (GAP SH3 domain-binding protein 2)
GeneName	G3BP2 KIAA0660
Length	482
Function	Scaffold protein that plays an essential role in cytoplasmic stress granule formation which acts as a platform for antiviral signaling (PubMed:23279204, PubMed:32302570, PubMed:32302571, PubMed:32302572). Plays an essential role in stress granule formation (PubMed:27022092, PubMed:32302570, PubMed:32302571, PubMed:32302572, PubMed:35977029). Stress granules are membraneless compartments that store mRNAs and proteins, such as stalled translation pre-initiation complexes, in response to stress (PubMed:32302570, PubMed:32302571, PubMed:32302572). Promotes formation of stress granules phase-separated membraneless compartment by undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon unfolded RNA-binding: functions as a molecular switch that triggers RNA-dependent LLPS in response to a rise in intracellular free RNA concentrations (By similarity).
