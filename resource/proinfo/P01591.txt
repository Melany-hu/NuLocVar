UniprotID	P01591
Accession	P01591
EntryName	IGJ_HUMAN
ProteinName	Immunoglobulin J chain (Joining chain of multimeric IgA and IgM)
GeneName	JCHAIN IGCJ IGJ
Length	159
Function	Serves to link two monomer units of either IgM or IgA. In the case of IgM, the J chain-joined dimer is a nucleating unit for the IgM pentamer, and in the case of IgA it induces dimers and/or larger polymers. It also helps to bind these immunoglobulins to secretory component.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
