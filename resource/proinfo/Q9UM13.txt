EntryName	APC10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 10 (APC10) (Cyclosome subunit 10)
GeneName	ANAPC10 APC10
Length	185
Function	Component of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis and the G1 phase of the cell cycle (PubMed:18485873). The APC/C complex acts by mediating ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins: it mainly mediates the formation of 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitin chains and, to a lower extent, the formation of 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:18485873). The APC/C complex catalyzes assembly of branched 'Lys-11'-/'Lys-48'-linked branched ubiquitin chains on target proteins (PubMed:29033132).
