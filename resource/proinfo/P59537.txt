UniprotID	P59537
Accession	P59537;P59546;Q645X4
EntryName	T2R43_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 43 (T2R43) (Taste receptor type 2 member 52) (T2R52)
GeneName	TAS2R43
Length	309
Function	Gustducin-coupled receptor immplicated in the perception of bitter compounds in the oral cavity and the gastrointestinal tract. Signals through PLCB2 and the calcium-regulated cation channel TRPM5. Activated by the sulfonyl amide sweeteners saccharin and acesulfame K. In airway epithelial cells, binding of bitter compounds increases the intracellular calcium ion concentration and stimulates ciliary beat frequency. May act as chemosensory receptors in airway epithelial cells to detect and eliminate potential noxious agents from the airways (By similarity).
