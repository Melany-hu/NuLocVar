UniprotID	Q6PEY2
Accession	Q6PEY2
EntryName	TBA3E_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tubulin alpha-3E chain (EC 3.6.5.-) (Alpha-tubulin 3E) [Cleaved into: Detyrosinated tubulin alpha-3E chain]
GeneName	TUBA3E
Length	450
Function	Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules, a cylinder consisting of laterally associated linear protofilaments composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers. Microtubules grow by the addition of GTP-tubulin dimers to the microtubule end, where a stabilizing cap forms. Below the cap, tubulin dimers are in GDP-bound state, owing to GTPase activity of alpha-tubulin.
