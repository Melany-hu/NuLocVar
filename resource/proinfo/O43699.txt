UniprotID	O43699
Accession	O43699;A8MV71;B2RTS8;C9JBE5;F8WA78;O15388;O43700
EntryName	SIGL6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 6 (Siglec-6) (CD33 antigen-like 1) (CDw327) (Obesity-binding protein 1) (OB-BP1) (CD antigen CD327)
GeneName	SIGLEC6 CD33L CD33L1 OBBP1
Length	453
Function	Putative adhesion molecule that mediates sialic-acid dependent binding to cells. Binds to alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid. The sialic acid recognition site may be masked by cis interactions with sialic acids on the same cell surface.
