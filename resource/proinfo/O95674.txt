EntryName	CDS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase 2 (EC 2.7.7.41) (CDP-DAG synthase 2) (CDP-DG synthase 2) (CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 2) (CDS 2) (CDP-diglyceride pyrophosphorylase 2) (CDP-diglyceride synthase 2) (CTP:phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase 2)
GeneName	CDS2
Length	445
Function	Catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid (PA) to CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG), an essential intermediate in the synthesis of phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin and phosphatidylinositol (PubMed:25375833). Exhibits specificity for the nature of the acyl chains at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions in the substrate, PA and the preferred acyl chain composition is 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-phosphatidic acid (PubMed:25375833). Plays an important role in regulating the growth and maturation of lipid droplets which are storage organelles at the center of lipid and energy homeostasis (PubMed:26946540, PubMed:31548309).
