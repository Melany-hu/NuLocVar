UniprotID	Q8WXH4
Accession	Q8WXH4;E9PEN1;Q3SYC4;Q7Z667
EntryName	ASB11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 11 (ASB-11)
GeneName	ASB11
Length	323
Function	Substrate-recognition component of a cullin-5-RING E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (ECS complex, also named CRL5 complex), which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, such as BIK, DIRAS2 and RPN1 (PubMed:24337577, PubMed:31387940, PubMed:38574733). The ECS(ASB11) complex acts as a regulator of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of BIK (PubMed:31387940).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum
