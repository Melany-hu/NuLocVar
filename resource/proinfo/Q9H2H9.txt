UniprotID	Q9H2H9
Accession	Q9H2H9;Q8NC61;Q8NCF8;Q96JX2;Q9H2Q2
EntryName	S38A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium-coupled neutral amino acid symporter 1 (Amino acid transporter A1) (N-system amino acid transporter 2) (Solute carrier family 38 member 1) (System A amino acid transporter 1) (System N amino acid transporter 1)
GeneName	SLC38A1 ATA1 NAT2 SAT1 SNAT1
Length	487
Function	Symporter that cotransports short-chain neutral amino acids and sodium ions from the extraccellular to the intracellular side of the cell membrane (PubMed:10891391, PubMed:20599747). The transport is elctrogenic, pH dependent and driven by the Na(+) electrochemical gradient (PubMed:10891391). Participates in the astroglia-derived glutamine transport into GABAergic interneurons for neurotransmitter GABA de novo synthesis (By similarity). May also contributes to amino acid transport in placental trophoblasts (PubMed:20599747). Also regulates synaptic plasticity (PubMed:12388062).
