UniprotID	Q67FW5
Accession	Q67FW5;Q6GV30;Q8WUT3
EntryName	QTGAL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Queuosine-tRNA galactosyltransferase (QTGAL) (EC 2.4.1.-) (Beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 8) (BGnT-8) (Beta-1,3-Gn-T8) (Beta3Gn-T8) (UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-like protein 1) (BGnT-like protein 1) (Beta1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-like protein 1) (Beta3Gn-T-like protein 1) (Beta3GnTL1)
GeneName	B3GNTL1 B3GNT8 QTGAL
Length	346
Function	Glycosyltransferase that specifically catalyzes galactosylation of cytoplasmic tRNA(Tyr) modified with queuosine at position 34 (queuosine(34)) (PubMed:37992713). Galactosylates the cyclopentene hydroxyl group of queuosine(34) in tRNA(Tyr) to form galactosyl-queuosine(34) (PubMed:37992713). Mannosylation of queuosine(34) in tRNA(Tyr) is required to slow-down elongation at cognate codons UAC and suppress stop codon readthrough, thereby regulating protein translation (PubMed:37992713).
