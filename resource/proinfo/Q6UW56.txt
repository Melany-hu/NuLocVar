UniprotID	Q6UW56
Accession	Q6UW56;A8C1S2;A8K779;Q96FF6;Q96RT2;Q9Y2R7;Q9Y5L7
EntryName	ARAID_HUMAN
ProteinName	All-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation factor (Apoptosis-related protein 3) (APR-3) (p18)
GeneName	ATRAID APR3 C2orf28 HSPC013 UNQ214/PRO240
Length	229
Function	Promotes osteoblast cell differentiation and terminal mineralization. Plays a role in inducing the cell cycle arrest via inhibiting CCND1 expression in all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) signal pathway. In osteoclasts, forms a transporter complex with ATRAID for nitrogen-containing-bisphophonates (N-BPs) required for releasing N-BP molecules that have trafficked to lysosomes through fluid-phase endocytosis into the cytosol (PubMed:29745899).
