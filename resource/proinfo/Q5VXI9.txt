UniprotID	Q5VXI9
Accession	Q5VXI9;A7KIH9
EntryName	LIPN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lipase member N (EC 3.1.1.13) (EC 3.1.1.3) (Lipase-like abhydrolase domain-containing protein 4)
GeneName	LIPN LIPL4
Length	398
Function	Plays a highly specific role in the last step of keratinocyte differentiation. Contains two distinct domains: the alpha/beta hydrolase fold and the abhydrolase-associated lipase region, also features the consensus sequence of the active site of a genuine lipase. May have an essential function in lipid metabolism of the most differentiated epidermal layers.
