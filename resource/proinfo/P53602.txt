UniprotID	P53602
Accession	P53602;Q53Y65
EntryName	MVD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.33) (Mevalonate (diphospho)decarboxylase) (MDDase) (Mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase)
GeneName	MVD MPD
Length	400
Function	Catalyzes the ATP dependent decarboxylation of (R)-5-diphosphomevalonate to form isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Functions in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway leading to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), a key precursor for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids and sterol synthesis.
