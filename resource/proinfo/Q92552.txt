UniprotID	Q92552
Accession	Q92552;B4DRT2;Q6P1S1
EntryName	RT27_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein mS27 (28S ribosomal protein S27, mitochondrial) (MRP-S27) (S27mt) (Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S27)
GeneName	MRPS27 KIAA0264
Length	414
Function	RNA-binding component of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mt-SSU) that plays a role in mitochondrial protein synthesis (PubMed:22841715). Stimulates mitochondrial mRNA translation of subunit components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (PubMed:22841715). Binds to the mitochondrial 12S rRNA (12S mt-rRNA) and tRNA(Glu) (PubMed:22841715). Involved also in positive regulation of cell proliferation and tumor cell growth (PubMed:28714366).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Mitochondrion
