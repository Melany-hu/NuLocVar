UniprotID	P01116
Accession	P01116;A8K8Z5;B0LPF9;P01118;Q96D10
EntryName	RASK_HUMAN
ProteinName	GTPase KRas (EC 3.6.5.2) (K-Ras 2) (Ki-Ras) (c-K-ras) (c-Ki-ras) [Cleaved into: GTPase KRas, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	KRAS KRAS2 RASK2
Length	189
Function	Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (PubMed:20949621). Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation (PubMed:22711838, PubMed:23698361). Plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in a ZNF304-dependent manner (PubMed:24623306).
