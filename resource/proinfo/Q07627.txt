UniprotID	Q07627
Accession	Q07627;A6NC32;Q96S60;Q96S67
EntryName	KRA11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 1-1 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 1.1) (Keratin-associated protein 1.1) (Keratin-associated protein 1.6) (Keratin-associated protein 1.7)
GeneName	KRTAP1-1 B2A KAP1.1 KAP1.6 KAP1.7 KRTAP1.1
Length	177
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
