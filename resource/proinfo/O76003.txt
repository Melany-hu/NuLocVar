EntryName	GLRX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutaredoxin-3 (PKC-interacting cousin of thioredoxin) (PICOT) (PKC-theta-interacting protein) (PKCq-interacting protein) (Thioredoxin-like protein 2)
GeneName	GLRX3 PICOT TXNL2 HUSSY-22
Length	335
Function	Together with BOLA2, acts as a cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly factor that facilitates  cluster insertion into a subset of cytosolic proteins (PubMed:26613676, PubMed:27519415). Acts as a critical negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy and a positive inotropic regulator (By similarity). Required for hemoglobin maturation (PubMed:23615448). Does not possess any thyoredoxin activity since it lacks the conserved motif that is essential for catalytic activity.
