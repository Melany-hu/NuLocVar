ProteinName	Nesprin-2 (KASH domain-containing protein 2) (KASH2) (Nuclear envelope spectrin repeat protein 2) (Nucleus and actin connecting element protein) (Protein NUANCE) (Synaptic nuclear envelope protein 2) (Syne-2)
GeneName	SYNE2 KIAA1011 NUA
Length	429
Function	Multi-isomeric modular protein which forms a linking network between organelles and the actin cytoskeleton to maintain the subcellular spatial organization. As a component of the LINC (LInker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex involved in the connection between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton. The nucleocytoplasmic interactions established by the LINC complex play an important role in the transmission of mechanical forces across the nuclear envelope and in nuclear movement and positioning (PubMed:34818527). Specifically, SYNE2 and SUN2 assemble in arrays of transmembrane actin-associated nuclear (TAN) lines which are bound to F-actin cables and couple the nucleus to retrograde actin flow during actin-dependent nuclear movement. May be involved in nucleus-centrosome attachment. During interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) at G2 phase and nuclear migration in neural progenitors its LINC complex association with SUN1/2 and probable association with cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin motor complexes functions to pull the nucleus toward the centrosome; SYNE1 and SYNE2 may act redundantly. During INM at G1 phase mediates respective LINC complex association with kinesin to push the nucleus away from the centrosome. Involved in nuclear migration in retinal photoreceptor progenitors. Required for centrosome migration to the apical cell surface during early ciliogenesis. Facilitates the relaxation of mechanical stress imposed by compressive actin fibers at the rupture site through its nteraction with SYN2 (PubMed:34818527).
