EntryName	NEUR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sialidase-2 (EC 3.2.1.18) (Cytosolic sialidase) (N-acetyl-alpha-neuraminidase 2)
GeneName	NEU2
Length	380
Function	Exo-alpha-sialidase that catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of the terminal sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac) of a glycan moiety in the catabolism of glycolipids, glycoproteins and oligosacharides (PubMed:14613940, PubMed:22228546). Recognizes sialyl linkage positions of the glycan moiety as well as the supramolecular organization of the sialoglycoconjugate. Displays preference for alpha-(2->3)-sialylated GD1a and GT1B gangliosides over alpha-(2->8)-sialylated GD1b, in both monomeric forms and micelles. Hydrolyzes monomeric GM1 ganglioside, but has no activity toward the miscellar form (PubMed:14613940). Has lower sialidase activity for glycoproteins such as fetuin and TF/transferrin that carry a mixture of alpha-(2->3) and alpha-(2->6)-sialyl linkages. Cleaves milk oligosaccharide alpha-(2->3)-sialyllactose, but is inactive toward alpha-(2->6)-sialyllactose isomer. Has no activity toward colominic acid, a homomer of alpha-(2->8)-linked Neu5Ac residues (PubMed:14613940).
