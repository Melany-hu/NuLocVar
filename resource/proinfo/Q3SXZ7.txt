EntryName	TTLL9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable tubulin polyglutamylase TTLL9 (EC 6.3.2.-) (Tubulin--tyrosine ligase-like protein 9)
GeneName	TTLL9 C20orf125
Length	439
Function	Probable tubulin polyglutamylase that generates side chains of glutamate on the gamma-carboxyl group of specific glutamate residues within the C-terminal tail of target proteins. Similar to TTLL1, may acquire enzymatic activity only in complex with other proteins as it is most likely lacking domains important for autonomous activity. Mediates tubulin polyglutamylation which induces establishment of microtubule heterogeneity in sperm flagella, thereby playing a role in normal motile flagella axoneme structure and sperm flagella beating pattern.
