UniprotID	Q15078
Accession	Q15078;E1P664;Q5U0G3
EntryName	CD5R1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activator 1 (CDK5 activator 1) (Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit 1) (TPKII regulatory subunit) [Cleaved into: Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activator 1, p35 (p35); Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activator 1, p25 (p25) (Tau protein kinase II 23 kDa subunit) (p23)]
GeneName	CDK5R1 CDK5R NCK5A
Length	307
Function	p35 is a neuron specific activator of CDK5. The complex p35/CDK5 is required for neurite outgrowth and cortical lamination. Involved in dendritic spine morphogenesis by mediating the EFNA1-EPHA4 signaling. Activator of TPKII. The complex p35/CDK5 participates in the regulation of the circadian clock by modulating the function of CLOCK protein: phosphorylates CLOCK at 'Thr-451' and 'Thr-461' and regulates the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer in association with altered stability and subcellular distribution.
