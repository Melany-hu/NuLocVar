EntryName	TRY1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine protease 1 (EC 3.4.21.4) (Anionic trypsin I) (Anionic trypsin-I) (Beta-trypsin) (Cationic trypsinogen) (Pretrypsinogen I) (Trypsin I) (Trypsin-1) [Cleaved into: Alpha-trypsin chain 1; Alpha-trypsin chain 2]
GeneName	PRSS1 TRP1 TRY1 TRYP1
Length	247
Function	Has activity against the synthetic substrates Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-Mec, Boc-Leu-Thr-Arg-Mec, Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-Mec and Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-Mec. The single-chain form is more active than the two-chain form against all of these substrates.
