UniprotID	P50579
Accession	P50579;B2RDI8;B4DUX5;G3XA91;Q8NB11
EntryName	MAP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MAP 2) (MetAP 2) (EC 3.4.11.18) (Initiation factor 2-associated 67 kDa glycoprotein) (p67) (p67eIF2) (Peptidase M)
GeneName	METAP2 MNPEP P67EIF2
Length	478
Function	Cotranslationally removes the N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins. The N-terminal methionine is often cleaved when the second residue in the primary sequence is small and uncharged (Met-Ala-, Cys, Gly, Pro, Ser, Thr, or Val). The catalytic activity of human METAP2 toward Met-Val peptides is consistently two orders of magnitude higher than that of METAP1, suggesting that it is responsible for processing proteins containing N-terminal Met-Val and Met-Thr sequences in vivo.
