UniprotID	P07951
Accession	P07951;A6NM85;P06468;Q13894;Q53FM4;Q5TCU4;Q5TCU7;Q9UH67
EntryName	TPM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tropomyosin beta chain (Beta-tropomyosin) (Tropomyosin-2)
GeneName	TPM2 TMSB
Length	284
Function	Binds to actin filaments in muscle and non-muscle cells. Plays a central role, in association with the troponin complex, in the calcium dependent regulation of vertebrate striated muscle contraction. Smooth muscle contraction is regulated by interaction with caldesmon. In non-muscle cells is implicated in stabilizing cytoskeleton actin filaments. The non-muscle isoform may have a role in agonist-mediated receptor internalization.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
