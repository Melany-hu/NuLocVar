UniprotID	O75439
Accession	O75439;O60416;Q96FV4
EntryName	MPPB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial-processing peptidase subunit beta (EC 3.4.24.64) (Beta-MPP) (P-52)
GeneName	PMPCB MPPB
Length	489
Function	Catalytic subunit of the essential mitochondrial processing protease (MPP), which cleaves the mitochondrial sequence off newly imported precursors proteins (Probable) (PubMed:29576218). Preferentially, cleaves after an arginine at position P2 (By similarity). Required for PINK1 turnover by coupling PINK1 mitochondrial import and cleavage, which results in subsequent PINK1 proteolysis (PubMed:22354088).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
