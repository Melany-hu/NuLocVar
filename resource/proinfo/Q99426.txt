UniprotID	Q99426
Accession	Q99426;O00111;O00674;O14728;Q6FGY5
EntryName	TBCB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tubulin-folding cofactor B (Cytoskeleton-associated protein 1) (Cytoskeleton-associated protein CKAPI) (Tubulin-specific chaperone B)
GeneName	TBCB CG22 CKAP1
Length	244
Function	Binds to alpha-tubulin folding intermediates after their interaction with cytosolic chaperonin in the pathway leading from newly synthesized tubulin to properly folded heterodimer (PubMed:9265649). Involved in regulation of tubulin heterodimer dissociation. May function as a negative regulator of axonal growth (By similarity).
