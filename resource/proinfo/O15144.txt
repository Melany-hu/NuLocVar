UniprotID	O15144
Accession	O15144;Q92801;Q9P1D4
EntryName	ARPC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 2 (Arp2/3 complex 34 kDa subunit) (p34-ARC)
GeneName	ARPC2 ARC34 PRO2446
Length	300
Function	Actin-binding component of the Arp2/3 complex, a multiprotein complex that mediates actin polymerization upon stimulation by nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) (PubMed:9230079). The Arp2/3 complex mediates the formation of branched actin networks in the cytoplasm, providing the force for cell motility (PubMed:9230079). Seems to contact the mother actin filament (PubMed:9230079). In addition to its role in the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, the Arp2/3 complex also promotes actin polymerization in the nucleus, thereby regulating gene transcription and repair of damaged DNA (PubMed:29925947). The Arp2/3 complex promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair in response to DNA damage by promoting nuclear actin polymerization, leading to drive motility of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (PubMed:29925947).
