UniprotID	Q8IZ02
Accession	Q8IZ02;B4DEJ7;E9PBH2;G5E9T7
EntryName	LRC34_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 34
GeneName	LRRC34
Length	464
Function	Highly expressed in stem cells where it may be involved in regulation of pluripotency. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), important for normal expression of the pluripotency regulators POU5F1/OCT4 and KLF4. Also important for expression of the ectodermal marker gene NES and the endodermal marker gene GATA4. Promotes stem cell proliferation in vitro.
