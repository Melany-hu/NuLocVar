UniprotID	P01213
Accession	P01213;A8K0Q3
EntryName	PDYN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proenkephalin-B (Beta-neoendorphin-dynorphin) (Preprodynorphin) [Cleaved into: Alpha-neoendorphin; Beta-neoendorphin; Big dynorphin (Big Dyn); Dynorphin A(1-17) (Dyn-A17) (Dynorphin A); Dynorphin A(1-13); Dynorphin A(1-8); Leu-enkephalin; Rimorphin (Dynorphin B) (Dyn-B) (Dynorphin B(1-13)); Leumorphin (Dynorphin B-29)]
GeneName	PDYN
Length	254
Function	Leu-enkephalins compete with and mimic the effects of opiate drugs. They play a role in a number of physiologic functions, including pain perception and responses to stress (By similarity).
