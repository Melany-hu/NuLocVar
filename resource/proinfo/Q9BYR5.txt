UniprotID	Q9BYR5
Accession	Q9BYR5;A0JP64
EntryName	KRA42_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 4-2 (Keratin-associated protein 4.2) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 4.2)
GeneName	KRTAP4-2 KAP4.2 KRTAP4.2
Length	136
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
