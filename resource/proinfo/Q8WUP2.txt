UniprotID	Q8WUP2
Accession	Q8WUP2;B3KNY0;Q5VVE0;Q5VVE1;Q8IX23;Q96T00;Q9UFD6
EntryName	FBLI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Filamin-binding LIM protein 1 (FBLP-1) (Migfilin) (Mitogen-inducible 2-interacting protein) (MIG2-interacting protein)
GeneName	FBLIM1 FBLP1
Length	373
Function	Serves as an anchoring site for cell-ECM adhesion proteins and filamin-containing actin filaments. Is implicated in cell shape modulation (spreading) and motility. May participate in the regulation of filamin-mediated cross-linking and stabilization of actin filaments. May also regulate the assembly of filamin-containing signaling complexes that control actin assembly. Promotes dissociation of FLNA from ITGB3 and ITGB7. Promotes activation of integrins and regulates integrin-mediated cell-cell adhesion.
Subcellular Location	Cell junction; Focal adhesion; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Stress fiber
