UniprotID	Q8WXU2
Accession	Q8WXU2;Q6P5Y9;Q8N1S6
EntryName	DAAF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynein axonemal assembly factor 4 (Dyslexia susceptibility 1 candidate gene 1 protein)
GeneName	DNAAF4 DYX1C1 EKN1
Length	420
Function	Axonemal dynein assembly factor required for ciliary motility. Involved in neuronal migration during development of the cerebral neocortex. May regulate the stability and proteasomal degradation of the estrogen receptors that play an important role in neuronal differentiation, survival and plasticity.
