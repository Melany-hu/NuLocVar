UniprotID	Q00526
Accession	Q00526
EntryName	CDK3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-dependent kinase 3 (EC 2.7.11.22) (Cell division protein kinase 3)
GeneName	CDK3 CDKN3
Length	305
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a critical role in the control of the eukaryotic cell cycle; involved in G0-G1 and G1-S cell cycle transitions. Interacts with CCNC/cyclin-C during interphase. Phosphorylates histone H1, ATF1, RB1 and CABLES1. ATF1 phosphorylation triggers ATF1 transactivation and transcriptional activities, and promotes cell proliferation and transformation. CDK3/cyclin-C mediated RB1 phosphorylation is required for G0-G1 transition. Promotes G1-S transition probably by contributing to the activation of E2F1, E2F2 and E2F3 in a RB1-independent manner.
