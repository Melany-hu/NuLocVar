Length	146
Function	Cytokine that plays important roles in allergic inflammation and immune response to parasite infection (PubMed:8096327, PubMed:8097324). Synergizes with IL2 in regulating interferon-gamma synthesis (PubMed:8096327). Stimulates B-cell proliferation, and activation of eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells (PubMed:7903680, PubMed:8759755). Plays an important role in controlling IL33 activity by modulating the production of transmembrane and soluble forms of interleukin-1 receptor-like 1/IL1RL1 (By similarity). Displays the capacity to antagonize Th1-driven proinflammatory immune response and downregulates synthesis of many proinflammatory cytokines including IL1, IL6, IL10, IL12 and TNF-alpha through a mechanism that partially involves suppression of NF-kappa-B (By similarity). Also functions on nonhematopoietic cells, including endothelial cells where it induces vascular cell adhesion protein 1/VCAM1, which is important in the recruitment of eosinophils (PubMed:8639787). Exerts its biological effects through its receptors which comprises the IL4R chain and the IL13RA1 chain, to activate JAK1 and TYK2, leading to the activation of STAT6 (PubMed:9013879). Aside from IL13RA1, another receptor IL13RA2 acts as a high affinity decoy for IL13 and mediates internalization and depletion of extracellular IL13 (PubMed:21622864).
