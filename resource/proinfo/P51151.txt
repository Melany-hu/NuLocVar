UniprotID	P51151
Accession	P51151;A8K390;Q6ICN1
EntryName	RAB9A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-9A (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB9A RAB9
Length	201
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (By similarity). RAB9A is involved in the transport of proteins between the endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (PubMed:34793709). Specifically uses NDE1/NDEL1 as an effector to interact with the dynein motor complex in order to control retrograde trafficking of RAB9-associated late endosomes to the TGN (PubMed:34793709). Involved in the recruitment of SGSM2 to melanosomes and is required for the proper trafficking of melanogenic enzymes TYR, TYRP1 and DCT/TYRP2 to melanosomes in melanocytes (By similarity).
