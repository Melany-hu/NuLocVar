UniprotID	P14174
Accession	P14174;A5Z1R8;B2R4S3;Q2V4Y5;Q6FHV0
EntryName	MIF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (EC 5.3.2.1) (Glycosylation-inhibiting factor) (GIF) (L-dopachrome isomerase) (L-dopachrome tautomerase) (EC 5.3.3.12) (Phenylpyruvate tautomerase)
GeneName	MIF GLIF MMIF
Length	115
Function	Pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens (PubMed:15908412, PubMed:17443469, PubMed:23776208). The expression of MIF at sites of inflammation suggests a role as mediator in regulating the function of macrophages in host defense (PubMed:15908412, PubMed:17443469, PubMed:23776208). Counteracts the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids (PubMed:15908412, PubMed:17443469, PubMed:23776208). Has phenylpyruvate tautomerase and dopachrome tautomerase activity (in vitro), but the physiological substrate is not known (PubMed:11439086, PubMed:17526494). It is not clear whether the tautomerase activity has any physiological relevance, and whether it is important for cytokine activity (PubMed:11439086, PubMed:17526494).
