UniprotID	P49019
Accession	P49019;A8K4G5;B2R830;E9PI97;Q8NGE4
EntryName	HCAR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3 (G-protein coupled receptor 109B) (G-protein coupled receptor HM74) (G-protein coupled receptor HM74B) (Niacin receptor 2) (Nicotinic acid receptor 2)
GeneName	HCAR3 GPR109B HCA3 HM74B NIACR2
Length	387
Function	Receptor for 3-OH-octanoid acid mediates a negative feedback regulation of adipocyte lipolysis to counteract prolipolytic influences under conditions of physiological or pathological increases in beta-oxidation rates. Acts as a low affinity receptor for nicotinic acid. This pharmacological effect requires nicotinic acid doses that are much higher than those provided by a normal diet.
