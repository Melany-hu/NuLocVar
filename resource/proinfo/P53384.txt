EntryName	NUBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly factor NUBP1 (Nucleotide-binding protein 1) (NBP 1)
GeneName	NUBP1 NBP NBP1
Length	320
Function	Component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe/S) protein assembly (CIA) machinery (PubMed:18573874). Required for maturation of extramitochondrial Fe-S proteins (PubMed:18573874). The NUBP1-NUBP2 heterotetramer forms a Fe-S scaffold complex, mediating the de novo assembly of an Fe-S cluster and its transfer to target apoproteins (PubMed:18573874). Implicated in the regulation of centrosome duplication (By similarity). Negatively regulates cilium formation and structure (By similarity).
