UniprotID	Q96C74
Accession	Q96C74;D3DTC9;Q9BZX0
EntryName	ROP1L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ropporin-1-like protein (ROPN1-like protein) (AKAP-associated sperm protein)
GeneName	ROPN1L ASP RSPH11
Length	230
Function	Functions as part of axonemal radial spoke complexes that play an important part in the motility of sperm and cilia. Important for male fertility. With ROPN1, involved in fibrous sheath integrity and sperm motility, plays a role in PKA-dependent signaling processes required for spermatozoa capacitation.
