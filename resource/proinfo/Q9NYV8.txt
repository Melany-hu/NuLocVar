EntryName	T2R14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 14 (T2R14) (Taste receptor family B member 1) (TRB1)
GeneName	TAS2R14
Length	317
Function	Gustducin-linked G-protein coupled receptor that plays a role in the perception of bitterness (PubMed:38600377, PubMed:38776963). The activity of this receptor stimulates GNAT3, activating the gustducin G-protein pathway (PubMed:38600377, PubMed:38776963). Likely plays a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content and other extra-oral tissues via the inhibitory G-protein pathways (PubMed:38600377, PubMed:38776963).
