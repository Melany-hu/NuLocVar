UniprotID	Q86V86
Accession	Q86V86;A5D8X8;A8K7J0;B1B0P0;Q68BM2
EntryName	PIM3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase pim-3 (EC 2.7.11.1)
GeneName	PIM3
Length	326
Function	Proto-oncogene with serine/threonine kinase activity that can prevent apoptosis, promote cell survival and protein translation. May contribute to tumorigenesis through: the delivery of survival signaling through phosphorylation of BAD which induces release of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X(L), the regulation of cell cycle progression, protein synthesis and by regulation of MYC transcriptional activity. Additionally to this role on tumorigenesis, can also negatively regulate insulin secretion by inhibiting the activation of MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2), through SOCS6. Involved also in the control of energy metabolism and regulation of AMPK activity in modulating MYC and PPARGC1A protein levels and cell growth.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
