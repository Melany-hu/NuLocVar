UniprotID	Q8TCE6
Accession	Q8TCE6;B1AMV6;B4DDC3;D3DRC8;Q9NXW4
EntryName	DEN10_HUMAN
ProteinName	DENN domain-containing protein 10 (Protein FAM45A)
GeneName	DENND10 FAM45A
Length	357
Function	Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) regulating homeostasis of late endocytic pathway, including endosomal positioning, maturation and secretion, possibly through activating Rab proteins such as RAB27A and RAB27B. Seems to promote the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting inactive GDP-bound RAB27A and RAB27B into their active GTP-bound form.
Subcellular Location	Late endosome
