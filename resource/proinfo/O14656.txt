UniprotID	O14656
Accession	O14656;B2RB58;Q53Y64;Q96CA0
EntryName	TOR1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Torsin-1A (Dystonia 1 protein) (Torsin ATPase-1A) (EC 3.6.4.-) (Torsin family 1 member A)
GeneName	TOR1A DQ2 DYT1 TA TORA
Length	332
Function	Protein with chaperone functions important for the control of protein folding, processing, stability and localization as well as for the reduction of misfolded protein aggregates. Involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle recycling, controls STON2 protein stability in collaboration with the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN). In the nucleus, may link the cytoskeleton with the nuclear envelope, this mechanism seems to be crucial for the control of nuclear polarity, cell movement and, specifically in neurons, nuclear envelope integrity. Participates in the cellular trafficking and may regulate the subcellular location of multipass membrane proteins such as the dopamine transporter SLC6A3, leading to the modulation of dopamine neurotransmission. In the endoplasmic reticulum, plays a role in the quality control of protein folding by increasing clearance of misfolded proteins such as SGCE variants or holding them in an intermediate state for proper refolding. May have a redundant function with TOR1B in non-neural tissues.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum lumen; Nucleus membrane; Cell projection; Growth cone; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
