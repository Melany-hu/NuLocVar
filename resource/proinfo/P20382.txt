UniprotID	P20382
Accession	P20382;Q16044;Q8WVG0
EntryName	MCH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pro-MCH [Cleaved into: Neuropeptide-glycine-glutamic acid (NGE) (Neuropeptide G-E); Neuropeptide-glutamic acid-isoleucine (NEI) (Neuropeptide E-I); Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)]
GeneName	PMCH MCH
Length	165
Function	MCH may act as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in a broad array of neuronal functions directed toward the regulation of goal-directed behavior, such as food intake, and general arousal. May also have a role in spermatocyte differentiation.
