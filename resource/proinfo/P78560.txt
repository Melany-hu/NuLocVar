UniprotID	P78560
Accession	P78560;B7Z2Q5
EntryName	CRADD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Death domain-containing protein CRADD (Caspase and RIP adapter with death domain) (RIP-associated protein with a death domain)
GeneName	CRADD RAIDD
Length	199
Function	Adapter protein that associates with PIDD1 and the caspase CASP2 to form the PIDDosome, a complex that activates CASP2 and triggers apoptosis (PubMed:15073321, PubMed:16652156, PubMed:17159900, PubMed:17289572, PubMed:9044836). Also recruits CASP2 to the TNFR-1 signaling complex through its interaction with RIPK1 and TRADD and may play a role in the tumor necrosis factor-mediated signaling pathway (PubMed:8985253).
