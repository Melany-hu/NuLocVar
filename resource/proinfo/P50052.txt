EntryName	AGTR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Type-2 angiotensin II receptor (Angiotensin II type-2 receptor) (AT2 receptor)
GeneName	AGTR2
Length	363
Function	Receptor for angiotensin II, a vasoconstricting peptide (PubMed:28379944, PubMed:29967536, PubMed:31899086, PubMed:8185599). Signals primarily via a non-canonical G-protein- and beta-arrestin independent pathways (PubMed:28379944). Cooperates with MTUS1 to inhibit ERK2 activation and cell proliferation (PubMed:15123706).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
