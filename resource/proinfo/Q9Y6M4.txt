UniprotID	Q9Y6M4
Accession	Q9Y6M4;A8K040;B4DSH2;B7Z9Q4;E7EVD0;Q86WZ7;Q9Y6M3
EntryName	KC1G3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Casein kinase I isoform gamma-3 (CKI-gamma 3) (EC 2.7.11.1)
GeneName	CSNK1G3
Length	447
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase. Casein kinases are operationally defined by their preferential utilization of acidic proteins such as caseins as substrates. It can phosphorylate a large number of proteins. Participates in Wnt signaling. Regulates fast synaptic transmission mediated by glutamate (By similarity).
