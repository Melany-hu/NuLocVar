UniprotID	P17568
Accession	P17568;Q6ICN9;Q9UI16
EntryName	NDUB7_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 7 (Cell adhesion protein SQM1) (Complex I-B18) (CI-B18) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B18 subunit)
GeneName	NDUFB7
Length	137
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Mitochondrion intermembrane space
