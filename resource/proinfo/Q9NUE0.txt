UniprotID	Q9NUE0
Accession	Q9NUE0;A6NHY9;B4DQ84;Q5JYH0;Q9H020
EntryName	ZDH18_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC18 (EC 2.3.1.225) (DHHC domain-containing cysteine-rich protein 18) (DHHC-18) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 18)
GeneName	ZDHHC18
Length	388
Function	Palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of palmitate onto various protein substrates, such as CGAS, HRAS and LCK (PubMed:23034182, PubMed:27481942, PubMed:35438208). Acts as a negative regulator of the cGAS-STING pathway be mediating palmitoylation and inactivation of CGAS (PubMed:35438208). May also have a palmitoyltransferase activity toward the beta-2 adrenergic receptor/ADRB2 and therefore regulate G protein-coupled receptor signaling (PubMed:27481942).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
