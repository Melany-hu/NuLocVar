EntryName	Z385A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein 385A (Hematopoietic zinc finger protein) (Retinal zinc finger protein)
GeneName	ZNF385A HZF RZF ZNF385
Length	386
Function	RNA-binding protein that affects the localization and the translation of a subset of mRNA. May play a role in adipogenesis through binding to the 3'-UTR of CEBPA mRNA and regulation of its translation. Targets ITPR1 mRNA to dendrites in Purkinje cells, and may regulate its activity-dependent translation. With ELAVL1, binds the 3'-UTR of p53/TP53 mRNAs to control their nuclear export induced by CDKN2A. Hence, may regulate p53/TP53 expression and mediate in part the CDKN2A anti-proliferative activity. May also bind CCNB1 mRNA. Alternatively, may also regulate p53/TP53 activity through direct protein-protein interaction. Interacts with p53/TP53 and promotes cell-cycle arrest over apoptosis enhancing preferentially the DNA binding and transactivation of p53/TP53 on cell-cycle arrest target genes over proapoptotic target genes. May also regulate the ubiquitination and stability of CDKN1A promoting DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest. Also plays a role in megakaryocytes differentiation.
