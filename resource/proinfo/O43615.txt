UniprotID	O43615
Accession	O43615;A8K0R9;D6W664;Q8N193
EntryName	TIM44_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit TIM44
GeneName	TIMM44 MIMT44 TIM44
Length	452
Function	Essential component of the PAM complex, a complex required for the translocation of transit peptide-containing proteins from the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix in an ATP-dependent manner (By similarity). Recruits mitochondrial HSP70 to drive protein translocation into the matrix using ATP as an energy source (By similarity).
