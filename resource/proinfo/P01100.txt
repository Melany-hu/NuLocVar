UniprotID	P01100
Accession	P01100;A8K4E2;B4DQ65;P18849
EntryName	FOS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein c-Fos (Cellular oncogene fos) (Fos proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit) (G0/G1 switch regulatory protein 7) (Proto-oncogene c-Fos) (Transcription factor AP-1 subunit c-Fos)
GeneName	FOS G0S7
Length	380
Function	Nuclear phosphoprotein which forms a tight but non-covalently linked complex with the JUN/AP-1 transcription factor. In the heterodimer, FOS and JUN/AP-1 basic regions each seems to interact with symmetrical DNA half sites. On TGF-beta activation, forms a multimeric SMAD3/SMAD4/JUN/FOS complex at the AP1/SMAD-binding site to regulate TGF-beta-mediated signaling. Has a critical function in regulating the development of cells destined to form and maintain the skeleton. It is thought to have an important role in signal transduction, cell proliferation and differentiation. In growing cells, activates phospholipid synthesis, possibly by activating CDS1 and PI4K2A. This activity requires Tyr-dephosphorylation and association with the endoplasmic reticulum.
