EntryName	MAVS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) (CARD adapter inducing interferon beta) (Cardif) (Interferon beta promoter stimulator protein 1) (IPS-1) (Putative NF-kappa-B-activating protein 031N) (Virus-induced-signaling adapter) (VISA)
GeneName	MAVS IPS1 KIAA1271 VISA
Length	540
Function	Adapter required for innate immune defense against viruses (PubMed:16125763, PubMed:16127453, PubMed:16153868, PubMed:16177806, PubMed:19631370, PubMed:20127681, PubMed:20451243, PubMed:21170385, PubMed:23087404, PubMed:27992402, PubMed:33139700, PubMed:37582970). Acts downstream of DHX33, RIGI and IFIH1/MDA5, which detect intracellular dsRNA produced during viral replication, to coordinate pathways leading to the activation of NF-kappa-B, IRF3 and IRF7, and to the subsequent induction of antiviral cytokines such as IFNB and RANTES (CCL5) (PubMed:16125763, PubMed:16127453, PubMed:16153868, PubMed:16177806, PubMed:19631370, PubMed:20127681, PubMed:20451243, PubMed:20628368, PubMed:21170385, PubMed:23087404, PubMed:25636800, PubMed:27736772, PubMed:33110251). Peroxisomal and mitochondrial MAVS act sequentially to create an antiviral cellular state (PubMed:20451243). Upon viral infection, peroxisomal MAVS induces the rapid interferon-independent expression of defense factors that provide short-term protection, whereas mitochondrial MAVS activates an interferon-dependent signaling pathway with delayed kinetics, which amplifies and stabilizes the antiviral response (PubMed:20451243). May activate the same pathways following detection of extracellular dsRNA by TLR3 (PubMed:16153868). May protect cells from apoptosis (PubMed:16125763). Involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation by mediating NLRP3 recruitment to mitochondria (PubMed:23582325).
