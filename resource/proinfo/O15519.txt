EntryName	CFLAR_HUMAN
ProteinName	CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (Caspase homolog) (CASH) (Caspase-eight-related protein) (Casper) (Caspase-like apoptosis regulatory protein) (CLARP) (Cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein) (c-FLIP) (FADD-like antiapoptotic molecule 1) (FLAME-1) (Inhibitor of FLICE) (I-FLICE) (MACH-related inducer of toxicity) (MRIT) (Usurpin) [Cleaved into: CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator subunit p43; CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator subunit p12]
GeneName	CFLAR CASH CASP8AP1 CLARP MRIT
Length	480
Function	Apoptosis regulator protein which may function as a crucial link between cell survival and cell death pathways in mammalian cells. Acts as an inhibitor of TNFRSF6 mediated apoptosis. A proteolytic fragment (p43) is likely retained in the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) thereby blocking further recruitment and processing of caspase-8 at the complex. Full length and shorter isoforms have been shown either to induce apoptosis or to reduce TNFRSF-triggered apoptosis. Lacks enzymatic (caspase) activity.
