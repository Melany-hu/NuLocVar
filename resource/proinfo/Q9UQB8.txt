EntryName	BAIP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	BAR/IMD domain-containing adapter protein 2 (Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2) (BAI-associated protein 2) (BAI1-associated protein 2) (Protein BAP2) (Fas ligand-associated factor 3) (FLAF3) (Insulin receptor substrate p53/p58) (IRS-58) (IRSp53/58) (Insulin receptor substrate protein of 53 kDa) (IRSp53) (Insulin receptor substrate p53)
GeneName	BAIAP2
Length	552
Function	Adapter protein that links membrane-bound small G-proteins to cytoplasmic effector proteins. Necessary for CDC42-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and for RAC1-mediated membrane ruffling. Involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by WASF family members and the Arp2/3 complex. Plays a role in neurite growth. Acts syngeristically with ENAH to promote filipodia formation. Plays a role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to bacterial infection. Participates in actin bundling when associated with EPS8, promoting filopodial protrusions.
