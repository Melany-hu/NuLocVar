UniprotID	Q9Y3L5
Accession	Q9Y3L5;B3KWD6;Q5H9H9;Q9BTS0
EntryName	RAP2C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rap-2c (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAP2C
Length	183
Function	Small GTP-binding protein which cycles between a GDP-bound inactive and a GTP-bound active form. May play a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements and regulate cell spreading through activation of the effector TNIK. May play a role in SRE-mediated gene transcription.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Recycling endosome membrane
