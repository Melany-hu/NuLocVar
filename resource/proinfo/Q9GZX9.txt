UniprotID	Q9GZX9
Accession	Q9GZX9;B2RE08;D3DUH9;Q8NBI7;Q96K46
EntryName	TWSG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Twisted gastrulation protein homolog 1
GeneName	TWSG1 TSG PSEC0250
Length	223
Function	May be involved in dorsoventral axis formation. Seems to antagonize BMP signaling by forming ternary complexes with CHRD and BMPs, thereby preventing BMPs from binding to their receptors. In addition to the anti-BMP function, also has pro-BMP activity, partly mediated by cleavage and degradation of CHRD, which releases BMPs from ternary complexes. May be an important modulator of BMP-regulated cartilage development and chondrocyte differentiation. May play a role in thymocyte development (By similarity).
