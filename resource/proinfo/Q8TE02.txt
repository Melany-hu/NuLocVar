EntryName	ELP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Elongator complex protein 5 (Dermal papilla-derived protein 6) (S-phase 2 protein)
GeneName	ELP5 C17orf81 DERP6 HSPC002 MSTP071
Length	300
Function	Component of the elongator complex which is required for multiple tRNA modifications, including mcm5U (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl uridine), mcm5s2U (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine), and ncm5U (5-carbamoylmethyl uridine) (PubMed:29332244). The elongator complex catalyzes formation of carboxymethyluridine in the wobble base at position 34 in tRNAs (PubMed:29332244). Involved in cell migration (By similarity).
