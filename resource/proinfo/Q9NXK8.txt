UniprotID	Q9NXK8
Accession	Q9NXK8;B3KSJ8;Q9H5K4
EntryName	FXL12_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-box/LRR-repeat protein 12 (F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 12) (F-box protein FBL12)
GeneName	FBXL12 FBL12
Length	326
Function	Substrate-recognition component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Mediates the polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CAMK1 leading to disruption of cyclin D1/CDK4 complex assembly which results in G1 cell cycle arrest in lung epithelia.
