UniprotID	Q92185
Accession	Q92185;A8K4H6;Q17RL0;Q6PZN5;Q93064
EntryName	SIA8A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-N-acetylneuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.3.8) (Alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 8A) (Ganglioside GD3 synthase) (Ganglioside GT3 synthase) (Sialyltransferase 8A) (SIAT8-A) (Sialyltransferase St8Sia I) (ST8SiaI)
GeneName	ST8SIA1 SIAT8 SIAT8A
Length	356
Function	Catalyzes the addition of sialic acid in alpha 2,8-linkage to the sialic acid moiety of the ganglioside GM3 to form ganglioside GD3; gangliosides are a subfamily of complex glycosphingolipds that contain one or more residues of sialic acid (PubMed:18348864, PubMed:22885356, PubMed:7937974, PubMed:8058740, PubMed:8195250, PubMed:8631981, PubMed:8706663). Can catalyze the addition of a second alpha-2,8-sialic acid to GD3 to form GT3 (PubMed:8631981). Can use GM1b, GD1a and GT1b as acceptor substrates to synthesize GD1c, GT1a and GQ1b respectively (PubMed:8706663). Can synthesize unusual tetra- and pentasialylated lactosylceramide derivatives identified as GQ3 (II3Neu5Ac4-Gg2Cer) and GP3 (II3Neu5Ac5-Gg2Cer) in breast cancer cells (PubMed:22885356).
