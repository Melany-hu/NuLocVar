UniprotID	Q19T08
Accession	Q19T08;B4E3H7;C3RSF2
EntryName	ECSCR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endothelial cell-specific chemotaxis regulator (Apoptosis regulator through modulating IAP expression) (ARIA) (Endothelial cell-specific molecule 2)
GeneName	ECSCR ECSM2
Length	205
Function	Regulates endothelial chemotaxis and tube formation. Has a role in angiogenesis and apoptosis via modulation of the actin cytoskeleton and facilitation of proteasomal degradation of the apoptosis inhibitors BIRC3/IAP1 and BIRC2/IAP2.
