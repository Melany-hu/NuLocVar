UniprotID	P49411
Accession	P49411;O15276
EntryName	EFTU_HUMAN
ProteinName	Elongation factor Tu, mitochondrial (EF-Tu) (EC 3.6.5.3) (P43)
GeneName	TUFM
Length	455
Function	GTP hydrolase that promotes the GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of ribosomes during protein biosynthesis. Also plays a role in the regulation of autophagy and innate immunity. Recruits ATG5-ATG12 and NLRX1 at mitochondria and serves as a checkpoint of the RIGI-MAVS pathway. In turn, inhibits RLR-mediated type I interferon while promoting autophagy.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
