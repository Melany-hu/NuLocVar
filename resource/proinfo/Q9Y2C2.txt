UniprotID	Q9Y2C2
Accession	Q9Y2C2;B2RCX6
EntryName	UST_HUMAN
ProteinName	Uronyl 2-sulfotransferase (EC 2.8.2.-) (Chondroitin sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase) (CS-2OST)
GeneName	UST DS2ST
Length	406
Function	Sulfotransferase that catalyzes the transfer of sulfate to the position 2 of uronyl residues in glycosaminoglycan chains (PubMed:10187838, PubMed:17227754). Has mainly activity toward iduronyl residues in dermatan sulfate, and weaker activity toward glucuronyl residues of chondroitin sulfate (PubMed:10187838). Has little to no activity toward desulfated N-resulfated heparin or N-sulfoheparosan (PubMed:10187838, PubMed:17227754).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
