Accession	Q8WTS6;B5WWL3;Q0VAH3;Q4W5A9;Q9C0E6
EntryName	SETD7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD7 (EC 2.1.1.364) (Histone H3-K4 methyltransferase SETD7) (H3-K4-HMTase SETD7) (Lysine N-methyltransferase 7) (SET domain-containing protein 7) (SET7/9)
GeneName	SETD7 KIAA1717 KMT7 SET7 SET9
Length	366
Function	Histone methyltransferase that specifically monomethylates 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (PubMed:11779497, PubMed:11850410, PubMed:12540855, PubMed:12588998, PubMed:16141209). H3 'Lys-4' methylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation (PubMed:12540855, PubMed:12588998, PubMed:16141209). Plays a central role in the transcriptional activation of genes such as collagenase or insulin (PubMed:12588998, PubMed:16141209). Recruited by IPF1/PDX-1 to the insulin promoter, leading to activate transcription (PubMed:16141209). Also has methyltransferase activity toward non-histone proteins such as CGAS, p53/TP53, TAF10, and possibly TAF7 by recognizing and binding the --K in substrate proteins (PubMed:15099517, PubMed:15525938, PubMed:16415881, PubMed:35210392). Monomethylates 'Lys-189' of TAF10, leading to increase the affinity of TAF10 for RNA polymerase II (PubMed:15099517, PubMed:16415881). Monomethylates 'Lys-372' of p53/TP53, stabilizing p53/TP53 and increasing p53/TP53-mediated transcriptional activation (PubMed:15525938, PubMed:16415881, PubMed:17108971). Monomethylates 'Lys-491' of CGAS, promoting interaction between SGF29 and CGAS (By similarity).
