UniprotID	Q15170
Accession	Q15170;Q9UJQ9
EntryName	TCAL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription elongation factor A protein-like 1 (TCEA-like protein 1) (Nuclear phosphoprotein p21/SIIR) (Transcription elongation factor S-II protein-like 1)
GeneName	TCEAL1 SIIR
Length	159
Function	May be involved in transcriptional regulation. Modulates various viral and cellular promoters in a promoter context-dependent manner. For example, transcription from the FOS promoter is increased, while Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter activity is repressed. Does not bind DNA directly.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
