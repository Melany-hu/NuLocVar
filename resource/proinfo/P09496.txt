EntryName	CLCA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Clathrin light chain A (Lca)
GeneName	CLTA
Length	248
Function	Clathrin is the major protein of the polyhedral coat of coated pits and vesicles. Acts as a component of the TACC3/ch-TOG/clathrin complex proposed to contribute to stabilization of kinetochore fibers of the mitotic spindle by acting as inter-microtubule bridge (PubMed:15858577, PubMed:21297582).
