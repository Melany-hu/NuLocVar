EntryName	CTBL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-catenin-like protein 1 (Nuclear-associated protein) (NAP) (Testis development protein NYD-SP19)
GeneName	CTNNBL1 C20orf33 PP8304
Length	563
Function	Component of the PRP19-CDC5L complex that forms an integral part of the spliceosome and is required for activating pre-mRNA splicing. Participates in AID/AICDA-mediated somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR), 2 processes resulting in the production of high-affinity, mutated isotype-switched antibodies (PubMed:32484799).
