UniprotID	Q9HAZ1
Accession	Q9HAZ1
EntryName	CLK4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity protein kinase CLK4 (EC 2.7.12.1) (CDC-like kinase 4)
GeneName	CLK4
Length	481
Function	Dual specificity kinase acting on both serine/threonine and tyrosine-containing substrates. Phosphorylates serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins of the spliceosomal complex and may be a constituent of a network of regulatory mechanisms that enable SR proteins to control RNA splicing. Phosphorylates SRSF1 and SRSF3. Required for the regulation of alternative splicing of MAPT/TAU. Regulates the alternative splicing of tissue factor (F3) pre-mRNA in endothelial cells.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
