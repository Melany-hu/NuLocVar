UniprotID	Q9NPG8
Accession	Q9NPG8;A4D2N9;Q53EV7;Q6FIB5;Q9H0R9
EntryName	ZDHC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC4 (EC 2.3.1.225) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 4) (DHHC-4) (Zinc finger protein 374)
GeneName	ZDHHC4 ZNF374 DC1 UNQ5787/PRO19576
Length	344
Function	Palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of palmitate onto protein substrates including the D(2) dopamine receptor DRD2, GSK3B or MAVS. Mediates GSK3B palmitoylation to prevent its AKT1-mediated phosphorylation leading to activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway (PubMed:35606353). Also catalyzes MAVS palmitoylation which promotes its stabilization and activation by inhibiting 'Lys-48'- but facilitating 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination (PubMed:38016475).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Cell membrane
