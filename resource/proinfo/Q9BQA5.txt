UniprotID	Q9BQA5
Accession	Q9BQA5;B3KPH6;B4DWB4;E9PQF4;Q96E65;Q9Y4M7
EntryName	HINFP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H4 transcription factor (Histone nuclear factor P) (HiNF-P) (MBD2-interacting zinc finger protein) (Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2-interacting zinc finger protein)
GeneName	HINFP MIZF ZNF743
Length	517
Function	Transcriptional repressor that binds to the consensus sequence 5'-CGGACGTT-3' and to the RB1 promoter. Transcriptional activator that promotes histone H4 gene transcription at the G1/S phase transition in conjunction with NPAT. Also activates transcription of the ATM and PRKDC genes. Autoregulates its expression by associating with its own promoter.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
