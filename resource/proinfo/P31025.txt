UniprotID	P31025
Accession	P31025;Q5T8A1
EntryName	LCN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lipocalin-1 (Tear lipocalin) (Tlc) (Tear prealbumin) (TP) (von Ebner gland protein) (VEG protein)
GeneName	LCN1 VEGP
Length	176
Function	Could play a role in taste reception. Could be necessary for the concentration and delivery of sapid molecules in the gustatory system. Can bind various ligands, with chemical structures ranging from lipids and retinoids to the macrocyclic antibiotic rifampicin and even to microbial siderophores. Exhibits an extremely wide ligand pocket.
