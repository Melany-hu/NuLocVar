EntryName	MO4L2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mortality factor 4-like protein 2 (MORF-related gene X protein) (Protein MSL3-2) (Transcription factor-like protein MRGX)
GeneName	MORF4L2 KIAA0026 MRGX
Length	288
Function	Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex which is involved in transcriptional activation of select genes principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histone H4 and H2A. This modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription. This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence, apoptosis, and DNA repair. The NuA4 complex ATPase and helicase activities seem to be, at least in part, contributed by the association of RUVBL1 and RUVBL2 with EP400. NuA4 may also play a direct role in DNA repair when directly recruited to sites of DNA damage. Also a component of the MSIN3A complex which acts to repress transcription by deacetylation of nucleosomal histones.
