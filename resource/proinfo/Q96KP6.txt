UniprotID	Q96KP6
Accession	Q96KP6;A1A574;A8K2Z4;B4DVF5;B4E023;Q96PQ3;Q9H780
EntryName	TNIP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	TNFAIP3-interacting protein 3 (A20-binding inhibitor of NF-kappa-B activation 3) (ABIN-3) (Listeria-induced gene protein)
GeneName	TNIP3 ABIN3 LIND
Length	325
Function	Binds to zinc finger protein TNFAIP3 and inhibits NF-kappa-B activation induced by tumor necrosis factor, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), interleukin-1 and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Overexpression inhibits NF-kappa-B-dependent gene expression in response to lipopolysaccharide at a level downstream of TRAF6 and upstream of IKBKB. NF-kappa-B inhibition is independent of TNFAIP3 binding.
