EntryName	MEOX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein MOX-2 (Growth arrest-specific homeobox) (Mesenchyme homeobox 2)
GeneName	MEOX2 GAX MOX2
Length	304
Function	Mesodermal transcription factor that plays a key role in somitogenesis and somitogenesis and limb muscle differentiation (By similarity). Required during limb development for normal appendicular muscle formation and for the normal regulation of myogenic genes (By similarity). May have a regulatory role when quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells reenter the cell cycle (By similarity). Also acts as a negative regulator of angiogenesis (PubMed:17074759, PubMed:20516212, PubMed:22206000). Activates expression of CDKN1A and CDKN2A in endothelial cells, acting as a regulator of vascular cell proliferation (PubMed:17074759, PubMed:22206000). While it activates CDKN1A in a DNA-dependent manner, it activates CDKN2A in a DNA-independent manner (PubMed:22206000). Together with TCF15, regulates transcription in heart endothelial cells to regulate fatty acid transport across heart endothelial cells (By similarity).
