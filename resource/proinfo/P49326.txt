EntryName	FMO5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Flavin-containing monooxygenase 5 (FMO 5) (Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase 1) (hBVMO1) (EC 1.14.13.-) (Dimethylaniline monooxygenase [N-oxide-forming] 5) (EC 1.14.13.8) (Dimethylaniline oxidase 5) (NADPH oxidase) (EC 1.6.3.1)
GeneName	FMO5
Length	533
Function	Acts as a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase on a broad range of substrates. Catalyzes the insertion of an oxygen atom into a carbon-carbon bond adjacent to a carbonyl, which converts ketones to esters (PubMed:20947616, PubMed:26771671, PubMed:28783300). Active on diverse carbonyl compounds, whereas soft nucleophiles are mostly non- or poorly reactive (PubMed:26771671, PubMed:7872795). In contrast with other forms of FMO it is non- or poorly active on 'classical' substrates such as drugs, pesticides, and dietary components containing soft nucleophilic heteroatoms (Probable) (PubMed:7872795). Able to oxidize drug molecules bearing a carbonyl group on an aliphatic chain, such as nabumetone and pentoxifylline (PubMed:28783300). Also, in the absence of substrates, shows slow but yet significant NADPH oxidase activity (PubMed:26771671). Acts as a positive modulator of cholesterol biosynthesis as well as glucose homeostasis, promoting metabolic aging via pleiotropic effects (By similarity).
