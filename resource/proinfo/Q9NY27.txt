Accession	Q9NY27;A8K1I6;Q2TAJ9;Q498B8;Q8WXX6
EntryName	PP4R2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 4 regulatory subunit 2
GeneName	PPP4R2 SBBI57
Length	417
Function	Regulatory subunit of serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 4 (PP4). May regulate the activity of PPP4C at centrosomal microtubule organizing centers. Its interaction with the SMN complex leads to enhance the temporal localization of snRNPs, suggesting a role of PPP4C in maturation of spliceosomal snRNPs. The PPP4C-PPP4R2-PPP4R3A PP4 complex specifically dephosphorylates H2AX phosphorylated on 'Ser-140' (gamma-H2AX) generated during DNA replication and required for DNA double strand break repair. Mediates RPA2 dephosphorylation by recruiting PPP4C to RPA2 in a DNA damage-dependent manner. RPA2 dephosphorylation is required for the efficient RPA2-mediated recruitment of RAD51 to chromatin following double strand breaks, an essential step for DNA repair.
