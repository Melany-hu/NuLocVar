EntryName	ETFB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Electron transfer flavoprotein subunit beta (Beta-ETF)
GeneName	ETFB FP585
Length	255
Function	Heterodimeric electron transfer flavoprotein that accepts electrons from several mitochondrial dehydrogenases, including acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, glutaryl-CoA and sarcosine dehydrogenase (PubMed:15159392, PubMed:15975918, PubMed:25416781). It transfers the electrons to the main mitochondrial respiratory chain via ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Probable). Required for normal mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and normal amino acid metabolism (PubMed:12815589, PubMed:7912128). ETFB binds an AMP molecule that probably has a purely structural role (PubMed:15159392, PubMed:15975918, PubMed:8962055).
