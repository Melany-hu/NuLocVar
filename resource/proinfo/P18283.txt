UniprotID	P18283
Accession	P18283;Q6PJ52;Q8WWI7;Q9NRP9
EntryName	GPX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPx-2) (GSHPx-2) (EC 1.11.1.9) (Gastrointestinal glutathione peroxidase) (Glutathione peroxidase-gastrointestinal) (GPx-GI) (GSHPx-GI) (Glutathione peroxidase-related protein 2) (GPRP-2) (Phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase GPX2) (EC 1.11.1.12)
GeneName	GPX2
Length	190
Function	Catalyzes the reduction of hydroperoxides in a glutathione-dependent manner thus regulating cellular redox homeostasis (PubMed:36608588, PubMed:8428933). Can reduce small soluble hydroperoxides such as H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, as well as several fatty acid-derived hydroperoxides (PubMed:36608588, PubMed:8428933). Cannot reduce phosphatidycholine hydroperoxide (PubMed:8428933).
