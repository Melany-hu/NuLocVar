UniprotID	Q8TDX5
Accession	Q8TDX5;Q3B7X3;Q53SR5;Q96KY2
EntryName	ACMSD_HUMAN
ProteinName	2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.45) (Picolinate carboxylase)
GeneName	ACMSD
Length	336
Function	Converts alpha-amino-beta-carboxymuconate-epsilon-semialdehyde (ACMS) to alpha-aminomuconate semialdehyde (AMS). ACMS can be converted non-enzymatically to quinolate (QA), a key precursor of NAD, and a potent endogenous excitotoxin of neuronal cells which is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. In the presence of ACMSD, ACMS is converted to AMS, a benign catabolite. ACMSD ultimately controls the metabolic fate of tryptophan catabolism along the kynurenine pathway.
