UniprotID	Q9H9K5
Accession	Q9H9K5;B3KTB4;Q0P5R3;Q6NWN0
EntryName	MER34_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endogenous retroviral envelope protein HEMO (Endogenous retrovirus group MER34 member 1 Env polyprotein) (HERV-MER_4q12 provirus ancestral Env polyprotein) (Human endogenous MER34 (medium-reiteration-frequency-family-34) open reading frame) (Human endogenous MER34 ORF) (HEMO) [Cleaved into: Endogenous retroviral envelope protein HEMO, secreted form (Endogenous retroviral envelope protein HEMO, 48 kDa form)]
GeneName	ERVMER34-1 HEMO LP9056
Length	563
Function	Endogenous envelope proteins originate from retroviral envelope proteins, which mediate receptor recognition and membrane fusion during early infection. Endogenous envelope proteins may have kept, lost or modified their original function during evolution.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted
