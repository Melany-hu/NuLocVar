UniprotID	Q969S2
Accession	Q969S2;B4DFR7;Q7Z3Q7;Q8N842;Q8NG52
EntryName	NEIL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endonuclease 8-like 2 (EC 3.2.2.-) (EC 4.2.99.18) (DNA glycosylase/AP lyase Neil2) (DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase Neil2) (Endonuclease VIII-like 2) (Nei homolog 2) (NEH2) (Nei-like protein 2)
GeneName	NEIL2
Length	332
Function	Involved in base excision repair of DNA damaged by oxidation or by mutagenic agents. Has DNA glycosylase activity towards 5-hydroxyuracil and other oxidized derivatives of cytosine with a preference for mismatched double-stranded DNA (DNA bubbles). Has low or no DNA glycosylase activity towards thymine glycol, 2-hydroxyadenine, hypoxanthine and 8-oxoguanine. Has AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) lyase activity and introduces nicks in the DNA strand. Cleaves the DNA backbone by beta-delta elimination to generate a single-strand break at the site of the removed base with both 3'- and 5'-phosphates.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
