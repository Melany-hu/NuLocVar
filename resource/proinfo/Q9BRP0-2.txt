UniprotID	Q9BRP0-2
Accession	Q9BRP0;Q5T8B4;Q9BX22;Q9HA54;Q9Y4M0
EntryName	OVOL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor Ovo-like 2 (hOvo2) (Zinc finger protein 339)
GeneName	OVOL2 ZNF339
Length	143
Function	Zinc-finger transcription repressor factor (PubMed:19700410). Plays a critical role in maintaining the identity of epithelial lineages by suppressing epithelial-to mesenchymal transition (EMT) mainly through the repression of ZEB1, an EMT inducer (By similarity). Positively regulates neuronal differentiation (By similarity). Suppresses cell cycling and terminal differentiation of keratinocytes by directly repressing MYC and NOTCH1 (PubMed:19700410). Important for the correct development of primordial germ cells in embryos (By similarity). Plays dual functions in thermogenesis and adipogenesis to maintain energy balance. Essential for brown/beige adipose tissue-mediated thermogenesis, is necessary for the development of brown adipocytes. In white adipose tissues, limits adipogenesis by blocking CEBPA binding to its transcriptional targets and inhibiting its transcription factor activity (By similarity).
