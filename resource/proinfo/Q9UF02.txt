UniprotID	Q9UF02
Accession	Q9UF02;A8K2A6;Q547R3;Q8WXS7;Q9UHM3
EntryName	CCG5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Voltage-dependent calcium channel gamma-5 subunit (Neuronal voltage-gated calcium channel gamma-5 subunit) (Transmembrane AMPAR regulatory protein gamma-5) (TARP gamma-5)
GeneName	CACNG5
Length	275
Function	Regulates the gating properties of AMPA-selective glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Modulates their gating properties by accelerating their rates of activation, deactivation and desensitization. Displays subunit-specific AMPA receptor regulation. Shows specificity for GRIA1, GRIA4 and the long isoform of GRIA2. Thought to stabilize the calcium channel in an inactivated (closed) state (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Postsynaptic density membrane
