UniprotID	Q147X3
Accession	Q147X3;Q0IIN2
EntryName	NAA30_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-alpha-acetyltransferase 30 (EC 2.3.1.256) (N-acetyltransferase 12) (N-acetyltransferase MAK3 homolog) (NatC catalytic subunit)
GeneName	NAA30 C14orf35 MAK3 NAT12
Length	362
Function	Catalytic subunit of the N-terminal acetyltransferase C (NatC) complex (PubMed:19398576, PubMed:37891180). Catalyzes acetylation of the N-terminal methionine residues of peptides beginning with Met-Leu-Ala and Met-Leu-Gly (PubMed:19398576, PubMed:37891180). N-terminal acetylation protects proteins from ubiquitination and degradation by the N-end rule pathway (PubMed:37891180). Necessary for the lysosomal localization and function of ARL8B sugeesting that ARL8B is a NatC substrate (PubMed:19398576).
