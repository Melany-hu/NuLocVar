ProteinName	Superkiller complex protein 8 (Ski8) (Meiotic recombination REC14 protein homolog) (WD repeat-containing protein 61) [Cleaved into: Superkiller complex protein 8, N-terminally processed (WD repeat-containing protein 61, N-terminally processed)]
GeneName	SKIC8 WDR61
Length	305
Function	Component of the PAF1 complex (PAF1C) which has multiple functions during transcription by RNA polymerase II and is implicated in regulation of development and maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency (PubMed:16307923, PubMed:19952111, PubMed:20178742). PAF1C associates with RNA polymerase II through interaction with POLR2A CTD non-phosphorylated and 'Ser-2'- and 'Ser-5'-phosphorylated forms and is involved in transcriptional elongation, acting both independently and synergistically with TCEA1 and in cooperation with the DSIF complex and HTATSF1 (PubMed:16307923, PubMed:19952111, PubMed:20178742). PAF1C is required for transcription of Hox and Wnt target genes (PubMed:16307923, PubMed:19952111, PubMed:20178742). PAF1C is involved in hematopoiesis and stimulates transcriptional activity of KMT2A/MLL1; it promotes leukemogenesis through association with KMT2A/MLL1-rearranged oncoproteins, such as KMT2A/MLL1-MLLT3/AF9 and KMT2A/MLL1-MLLT1/ENL (PubMed:16307923, PubMed:19952111, PubMed:20178742). PAF1C is involved in histone modifications such as ubiquitination of histone H2B and methylation on histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3) (PubMed:16307923, PubMed:19952111, PubMed:20178742). PAF1C recruits the RNF20/40 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex and the E2 enzyme UBE2A or UBE2B to chromatin which mediate monoubiquitination of 'Lys-120' of histone H2B (H2BK120ub1); UB2A/B-mediated H2B ubiquitination is proposed to be coupled to transcription (PubMed:16307923, PubMed:19952111, PubMed:20178742). PAF1C is involved in mRNA 3' end formation probably through association with cleavage and poly(A) factors (PubMed:16307923, PubMed:19952111, PubMed:20178742). In case of infection by influenza A strain H3N2, PAF1C associates with viral NS1 protein, thereby regulating gene transcription (PubMed:16307923, PubMed:19952111, PubMed:20178742). Required for mono- and trimethylation on histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3), dimethylation on histone H3 'Lys-79' (H3K4me3). Required for Hox gene transcription (PubMed:16307923, PubMed:19952111, PubMed:20178742). Also acts as a component of the SKI complex, a multiprotein complex that assists the RNA-degrading exosome during the mRNA decay and quality-control pathways (PubMed:16024656, PubMed:32006463, PubMed:35120588). The SKI complex catalyzes mRNA extraction from 80S ribosomal complexes in the 3'-5' direction and channels mRNA to the cytosolic exosome for degradation (PubMed:32006463, PubMed:35120588). SKI-mediated extraction of mRNA from stalled ribosomes allow binding of the Pelota-HBS1L complex and subsequent ribosome disassembly by ABCE1 for ribosome recycling (PubMed:32006463).
