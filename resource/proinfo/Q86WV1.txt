UniprotID	Q86WV1
Accession	Q86WV1;D3DTV1;O15268
EntryName	SKAP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 1 (Src family-associated phosphoprotein 1) (Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein of 55 kDa) (SKAP-55) (pp55)
GeneName	SKAP1 SCAP1 SKAP55
Length	359
Function	Positively regulates T-cell receptor signaling by enhancing the MAP kinase pathway. Required for optimal conjugation between T-cells and antigen-presenting cells by promoting the clustering of integrin ITGAL on the surface of T-cells. May be involved in high affinity immunoglobulin epsilon receptor signaling in mast cells.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Cell membrane
