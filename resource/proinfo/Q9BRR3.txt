UniprotID	Q9BRR3
Accession	Q9BRR3;Q49AQ4
EntryName	PGAP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Post-GPI attachment to proteins factor 4 (Post-GPI attachment to proteins GalNAc transferase 4) (Transmembrane protein 246)
GeneName	PGAP4 C9orf125 TMEM246
Length	403
Function	Golgi-resident glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-N-acetylgalactosamine transferase involved in the lipid remodeling steps of GPI-anchor maturation. Lipid remodeling steps consist in the generation of 2 saturated fatty chains at the sn-2 position of GPI-anchors proteins (PubMed:29374258). Required for the initial step of GPI-GalNAc biosynthesis, transfers GalNAc to GPI in the Golgi after fatty acid remodeling by PGAP2 (PubMed:29374258).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
