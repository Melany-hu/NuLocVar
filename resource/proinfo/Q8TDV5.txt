UniprotID	Q8TDV5
Accession	Q8TDV5;Q495H7;Q4VBN3
EntryName	GP119_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucose-dependent insulinotropic receptor (G-protein coupled receptor 119)
GeneName	GPR119
Length	335
Function	Receptor for the endogenous fatty-acid ethanolamide oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Functions as a glucose-dependent insulinotropic receptor. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylate cyclase. Seems to act through a G(s) mediated pathway.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
