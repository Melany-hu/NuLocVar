EntryName	PCYOX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prenylcysteine oxidase 1 (EC 1.8.3.5) (Prenylcysteine lyase)
GeneName	PCYOX1 KIAA0908 PCL1 UNQ597/PRO1183
Length	505
Function	Prenylcysteine oxidase that cleaves the thioether bond of prenyl-L-cysteines, such as farnesylcysteine and geranylgeranylcysteine (PubMed:10585463, PubMed:11078725, PubMed:12186880). Only active against free prenylcysteines and not prenylcysteine residues within prenylated proteins or peptides (By similarity). Involved in the final step in the degradation of prenylated proteins, by degrading prenylcysteines after the protein has been degraded (PubMed:10585463).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome
