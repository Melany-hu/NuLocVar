UniprotID	P67870
Accession	P67870;B0UXA9;P07312;P13862;Q4VX47
EntryName	CSK2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Casein kinase II subunit beta (CK II beta) (Phosvitin) (Protein G5a)
GeneName	CSNK2B CK2N G5A
Length	215
Function	Regulatory subunit of casein kinase II/CK2. As part of the kinase complex regulates the basal catalytic activity of the alpha subunit a constitutively active serine/threonine-protein kinase that phosphorylates a large number of substrates containing acidic residues C-terminal to the phosphorylated serine or threonine (PubMed:11239457, PubMed:16818610). Participates in Wnt signaling (By similarity).
