UniprotID	P12034
Accession	P12034;B2R554;O75846;Q3Y8M3;Q8NF90
EntryName	FGF5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF-5) (Heparin-binding growth factor 5) (HBGF-5) (Smag-82)
GeneName	FGF5
Length	268
Function	Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation and cell differentiation. Required for normal regulation of the hair growth cycle. Functions as an inhibitor of hair elongation by promoting progression from anagen, the growth phase of the hair follicle, into catagen the apoptosis-induced regression phase (By similarity).
