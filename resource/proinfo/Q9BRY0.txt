UniprotID	Q9BRY0
Accession	Q9BRY0;B3KMJ3;Q8WUG1
EntryName	S39A3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc transporter ZIP3 (Solute carrier family 39 member 3) (Zrt- and Irt-like protein 3) (ZIP-3)
GeneName	SLC39A3 ZIP3
Length	314
Function	Transporter for the divalent cation Zn(2+). Mediates the influx of Zn(2+) into cells from extracellular space. Controls Zn(2+) accumulation into dentate gyrus granule cells in the hippocampus. Mediates Zn(2+) reuptake from the secreted milk within the alveolar lumen.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Apical cell membrane
