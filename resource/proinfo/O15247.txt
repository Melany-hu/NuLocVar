UniprotID	O15247
Accession	O15247;A8K9S0;O15174;Q5JT80;Q8TCE3
EntryName	CLIC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chloride intracellular channel protein 2 (Glutaredoxin-like oxidoreductase CLIC2) (EC 1.8.-.-) (Glutaredoxin-like peroxidase CLIC2) (EC 1.11.1.-) (XAP121)
GeneName	CLIC2
Length	247
Function	In the soluble state, catalyzes glutaredoxin-like thiol disulfide exchange reactions with reduced glutathione as electron donor. Displays weak glutathione peroxidase activity (Probable) (PubMed:25581026). Can insert into membranes and form chloride ion channels. Membrane insertion seems to be redox-regulated and may occur only under oxidizing conditions. Modulates the activity of RYR2 and inhibits calcium influx.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Membrane
