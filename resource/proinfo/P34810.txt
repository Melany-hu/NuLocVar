UniprotID	P34810
Accession	P34810;B4DVT4;Q53HR6;Q53XI3;Q96BI7
EntryName	CD68_HUMAN
ProteinName	Macrosialin (Gp110) (CD antigen CD68)
GeneName	CD68
Length	354
Function	Could play a role in phagocytic activities of tissue macrophages, both in intracellular lysosomal metabolism and extracellular cell-cell and cell-pathogen interactions. Binds to tissue- and organ-specific lectins or selectins, allowing homing of macrophage subsets to particular sites. Rapid recirculation of CD68 from endosomes and lysosomes to the plasma membrane may allow macrophages to crawl over selectin-bearing substrates or other cells.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane
