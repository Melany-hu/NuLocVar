UniprotID	Q9NPC6
Accession	Q9NPC6;O43415;Q9HB92
EntryName	MYOZ2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myozenin-2 (Calsarcin-1) (FATZ-related protein 2)
GeneName	MYOZ2 C4orf5
Length	264
Function	Myozenins may serve as intracellular binding proteins involved in linking Z line proteins such as alpha-actinin, gamma-filamin, TCAP/telethonin, LDB3/ZASP and localizing calcineurin signaling to the sarcomere. Plays an important role in the modulation of calcineurin signaling. May play a role in myofibrillogenesis.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Myofibril; Sarcomere; Z line
