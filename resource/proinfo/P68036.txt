EntryName	UB2L3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 L3 (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme L3) (L-UBC) (UbcH7) (Ubiquitin carrier protein L3) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-F1) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase L3)
GeneName	UBE2L3 UBCE7 UBCH7
Length	154
Function	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 that specifically acts with HECT-type and RBR family E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. Does not function with most RING-containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases because it lacks intrinsic E3-independent reactivity with lysine; in contrast, it has activity with the RBR family E3 enzymes, such as PRKN, RNF31 and ARIH1, that function like RING-HECT hybrids. Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. Mediates ubiquitination by the CUL9-RBX1 complex (PubMed:38605244). In vitro catalyzes 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitination. Involved in the selective degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins. Down-regulated during the S-phase it is involved in progression through the cell cycle. Regulates nuclear hormone receptors transcriptional activity. May play a role in myelopoiesis.
