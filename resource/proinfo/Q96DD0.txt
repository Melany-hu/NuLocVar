UniprotID	Q96DD0
Accession	Q96DD0;B3KUD2;D3DT56;Q5VVK7
EntryName	LRC39_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 39 (Myosin-interacting M-band-associated stress-responsive protein) (Myomasp)
GeneName	LRRC39 UNQ6500/PRO21368
Length	335
Function	Component of the sarcomeric M-band which plays a role in myocyte response to biomechanical stress. May regulate expression of other M-band proteins via an SRF-dependent pathway. Important for normal contractile function in heart.
