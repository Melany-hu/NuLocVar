EntryName	DHI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11-DH2) (11-beta-HSD2) (EC 1.1.1.-) (11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II) (11-HSD type II) (11-beta-HSD type II) (Corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 2) (NAD-dependent 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 3)
GeneName	HSD11B2 HSD11K SDR9C3
Length	405
Function	Catalyzes the conversion of biologically active 11beta-hydroxyglucocorticoids (11beta-hydroxysteroid) such as cortisol, to inactive 11-ketoglucocorticoids (11-oxosteroid) such as cortisone, in the presence of NAD(+) (PubMed:10497248, PubMed:12788846, PubMed:17314322, PubMed:22796344, PubMed:27927697, PubMed:30902677, PubMed:33387577, PubMed:7859916, PubMed:8538347). Functions as a dehydrogenase (oxidase), thereby decreasing the concentration of active glucocorticoids, thus protecting the nonselective mineralocorticoid receptor from occupation by glucocorticoids (PubMed:10497248, PubMed:12788846, PubMed:17314322, PubMed:33387577, PubMed:7859916). Plays an important role in maintaining glucocorticoids balance during preimplantation and protects the fetus from excessive maternal corticosterone exposure (By similarity). Catalyzes the oxidation of 11beta-hydroxytestosterone (11beta,17beta-dihydroxyandrost-4-ene-3-one) to 11-ketotestosterone (17beta-hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,11-dione), a major bioactive androgen (PubMed:22796344, PubMed:27927697). Catalyzes the conversion of 11beta-hydroxyandrostenedione (11beta-hydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione) to 11-ketoandrostenedione (androst-4-ene-3,11,17-trione), which can be further metabolized to 11-ketotestosterone (PubMed:27927697). Converts 7-beta-25-dihydroxycholesterol to 7-oxo-25-hydroxycholesterol in vitro (PubMed:30902677). 7-beta-25-dihydroxycholesterol (not 7-oxo-25-hydroxycholesterol) acts as a ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2) and may thereby regulate immune cell migration (PubMed:30902677). May protect ovulating oocytes and fertilizing spermatozoa from the adverse effects of cortisol (By similarity).
