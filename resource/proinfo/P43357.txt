UniprotID	P43357
Accession	P43357;Q6FHI6
EntryName	MAGA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Melanoma-associated antigen 3 (Antigen MZ2-D) (Cancer/testis antigen 1.3) (CT1.3) (MAGE-3 antigen)
GeneName	MAGEA3 MAGE3
Length	314
Function	Activator of ubiquitin ligase activity of RING-type zinc finger-containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases that acts as a repressor of autophagy (PubMed:20864041, PubMed:31267705). May enhance ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM28 and stimulate p53/TP53 ubiquitination by TRIM28. Proposed to act through recruitment and/or stabilization of the Ubl-conjugating enzyme (E2) at the E3:substrate complex (PubMed:17942928, PubMed:20864041). May play a role in embryonal development and tumor transformation or aspects of tumor progression (PubMed:17942928, PubMed:20864041). In vitro promotes cell viability in melanoma cell lines (PubMed:17942928). Antigen recognized on a melanoma by autologous cytolytic T-lymphocytes (PubMed:8113684).
