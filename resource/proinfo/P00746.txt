UniprotID	P00746
Accession	P00746;B4DV76;Q5U5S1;Q86VJ5;Q8N4E0;Q8WZB4
EntryName	CFAD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complement factor D (EC 3.4.21.46) (Adipsin) (C3 convertase activator) (Properdin factor D)
GeneName	CFD DF PFD
Length	253
Function	Factor D cleaves factor B when the latter is complexed with factor C3b, activating the C3bbb complex, which then becomes the C3 convertase of the alternate pathway. Its function is homologous to that of C1s in the classical pathway.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
