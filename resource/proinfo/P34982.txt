UniprotID	P34982
Accession	P34982;Q6IFL8;Q96RA4;Q9UM78
EntryName	OR1D2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Olfactory receptor 1D2 (Olfactory receptor 17-4) (OR17-4) (Olfactory receptor OR17-6) (Olfactory receptor-like protein HGMP07E)
GeneName	OR1D2 OLFR1
Length	312
Function	Odorant receptor which may be involved in sperm chemotaxis. Bourgeonal is a strong chemoattractant for sperm in vitro and is shown to be a strong agonist for OR1D2 in vitro. May also function in olfactory reception.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
