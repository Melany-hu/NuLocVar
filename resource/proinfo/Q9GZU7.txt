UniprotID	Q9GZU7
Accession	Q9GZU7;C9IYG0;Q7Z5Q3;Q7Z5Q4
EntryName	CTDS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carboxy-terminal domain RNA polymerase II polypeptide A small phosphatase 1 (EC 3.1.3.16) (Nuclear LIM interactor-interacting factor 3) (NLI-IF) (NLI-interacting factor 3) (Small C-terminal domain phosphatase 1) (SCP1) (Small CTD phosphatase 1)
GeneName	CTDSP1 NIF3 NLIIF SCP1
Length	261
Function	Preferentially catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 'Ser-5' within the tandem 7 residue repeats in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2A. Negatively regulates RNA polymerase II transcription, possibly by controlling the transition from initiation/capping to processive transcript elongation. Recruited by REST to neuronal genes that contain RE-1 elements, leading to neuronal gene silencing in non-neuronal cells.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
