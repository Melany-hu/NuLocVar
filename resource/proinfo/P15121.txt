EntryName	ALDR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B1 (EC 1.1.1.21) (EC 1.1.1.300) (EC 1.1.1.372) (EC 1.1.1.54) (Aldehyde reductase) (Aldose reductase) (AR)
GeneName	AKR1B1 ALDR1 ALR2
Length	316
Function	Catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a wide variety of carbonyl-containing compounds to their corresponding alcohols. Displays enzymatic activity towards endogenous metabolites such as aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, ketones, monosacharides, bile acids and xenobiotics substrates. Key enzyme in the polyol pathway, catalyzes reduction of glucose to sorbitol during hyperglycemia (PubMed:1936586). Reduces steroids and their derivatives and prostaglandins. Displays low enzymatic activity toward all-trans-retinal, 9-cis-retinal, and 13-cis-retinal (PubMed:12732097, PubMed:19010934, PubMed:8343525). Catalyzes the reduction of diverse phospholipid aldehydes such as 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn -glycero-3-phosphoethanolamin (POVPC) and related phospholipid aldehydes that are generated from the oxydation of phosphotidylcholine and phosphatdyleethanolamides (PubMed:17381426). Plays a role in detoxifying dietary and lipid-derived unsaturated carbonyls, such as crotonaldehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, trans-2-hexenal, trans-2,4-hexadienal and their glutathione-conjugates carbonyls (GS-carbonyls) (PubMed:21329684).
