UniprotID	Q13356
Accession	Q13356;Q13357;Q8TAH2;Q9BWR8
EntryName	PPIL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	RING-type E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase PPIL2 (EC 2.3.2.27) (CYC4) (Cyclophilin-60) (Cyclophilin-like protein Cyp-60) (Cyp60) (hCyP-60) (Probable inactive peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase-like 2) (PPIase) (Rotamase PPIL2)
GeneName	PPIL2
Length	520
Function	Has a ubiquitin-protein ligase activity acting as an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase or as an ubiquitin-ubiquitin ligase promoting elongation of ubiquitin chains on substrates. By mediating 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination of proteins could target them for proteasomal degradation (PubMed:11435423). May also function as a chaperone, playing a role in transport to the cell membrane of BSG/Basigin for instance (PubMed:15946952). Probable inactive PPIase with no peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity (PubMed:20676357). As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (Probable).
