UniprotID	Q99697
Accession	Q99697;A8K6C6;B2RA02;B3KXS0;O60578;O60579;O60580;Q3KQX9;Q9BY17
EntryName	PITX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pituitary homeobox 2 (ALL1-responsive protein ARP1) (Homeobox protein PITX2) (Paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2) (RIEG bicoid-related homeobox transcription factor) (Solurshin)
GeneName	PITX2 ARP1 RGS RIEG RIEG1
Length	317
Function	May play a role in myoblast differentiation. When unphosphorylated, associates with an ELAVL1-containing complex, which stabilizes cyclin mRNA and ensuring cell proliferation. Phosphorylation by AKT2 impairs this association, leading to CCND1 mRNA destabilization and progression towards differentiation.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm
