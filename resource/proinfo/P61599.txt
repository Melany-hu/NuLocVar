UniprotID	P61599
Accession	P61599;A6NHA3;B2R4G4;Q5TFT7;Q9D7H8;Q9H0Y4;Q9NQH6;Q9Y6D2
EntryName	NAA20_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-alpha-acetyltransferase 20 (EC 2.3.1.254) (Methionine N-acetyltransferase) (N-acetyltransferase 5) (N-terminal acetyltransferase B complex catalytic subunit NAA20) (N-terminal acetyltransferase B complex catalytic subunit NAT5) (NatB complex subunit NAT5) (NatB catalytic subunit)
GeneName	NAA20 NAT5
Length	178
Function	Catalytic subunit of the NatB complex which catalyzes acetylation of the N-terminal methionine residues of peptides beginning with Met-Asp, Met-Glu, Met-Asn and Met-Gln (PubMed:34230638). Proteins with cell cycle functions are overrepresented in the pool of NatB substrates. Required for maintaining the structure and function of actomyosin fibers and for proper cellular migration.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus
