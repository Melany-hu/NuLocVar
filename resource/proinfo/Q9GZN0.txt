EntryName	GPR88_HUMAN
ProteinName	G protein-coupled receptor 88 (Striatum-specific G-protein coupled receptor)
GeneName	GPR88 STRG
Length	384
Function	Orphan G protein-coupled receptor implicated in a large repertoire of behavioral responses that engage motor activities, spatial learning, and emotional processing (By similarity). May play a role in the regulation of cognitive and motor function (By similarity). Couples with the heterotrimeric G protein complex of the G(i) subfamily, consisting of GNAI1, GNB1 and GNG2, thereby acting through a G(i)-mediated pathway (PubMed:35501348). Plays a role in the attenuation of D1 dopamine receptor (D1R)-mediated cAMP response in ciliated cells (PubMed:23936473). In non-ciliated cells, involved in the inhibition of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR) response (PubMed:23936473).
