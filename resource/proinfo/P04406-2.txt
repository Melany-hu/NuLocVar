UniprotID	P04406-2
Accession	P04406;E7EUT4;P00354;Q53X65
EntryName	G3P_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (EC 1.2.1.12) (Peptidyl-cysteine S-nitrosylase GAPDH) (EC 2.6.99.-)
GeneName	GAPDH GAPD CDABP0047 OK/SW-cl.12
Length	293
Function	Has both glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and nitrosylase activities, thereby playing a role in glycolysis and nuclear functions, respectively (PubMed:11724794, PubMed:3170585). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a key enzyme in glycolysis that catalyzes the first step of the pathway by converting D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) into 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate (PubMed:11724794, PubMed:3170585). Modulates the organization and assembly of the cytoskeleton (By similarity). Facilitates the CHP1-dependent microtubule and membrane associations through its ability to stimulate the binding of CHP1 to microtubules (By similarity). Component of the GAIT (gamma interferon-activated inhibitor of translation) complex which mediates interferon-gamma-induced transcript-selective translation inhibition in inflammation processes (PubMed:23071094). Upon interferon-gamma treatment assembles into the GAIT complex which binds to stem loop-containing GAIT elements in the 3'-UTR of diverse inflammatory mRNAs (such as ceruplasmin) and suppresses their translation (PubMed:23071094). Also plays a role in innate immunity by promoting TNF-induced NF-kappa-B activation and type I interferon production, via interaction with TRAF2 and TRAF3, respectively (PubMed:23332158, PubMed:27387501). Participates in nuclear events including transcription, RNA transport, DNA replication and apoptosis (By similarity). Nuclear functions are probably due to the nitrosylase activity that mediates cysteine S-nitrosylation of nuclear target proteins such as SIRT1, HDAC2 and PRKDC (By similarity).
