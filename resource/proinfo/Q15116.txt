UniprotID	Q15116
Accession	Q15116;O00517;Q8IX89
EntryName	PDCD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Programmed cell death protein 1 (Protein PD-1) (hPD-1) (CD antigen CD279)
GeneName	PDCD1 PD1
Length	288
Function	Inhibitory receptor on antigen activated T-cells that plays a critical role in induction and maintenance of immune tolerance to self (PubMed:21276005). Delivers inhibitory signals upon binding to ligands CD274/PDCD1L1 and CD273/PDCD1LG2 (PubMed:21276005). Following T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement, PDCD1 associates with CD3-TCR in the immunological synapse and directly inhibits T-cell activation (By similarity). Suppresses T-cell activation through the recruitment of PTPN11/SHP-2: following ligand-binding, PDCD1 is phosphorylated within the ITSM motif, leading to the recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11/SHP-2 that mediates dephosphorylation of key TCR proximal signaling molecules, such as ZAP70, PRKCQ/PKCtheta and CD247/CD3zeta (By similarity).
