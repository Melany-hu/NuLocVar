UniprotID	Q9Y275
Accession	Q9Y275;E0ADT7;Q6FHD6;Q7Z5J2
EntryName	TN13B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 13B (B lymphocyte stimulator) (BLyS) (B-cell-activating factor) (BAFF) (Dendritic cell-derived TNF-like molecule) (TNF- and APOL-related leukocyte expressed ligand 1) (TALL-1) (CD antigen CD257) [Cleaved into: Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 13b, membrane form; Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 13b, soluble form]
GeneName	TNFSF13B BAFF BLYS TALL1 TNFSF20 ZTNF4 UNQ401/PRO738
Length	285
Function	Cytokine that binds to TNFRSF13B/TACI and TNFRSF17/BCMA. TNFSF13/APRIL binds to the same 2 receptors. Together, they form a 2 ligands -2 receptors pathway involved in the stimulation of B- and T-cell function and the regulation of humoral immunity. A third B-cell specific BAFF-receptor (BAFFR/BR3) promotes the survival of mature B-cells and the B-cell response.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted
