EntryName	DAF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complement decay-accelerating factor (CD antigen CD55)
GeneName	CD55 CR DAF
Length	381
Function	This protein recognizes C4b and C3b fragments that condense with cell-surface hydroxyl or amino groups when nascent C4b and C3b are locally generated during C4 and c3 activation. Interaction of daf with cell-associated C4b and C3b polypeptides interferes with their ability to catalyze the conversion of C2 and factor B to enzymatically active C2a and Bb and thereby prevents the formation of C4b2a and C3bBb, the amplification convertases of the complement cascade (PubMed:7525274). Inhibits complement activation by destabilizing and preventing the formation of C3 and C5 convertases, which prevents complement damage (PubMed:28657829).
