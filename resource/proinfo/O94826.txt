UniprotID	O94826
Accession	O94826;D3DN48
EntryName	TOM70_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM70 (Mitochondrial precursor proteins import receptor) (Translocase of outer membrane 70 kDa subunit) (Translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane protein 70)
GeneName	TOMM70 KIAA0719 TOM70 TOMM70A
Length	608
Function	Acts as a receptor of the preprotein translocase complex of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM complex) (PubMed:12526792). Recognizes and mediates the translocation of mitochondrial preproteins from the cytosol into the mitochondria in a chaperone dependent manner (PubMed:12526792, PubMed:35025629). Mediates TBK1 and IRF3 activation induced by MAVS in response to Sendai virus infection and promotes host antiviral responses during virus infection (PubMed:20628368, PubMed:25609812, PubMed:32728199). Upon Sendai virus infection, recruits HSP90AA1:IRF3:BAX in mitochondrion and the complex induces apoptosis (PubMed:25609812).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane
