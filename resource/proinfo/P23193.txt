UniprotID	P23193
Accession	P23193;A6NF25;A8K339;Q15563;Q6FG87
EntryName	TCEA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription elongation factor A protein 1 (Transcription elongation factor S-II protein 1) (Transcription elongation factor TFIIS.o)
GeneName	TCEA1 GTF2S TFIIS
Length	301
Function	Necessary for efficient RNA polymerase II transcription elongation past template-encoded arresting sites. The arresting sites in DNA have the property of trapping a certain fraction of elongating RNA polymerases that pass through, resulting in locked ternary complexes. Cleavage of the nascent transcript by S-II allows the resumption of elongation from the new 3'-terminus.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
