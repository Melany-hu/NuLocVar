UniprotID	Q96E29
Accession	Q96E29;B3KMG6;G3V130;Q9Y301
EntryName	MTEF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription termination factor 3, mitochondrial (Mitochondrial transcription termination factor 3) (mTERF3) (mTERF domain-containing protein 1, mitochondrial)
GeneName	MTERF3 MTERFD1 CGI-12
Length	417
Function	Binds promoter DNA and regulates initiation of transcription (PubMed:17662942). Required for normal mitochondrial transcription and translation, and for normal assembly of mitochondrial respiratory complexes. Required for normal mitochondrial function (By similarity). Maintains 16S rRNA levels and functions in mitochondrial ribosome assembly by regulating the biogenesis of the 39S ribosomal subunit (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
