UniprotID	P12104
Accession	P12104;Q2NKJ1
EntryName	FABPI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fatty acid-binding protein, intestinal (Fatty acid-binding protein 2) (Intestinal-type fatty acid-binding protein) (I-FABP)
GeneName	FABP2 FABPI
Length	132
Function	FABPs are thought to play a role in the intracellular transport of long-chain fatty acids and their acyl-CoA esters. FABP2 is probably involved in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein synthesis. Binds saturated long-chain fatty acids with a high affinity, but binds with a lower affinity to unsaturated long-chain fatty acids. FABP2 may also help maintain energy homeostasis by functioning as a lipid sensor.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
