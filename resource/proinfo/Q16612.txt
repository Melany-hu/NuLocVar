UniprotID	Q16612
Accession	Q16612;B2RDN8;B7Z5D2;D3DSZ8
EntryName	NREP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuronal regeneration-related protein (Neuronal protein 3.1) (Protein p311)
GeneName	NREP C5orf13 P311
Length	68
Function	May have roles in neural function. Ectopic expression augments motility of gliomas. Also promotes axonal regeneration (By similarity). May also have functions in cellular differentiation (By similarity). Induces differentiation of fibroblast into myofibroblast and myofibroblast ameboid migration. Increases retinoic-acid regulation of lipid-droplet biogenesis (By similarity). Down-regulates the expression of TGFB1 and TGFB2 but not of TGFB3 (By similarity). May play a role in the regulation of alveolar generation.
