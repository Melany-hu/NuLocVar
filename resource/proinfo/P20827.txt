UniprotID	P20827
Accession	P20827;D3DV86;Q5SR60;Q5SR61;Q6I9T9;Q8N578
EntryName	EFNA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ephrin-A1 (EPH-related receptor tyrosine kinase ligand 1) (LERK-1) (Immediate early response protein B61) (Tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 4) (TNF alpha-induced protein 4) [Cleaved into: Ephrin-A1, secreted form]
GeneName	EFNA1 EPLG1 LERK1 TNFAIP4
Length	205
Function	Cell surface GPI-bound ligand for Eph receptors, a family of receptor tyrosine kinases which are crucial for migration, repulsion and adhesion during neuronal, vascular and epithelial development. Binds promiscuously Eph receptors residing on adjacent cells, leading to contact-dependent bidirectional signaling into neighboring cells. Plays an important role in angiogenesis and tumor neovascularization. The recruitment of VAV2, VAV3 and PI3-kinase p85 subunit by phosphorylated EPHA2 is critical for EFNA1-induced RAC1 GTPase activation and vascular endothelial cell migration and assembly. Exerts anti-oncogenic effects in tumor cells through activation and down-regulation of EPHA2. Activates EPHA2 by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation which leads to its internalization and degradation. Acts as a negative regulator in the tumorigenesis of gliomas by down-regulating EPHA2 and FAK. Can evoke collapse of embryonic neuronal growth cone and regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis.
