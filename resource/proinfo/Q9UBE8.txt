UniprotID	Q9UBE8

EntryName	NLK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase NLK (EC 2.7.11.24) (Nemo-like kinase) (Protein LAK1)
GeneName	NLK LAK1
Length	527
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase that regulates a number of transcription factors with key roles in cell fate determination (PubMed:12482967, PubMed:14960582, PubMed:15004007, PubMed:15764709, PubMed:20061393, PubMed:20874444, PubMed:21454679). Positive effector of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, acting downstream of WNT5A, MAP3K7/TAK1 and HIPK2 (PubMed:15004007, PubMed:15764709). Negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (PubMed:12482967). Binds to and phosphorylates TCF7L2/TCF4 and LEF1, promoting the dissociation of the TCF7L2/LEF1/beta-catenin complex from DNA, as well as the ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis of LEF1 (PubMed:21454679). Together these effects inhibit the transcriptional activation of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin target genes (PubMed:12482967, PubMed:21454679). Negative regulator of the Notch signaling pathway (PubMed:20118921). Binds to and phosphorylates NOTCH1, thereby preventing the formation of a transcriptionally active ternary complex of NOTCH1, RBPJ/RBPSUH and MAML1 (PubMed:20118921). Negative regulator of the MYB family of transcription factors (PubMed:15082531). Phosphorylation of MYB leads to its subsequent proteolysis while phosphorylation of MYBL1 and MYBL2 inhibits their interaction with the coactivator CREBBP (PubMed:15082531). Other transcription factors may also be inhibited by direct phosphorylation of CREBBP itself (PubMed:15082531). Acts downstream of IL6 and MAP3K7/TAK1 to phosphorylate STAT3, which is in turn required for activation of NLK by MAP3K7/TAK1 (PubMed:15004007, PubMed:15764709). Upon IL1B stimulus, cooperates with ATF5 to activate the transactivation activity of C/EBP subfamily members (PubMed:25512613). Phosphorylates ATF5 but also stabilizes ATF5 protein levels in a kinase-independent manner (PubMed:25512613). Acts as an inhibitor of the mTORC1 complex in response to osmotic stress by mediating phosphorylation of RPTOR, thereby preventing recruitment of the mTORC1 complex to lysosomes (PubMed:26588989).
