UniprotID	Q86YS6-2
Accession	Q86YS6;A8K4P9;E9PBQ0
EntryName	RAB43_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-43 (Ras-related protein Rab-41)
GeneName	RAB43 RAB41
Length	155
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different set of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion. The low intrinsic GTPase activity of RAB43 is activated by USP6NL. Involved in retrograde transport from the endocytic pathway to the Golgi apparatus. Involved in the transport of Shiga toxin from early and recycling endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. Required for the structural integrity of the Golgi complex. Plays a role in the maturation of phagosomes that engulf pathogens, such as S.aureus and M.tuberculosis.
