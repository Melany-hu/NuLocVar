UniprotID	Q8N6L0
Accession	Q8N6L0;Q96MC3
EntryName	KASH5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein KASH5 (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 155) (KASH domain-containing protein 5)
GeneName	KASH5 CCDC155
Length	562
Function	As a component of the LINC (LInker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex, involved in the connection between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton. The nucleocytoplasmic interactions established by the LINC complex play an important role in the transmission of mechanical forces across the nuclear envelope and in nuclear movement and positioning. Required for telomere attachment to nuclear envelope in the prophase of meiosis (PubMed:35587281). Required for rapid telomere prophase movements implicating a SUN1/2:KASH5 LINC complex in which SUN1 and SUN2 seem to act at least partial redundantly. Required for homolog pairing during meiotic prophase in spermatocytes and probably oocytes. Essential for male and female gametogenesis (PubMed:35587281). Recruits cytoplasmic dynein to telomere attachment sites at the nuclear envelope in spermatocytes. In oocytes is involved in meiotic resumption and spindle formation.
