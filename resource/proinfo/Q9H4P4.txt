EntryName	RNF41_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase NRDP1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 41) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase NRDP1)
GeneName	RNF41 FLRF NRDP1 SBBI03
Length	317
Function	Acts as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase and regulates the degradation of target proteins. Polyubiquitinates MYD88. Negatively regulates MYD88-dependent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Can promote TRIF-dependent production of type I interferon and inhibits infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (By similarity). Promotes also activation of TBK1 and IRF3. Involved in the ubiquitination of erythropoietin (EPO) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) receptors. Thus, through maintaining basal levels of cytokine receptors, RNF41 is involved in the control of hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation into myeloerythroid lineages (By similarity). Contributes to the maintenance of steady-state ERBB3 levels by mediating its growth factor-independent degradation. Involved in the degradation of the inhibitor of apoptosis BIRC6 and thus is an important regulator of cell death by promoting apoptosis. Also acts as a PRKN modifier that accelerates its degradation, resulting in a reduction of PRKN activity, influencing the balance of intracellular redox state. The RNF41-PRKN pathway regulates autophagosome-lysosome fusion during late mitophagy. Mitophagy is a selective form of autophagy necessary for mitochondrial quality control (PubMed:24949970).
