UniprotID	Q9HBW0
Accession	Q9HBW0;O00543;O43431
EntryName	LPAR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 2 (LPA receptor 2) (LPA-2) (Lysophosphatidic acid receptor Edg-4)
GeneName	LPAR2 EDG4 LPA2
Length	348
Function	Receptor for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a mediator of diverse cellular activities. Seems to be coupled to the G(i)/G(o), G(12)/G(13), and G(q) families of heteromeric G proteins. Plays a key role in phospholipase C-beta (PLC-beta) signaling pathway. Stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) activity in a manner that is independent of RALA activation.
Subcellular Location	Cell surface; Cell membrane
