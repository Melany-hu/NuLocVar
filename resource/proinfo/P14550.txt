ProteinName	Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member A1 (EC 1.1.1.2) (EC 1.1.1.372) (EC 1.1.1.54) (Alcohol dehydrogenase [NADP(+)]) (Aldehyde reductase) (Glucuronate reductase) (EC 1.1.1.19) (Glucuronolactone reductase) (EC 1.1.1.20) (S-nitroso-CoA reductase) (ScorR) (EC 1.6.-.-)
GeneName	AKR1A1 ALDR1 ALR
Length	325
Function	Catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a wide variety of carbonyl-containing compounds to their corresponding alcohols (PubMed:10510318, PubMed:30538128). Displays enzymatic activity towards endogenous metabolites such as aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, ketones, monosaccharides and bile acids, with a preference for negatively charged substrates, such as glucuronate and succinic semialdehyde (PubMed:10510318, PubMed:30538128). Functions as a detoxifiying enzyme by reducing a range of toxic aldehydes (By similarity). Reduces methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone, which are present at elevated levels under hyperglycemic conditions and are cytotoxic (By similarity). Involved also in the detoxification of lipid-derived aldehydes like acrolein (By similarity). Plays a role in the activation of procarcinogens, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trans-dihydrodiols, and in the metabolism of various xenobiotics and drugs, including the anthracyclines doxorubicin (DOX) and daunorubicin (DAUN) (PubMed:11306097, PubMed:18276838). Also acts as an inhibitor of protein S-nitrosylation by mediating degradation of S-nitroso-coenzyme A (S-nitroso-CoA), a cofactor required to S-nitrosylate proteins (PubMed:30538128). S-nitroso-CoA reductase activity is involved in reprogramming intermediary metabolism in renal proximal tubules, notably by inhibiting protein S-nitrosylation of isoform 2 of PKM (PKM2) (By similarity). Also acts as a S-nitroso-glutathione reductase by catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of S-nitrosoglutathione (PubMed:31649033). Displays no reductase activity towards retinoids (By similarity).
