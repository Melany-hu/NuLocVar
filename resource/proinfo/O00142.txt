UniprotID	O00142
Accession	O00142;B4DGJ7;B4DZK7;B7ZAB1;E5KNQ5;E9PH08;O15238
EntryName	KITM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thymidine kinase 2, mitochondrial (EC 2.7.1.21) (2'-deoxyuridine kinase TK2) (EC 2.7.1.74) (Deoxycytidine kinase TK2) (EC 2.7.1.-) (Mt-TK)
GeneName	TK2
Length	265
Function	Phosphorylates thymidine, deoxycytidine, and deoxyuridine in the mitochondrial matrix (PubMed:11687801, PubMed:9989599). In non-replicating cells, where cytosolic dNTP synthesis is down-regulated, mtDNA synthesis depends solely on TK2 and DGUOK (PubMed:9989599). Widely used as target of antiviral and chemotherapeutic agents (PubMed:9989599).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
