UniprotID	Q0D2K3
Accession	Q0D2K3;A0JP63;Q0VGB3;Q5JRB8;Q5JRB9
EntryName	RIPP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein ripply1
GeneName	RIPPLY1
Length	151
Function	Plays a role in somitogenesis. Essential for transcriptional repression of the segmental patterning genes, thus terminating the segmentation program in the presomitic mesoderm, and also required for the maintenance of rostrocaudal polarity in somites (By similarity).
