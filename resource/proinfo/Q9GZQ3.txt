UniprotID	Q9GZQ3
Accession	Q9GZQ3;D3DWN7;Q9NVN6;Q9UHX5
EntryName	COMD5_HUMAN
ProteinName	COMM domain-containing protein 5 (Hypertension-related calcium-regulated gene protein) (HCaRG)
GeneName	COMMD5 HT002
Length	224
Function	May modulate activity of cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes (PubMed:21778237). Negatively regulates cell proliferation. Negatively regulates cell cycle G2/M phase transition probably by transactivating p21/CDKN1A through the p53/TP53-independent signaling pathway. Involved in kidney proximal tubule morphogenesis (By similarity). Down-regulates activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:15799966).
