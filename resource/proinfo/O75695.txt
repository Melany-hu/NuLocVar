UniprotID	O75695
Accession	O75695;Q86XJ7;Q9NU67
EntryName	XRP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein XRP2
GeneName	RP2
Length	350
Function	Acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) involved in trafficking between the Golgi and the ciliary membrane. Involved in localization of proteins, such as NPHP3, to the cilium membrane by inducing hydrolysis of GTP ARL3, leading to the release of UNC119 (or UNC119B). Acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for tubulin in concert with tubulin-specific chaperone C, but does not enhance tubulin heterodimerization. Acts as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor towards ADP-ribosylation factor-like proteins.
