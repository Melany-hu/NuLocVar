UniprotID	Q9NYL9
Accession	Q9NYL9;B2R6G7;Q9NT43;Q9NZR0
EntryName	TMOD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tropomodulin-3 (Ubiquitous tropomodulin) (U-Tmod)
GeneName	TMOD3
Length	352
Function	Blocks the elongation and depolymerization of the actin filaments at the pointed end. The Tmod/TM complex contributes to the formation of the short actin protofilament, which in turn defines the geometry of the membrane skeleton (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
