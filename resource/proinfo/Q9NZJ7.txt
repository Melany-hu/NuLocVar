EntryName	MTCH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial carrier homolog 1 (Presenilin-associated protein)
GeneName	MTCH1 PSAP CGI-64 UNQ1871/PRO4314
Length	389
Function	Protein insertase that mediates insertion of transmembrane proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane (PubMed:36264797). Catalyzes insertion of proteins with alpha-helical transmembrane regions, such as signal-anchored, tail-anchored and multi-pass membrane proteins (By similarity). Does not mediate insertion of beta-barrel transmembrane proteins (By similarity). May play a role in apoptosis (PubMed:12377771).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane
