UniprotID	Q8IY47
Accession	Q8IY47;A8K9T7;Q86Y62;Q9P239;Q9UFM7;Q9Y382
EntryName	KBTB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kelch repeat and BTB domain-containing protein 2 (BTB and kelch domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	KBTBD2 BKLHD1 KIAA1489 CGI-73
Length	623
Function	Substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that acts as a regulator of the insulin signaling pathway, modulating insulin sensitivity by limiting PIK3R1/p85alpha abundance in adipocytes. Targets PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), for 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation.
