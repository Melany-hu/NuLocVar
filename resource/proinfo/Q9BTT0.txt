Accession	Q9BTT0;B4E0I6;E9PEA6;Q5TB18;Q5TB20;Q8N1S4;Q8WWW9
EntryName	AN32E_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family member E (LANP-like protein) (LANP-L)
GeneName	ANP32E
Length	268
Function	Histone chaperone that specifically mediates the genome-wide removal of histone H2A.Z/H2AZ1 from the nucleosome: removes H2A.Z/H2AZ1 from its normal sites of deposition, especially from enhancer and insulator regions. Not involved in deposition of H2A.Z/H2AZ1 in the nucleosome. May stabilize the evicted H2A.Z/H2AZ1-H2B dimer, thus shifting the equilibrium towards dissociation and the off-chromatin state (PubMed:24463511). Inhibits activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Does not inhibit protein phosphatase 1. May play a role in cerebellar development and synaptogenesis.
