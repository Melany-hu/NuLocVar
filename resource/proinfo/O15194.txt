UniprotID	O15194
Accession	O15194;Q3ZTU0;Q70KI4;Q7Z5Q2
EntryName	CTDSL_HUMAN
ProteinName	CTD small phosphatase-like protein (CTDSP-like) (EC 3.1.3.16) (Carboxy-terminal domain RNA polymerase II polypeptide A small phosphatase 3) (NIF-like protein) (Nuclear LIM interactor-interacting factor 1) (NLI-interacting factor 1) (Protein YA22) (hYA22) (RBSP3) (Small C-terminal domain phosphatase 3) (SCP3) (Small CTD phosphatase 3)
GeneName	CTDSPL C3orf8 NIF1 NIFL SCP3 YA22
Length	276
Function	Recruited by REST to neuronal genes that contain RE-1 elements, leading to neuronal gene silencing in non-neuronal cells (By similarity). Preferentially catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 'Ser-5' within the tandem 7 residue repeats in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2A. Negatively regulates RNA polymerase II transcription, possibly by controlling the transition from initiation/capping to processive transcript elongation.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
