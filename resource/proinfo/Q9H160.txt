UniprotID	Q9H160
Accession	Q9H160;B6ZDS1;O95698
EntryName	ING2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inhibitor of growth protein 2 (Inhibitor of growth 1-like protein) (ING1Lp) (p32) (p33ING2)
GeneName	ING2 ING1L
Length	280
Function	Seems to be involved in p53/TP53 activation and p53/TP53-dependent apoptotic pathways, probably by enhancing acetylation of p53/TP53. Component of a mSin3A-like corepressor complex, which is probably involved in deacetylation of nucleosomal histones. ING2 activity seems to be modulated by binding to phosphoinositides (PtdInsPs).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
