UniprotID	Q8IZR5
Accession	Q8IZR5;Q52M40;Q8IZR4;Q8IZV1
EntryName	CKLF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	CKLF-like MARVEL transmembrane domain-containing protein 4 (Chemokine-like factor superfamily member 4)
GeneName	CMTM4 CKLFSF4
Length	234
Function	Acts as a backup for CMTM6 to regulate plasma membrane expression of PD-L1/CD274, an immune inhibitory ligand critical for immune tolerance to self and antitumor immunity. May protect PD-L1/CD274 from being polyubiquitinated and targeted for degradation.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
