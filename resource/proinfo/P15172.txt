UniprotID	P15172
Accession	P15172;O75321
EntryName	MYOD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myoblast determination protein 1 (Class C basic helix-loop-helix protein 1) (bHLHc1) (Myogenic factor 3) (Myf-3)
GeneName	MYOD1 BHLHC1 MYF3 MYOD
Length	320
Function	Acts as a transcriptional activator that promotes transcription of muscle-specific target genes and plays a role in muscle differentiation. Together with MYF5 and MYOG, co-occupies muscle-specific gene promoter core region during myogenesis. Induces fibroblasts to differentiate into myoblasts. Interacts with and is inhibited by the twist protein. This interaction probably involves the basic domains of both proteins (By similarity).
