EntryName	NU4M_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4 (EC 7.1.1.2) (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4)
GeneName	MT-ND4 MTND4 NADH4 ND4
Length	459
Function	Core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) which catalyzes electron transfer from NADH through the respiratory chain, using ubiquinone as an electron acceptor (PubMed:15250827, PubMed:8344246, PubMed:8644732). Essential for the catalytic activity and assembly of complex I (PubMed:15250827, PubMed:8344246, PubMed:8644732).
