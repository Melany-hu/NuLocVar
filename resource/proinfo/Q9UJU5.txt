UniprotID	Q9UJU5
Accession	Q9UJU5;Q9BYM2;Q9UDD1
EntryName	FOXD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Forkhead box protein D3 (HNF3/FH transcription factor genesis)
GeneName	FOXD3 HFH2
Length	478
Function	Binds to the consensus sequence 5'-ATTTTGTTT-3' and acts as a transcriptional repressor (PubMed:11891324). Also acts as a transcriptional activator (PubMed:11891324). Negatively regulates transcription of transcriptional repressor RHIT/ZNF205 (PubMed:22306510). Promotes development of neural crest cells from neural tube progenitors (PubMed:11891324). Restricts neural progenitor cells to the neural crest lineage while suppressing interneuron differentiation (PubMed:11891324). Required for maintenance of pluripotent cells in the pre-implantation and peri-implantation stages of embryogenesis (PubMed:11891324).
