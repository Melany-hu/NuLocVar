EntryName	RGAP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rac GTPase-activating protein 1 (Male germ cell RacGap) (MgcRacGAP) (Protein CYK4 homolog) (CYK4) (HsCYK-4)
GeneName	RACGAP1 KIAA1478 MGCRACGAP
Length	632
Function	Component of the centralspindlin complex that serves as a microtubule-dependent and Rho-mediated signaling required for the myosin contractile ring formation during the cell cycle cytokinesis. Required for proper attachment of the midbody to the cell membrane during cytokinesis. Sequentially binds to ECT2 and RAB11FIP3 which regulates cleavage furrow ingression and abscission during cytokinesis (PubMed:18511905). Plays key roles in controlling cell growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells through mechanisms other than regulating Rac GTPase activity (PubMed:10979956). Has a critical role in erythropoiesis (PubMed:34818416). Also involved in the regulation of growth-related processes in adipocytes and myoblasts. May be involved in regulating spermatogenesis and in the RACGAP1 pathway in neuronal proliferation. Shows strong GAP (GTPase activation) activity towards CDC42 and RAC1 and less towards RHOA. Essential for the early stages of embryogenesis. May play a role in regulating cortical activity through RHOA during cytokinesis. May participate in the regulation of sulfate transport in male germ cells.
