EntryName	PPT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysosomal thioesterase PPT2 (PPT-2) (EC 3.1.2.-) (S-thioesterase G14)
GeneName	PPT2
Length	302
Function	Removes thioester-linked fatty acyl groups from various substrates including S-palmitoyl-CoA. Has the highest S-thioesterase activity for the acyl groups palmitic and myristic acid followed by other short- and long-chain acyl substrates. However, because of structural constraints, is unable to remove palmitate from peptides or proteins.
Subcellular Location	Lysosome
