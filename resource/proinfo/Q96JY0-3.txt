UniprotID	Q96JY0-3
Accession	Q96JY0;B4DY43;E9JVC3;Q49AP9;Q5VZP8;Q9UIW6
EntryName	MAEL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein maelstrom homolog
GeneName	MAEL
Length	156
Function	Plays a central role during spermatogenesis by repressing transposable elements and preventing their mobilization, which is essential for the germline integrity. Acts via the piRNA metabolic process, which mediates the repression of transposable elements during meiosis by forming complexes composed of piRNAs and Piwi proteins and governs the methylation and subsequent repression of transposons. Its association with piP-bodies suggests a participation in the secondary piRNAs metabolic process. Required for the localization of germ-cell factors to the meiotic nuage (By similarity).
