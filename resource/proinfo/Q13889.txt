UniprotID	Q13889
Accession	Q13889;B2R819;B4DNZ6;Q7L0G0;Q96AT7
EntryName	TF2H3_HUMAN
ProteinName	General transcription factor IIH subunit 3 (Basic transcription factor 2 34 kDa subunit) (BTF2 p34) (General transcription factor IIH polypeptide 3) (TFIIH basal transcription factor complex p34 subunit)
GeneName	GTF2H3
Length	308
Function	Component of the general transcription and DNA repair factor IIH (TFIIH) core complex, which is involved in general and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (NER) of damaged DNA and, when complexed to CAK, in RNA transcription by RNA polymerase II. In NER, TFIIH acts by opening DNA around the lesion to allow the excision of the damaged oligonucleotide and its replacement by a new DNA fragment. In transcription, TFIIH has an essential role in transcription initiation. When the pre-initiation complex (PIC) has been established, TFIIH is required for promoter opening and promoter escape. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II by the kinase module CAK controls the initiation of transcription.
