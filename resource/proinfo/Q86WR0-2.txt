ProteinName	Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 25
GeneName	CCDC25
Length	140
Function	Transmembrane receptor that senses neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and triggers the ILK-PARVB pathway to enhance cell motility (PubMed:32528174). NETs are mainly composed of DNA fibers and are released by neutrophils to bind pathogens during inflammation (PubMed:32528174). Formation of NETs is also associated with cancer metastasis, NET-DNA acting as a chemotactic factor to attract cancer cells (PubMed:32528174). Specifically binds NETs on its extracellular region, in particular the 8-OHdG-enriched DNA present in NETs, and recruits ILK, initiating the ILK-PARVB cascade to induce cytoskeleton rearrangement and directional migration of cells (PubMed:32528174). In the context of cancer, promotes cancer metastasis by sensing NETs and promoting migration of tumor cells (PubMed:32528174).
