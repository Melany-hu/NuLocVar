UniprotID	Q9P2S5
Accession	Q9P2S5;Q5T0D6;Q9BUH7;Q9NTK7;Q9NX56
EntryName	WRP73_HUMAN
ProteinName	WD repeat-containing protein WRAP73 (WD repeat-containing protein 8) (WD repeat-containing protein antisense to TP73 gene)
GeneName	WRAP73 WDR8
Length	460
Function	The SSX2IP:WRAP73 complex is proposed to act as regulator of spindle anchoring at the mitotic centrosome. Required for the centrosomal localization of SSX2IP and normal mitotic bipolar spindle morphology (PubMed:26545777). Required for the targeting of centriole satellite proteins to centrosomes such as of PCM1, SSX2IP, CEP290 and PIBF1/CEP90. Required for ciliogenesis and involved in the removal of the CEP97:CCP110 complex from the mother centriole. Involved in ciliary vesicle formation at the mother centriole and required for the docking of vesicles to the basal body during ciliogenesis; may promote docking of RAB8A- and ARL13B-containing vesicles (PubMed:26675238).
