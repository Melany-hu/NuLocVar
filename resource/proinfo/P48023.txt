UniprotID	P48023
Accession	P48023;Q9BZP9
EntryName	TNFL6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 6 (Apoptosis antigen ligand) (APTL) (CD95 ligand) (CD95-L) (Fas antigen ligand) (Fas ligand) (FasL) (CD antigen CD178) [Cleaved into: Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 6, membrane form; Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 6, soluble form (Receptor-binding FasL ectodomain) (Soluble Fas ligand) (sFasL); ADAM10-processed FasL form (APL); FasL intracellular domain (FasL ICD) (SPPL2A-processed FasL form) (SPA)]
GeneName	FASLG APT1LG1 CD95L FASL TNFSF6
Length	281
Function	Cytokine that binds to TNFRSF6/FAS, a receptor that transduces the apoptotic signal into cells (PubMed:26334989, PubMed:9228058). Involved in cytotoxic T-cell-mediated apoptosis, natural killer cell-mediated apoptosis and in T-cell development (PubMed:7528780, PubMed:9228058, PubMed:9427603). Initiates fratricidal/suicidal activation-induced cell death (AICD) in antigen-activated T-cells contributing to the termination of immune responses (By similarity). TNFRSF6/FAS-mediated apoptosis also has a role in the induction of peripheral tolerance (By similarity). Binds to TNFRSF6B/DcR3, a decoy receptor that blocks apoptosis (PubMed:27806260).
