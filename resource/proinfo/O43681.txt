EntryName	GET3_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATPase GET3 (EC 3.6.4.-) (Arsenical pump-driving ATPase) (Arsenite-stimulated ATPase) (Guided entry of tail-anchored proteins factor 3, ATPase) (Transmembrane domain recognition complex 40 kDa ATPase subunit) (hARSA-I) (hASNA-I)
GeneName	GET3 ARSA ASNA1 TRC40
Length	348
Function	ATPase required for the post-translational delivery of tail-anchored (TA) proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:17382883). Recognizes and selectively binds the transmembrane domain of TA proteins in the cytosol. This complex then targets to the endoplasmic reticulum by membrane-bound receptors GET1/WRB and CAMLG/GET2, where the tail-anchored protein is released for insertion. This process is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. ATP binding drives the homodimer towards the closed dimer state, facilitating recognition of newly synthesized TA membrane proteins. ATP hydrolysis is required for insertion. Subsequently, the homodimer reverts towards the open dimer state, lowering its affinity for the GET1-CAMLG receptor, and returning it to the cytosol to initiate a new round of targeting. May be involved in insulin signaling.
