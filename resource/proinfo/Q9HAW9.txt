EntryName	UD18_HUMAN
ProteinName	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A8 (UGT1A8) (EC 2.4.1.17) (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-8) (UDPGT 1-8) (UGT1*8) (UGT1-08) (UGT1.8) (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-H) (UGT-1H) (UGT1H)
GeneName	UGT1A8 GNT1 UGT1
Length	530
Function	UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) that catalyzes phase II biotransformation reactions in which lipophilic substrates are conjugated with glucuronic acid to increase the metabolite's water solubility, thereby facilitating excretion into either the urine or bile (PubMed:15472229, PubMed:16595710, PubMed:18004212, PubMed:18052087, PubMed:18674515, PubMed:18719240, PubMed:19545173, PubMed:23288867, PubMed:21422672). Essential for the elimination and detoxification of drugs, xenobiotics and endogenous compounds (PubMed:15472229, PubMed:16595710, PubMed:23288867). Catalyzes the glucuronidation of endogenous steroid hormones such as androgens and estrogens (PubMed:15472229, PubMed:16595710, PubMed:18719240, PubMed:23288867). Produces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) diglucuronide from the DHT after two subsequent glucoronidation steps (PubMed:16595710). Involved in the glucuronidation of the phytochemical ferulic acid at the phenolic or the carboxylic acid group (PubMed:21422672). Also catalyzes the glucuronidation of the isoflavones genistein, daidzein, glycitein, formononetin, biochanin A and prunetin, which are phytoestrogens with anticancer and cardiovascular properties (PubMed:18052087, PubMed:19545173). Involved in the glucuronidation of the AGTR1 angiotensin receptor antagonist caderastan, a drug which can inhibit the effect of angiotensin II (PubMed:18674515). Also metabolizes mycophenolate, an immunosuppressive agent (PubMed:15470161, PubMed:18004212).
