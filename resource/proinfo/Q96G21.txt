EntryName	IMP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein protein IMP4 (U3 snoRNP protein IMP4) (Brix domain-containing protein 4)
GeneName	IMP4 BXDC4
Length	291
Function	Component of the 60-80S U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (U3 snoRNP). Required for the early cleavages during pre-18S ribosomal RNA processing (PubMed:12655004). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
