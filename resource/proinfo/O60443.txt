UniprotID	O60443
Accession	O60443;A4D156;B2RAX9;B3KT05;O14590;Q08AQ8;Q9UBV3
EntryName	GSDME_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gasdermin-E (Inversely correlated with estrogen receptor expression 1) (ICERE-1) (Non-syndromic hearing impairment protein 5) [Cleaved into: Gasdermin-E, N-terminal (GSDME-NT); Gasdermin-E, C-terminal (GSDME-CT)]
GeneName	GSDME DFNA5 ICERE1
Length	496
Function	Precursor of a pore-forming protein that converts non-inflammatory apoptosis to pyroptosis (PubMed:27281216, PubMed:28459430, PubMed:33852854, PubMed:35594856, PubMed:36607699). This form constitutes the precursor of the pore-forming protein: upon cleavage, the released N-terminal moiety (Gasdermin-E, N-terminal) binds to membranes and forms pores, triggering pyroptosis (PubMed:28459430).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytosol
