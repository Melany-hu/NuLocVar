UniprotID	Q969P5
Accession	Q969P5;A4KYM0
EntryName	FBX32_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-box only protein 32 (Atrogin-1) (Muscle atrophy F-box protein) (MAFbx)
GeneName	FBXO32
Length	355
Function	Substrate recognition component of a SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Probably recognizes and binds to phosphorylated target proteins during skeletal muscle atrophy. Recognizes TERF1.
