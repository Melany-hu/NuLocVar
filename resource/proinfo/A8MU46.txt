UniprotID	A8MU46
Accession	A8MU46;E9PPJ3
EntryName	SMTL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Smoothelin-like protein 1
GeneName	SMTNL1
Length	494
Function	Plays a role in the regulation of contractile properties of both striated and smooth muscles. When unphosphorylated, may inhibit myosin dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation at Ser-299 reduces this inhibitory activity (By similarity).
