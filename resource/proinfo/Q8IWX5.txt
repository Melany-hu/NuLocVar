EntryName	SGPP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 2 (SPPase2) (Spp2) (hSPP2) (EC 3.1.3.-) (Sphingosine-1-phosphatase 2)
GeneName	SGPP2
Length	399
Function	Has specific phosphohydrolase activity towards sphingoid base 1-phosphates. Has high phosphohydrolase activity against dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in vitro (PubMed:12411432). Sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase activity is needed for efficient recycling of sphingosine into the sphingolipid synthesis pathway (By similarity). May play a role in attenuating intracellular sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling. May play a role in pro-inflammatory signaling (PubMed:17113265). Plays a role in the regulation of pancreatic islet beta-cell endoplasmic reticulum stress and proliferation (By similarity).
