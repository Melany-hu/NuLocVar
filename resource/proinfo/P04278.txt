EntryName	SHBG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) (Sex steroid-binding protein) (SBP) (Testis-specific androgen-binding protein) (ABP) (Testosterone-estradiol-binding globulin) (TeBG) (Testosterone-estrogen-binding globulin)
GeneName	SHBG
Length	402
Function	Functions as an androgen transport protein, but may also be involved in receptor mediated processes. Each dimer binds one molecule of steroid. Specific for 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, and 17-beta-estradiol. Regulates the plasma metabolic clearance rate of steroid hormones by controlling their plasma concentration.
