UniprotID	P01215
Accession	P01215
EntryName	GLHA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycoprotein hormones alpha chain (Anterior pituitary glycoprotein hormones common subunit alpha) (Choriogonadotropin alpha chain) (Chorionic gonadotrophin subunit alpha) (CG-alpha) (Follicle-stimulating hormone alpha chain) (FSH-alpha) (Follitropin alpha chain) (Luteinizing hormone alpha chain) (LSH-alpha) (Lutropin alpha chain) (Thyroid-stimulating hormone alpha chain) (TSH-alpha) (Thyrotropin alpha chain)
GeneName	CGA
Length	116
Function	Shared alpha chain of the active heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones thyrotropin/thyroid stimulating hormone/TSH, lutropin/luteinizing hormone/LH, follitropin/follicle stimulating hormone/FSH and choriogonadotropin/CG. These hormones bind specific receptors on target cells that in turn activate downstream signaling pathways.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
