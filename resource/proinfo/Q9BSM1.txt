UniprotID	Q9BSM1
Accession	Q9BSM1;Q7Z506
EntryName	PCGF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polycomb group RING finger protein 1 (Nervous system Polycomb-1) (NSPc1) (RING finger protein 68)
GeneName	PCGF1 NSPC1 RNF68
Length	259
Function	Component of the Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein BCOR complex, a complex required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of some genes, such as BCL6 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, CDKN1A. Transcriptional repressor that may be targeted to the DNA by BCL6; this transcription repressor activity may be related to PKC signaling pathway. Represses CDKN1A expression by binding to its promoter, and this repression is dependent on the retinoic acid response element (RARE element). Promotes cell cycle progression and enhances cell proliferation as well. May have a positive role in tumor cell growth by down-regulating CDKN1A. Component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones; it mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119', rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility (PubMed:26151332). Within the PRC1-like complex, regulates RNF2 ubiquitin ligase activity (PubMed:26151332). Regulates the expression of DPPA4 and NANOG in the NT2 embryonic carcinoma cells (PubMed:26687479).
