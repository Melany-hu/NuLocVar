EntryName	PI51B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type-1 beta (PIP5K1-beta) (PtdIns(4)P-5-kinase 1 beta) (EC 2.7.1.68) (Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type I beta) (PIP5KIbeta) (Protein STM-7) (Type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase beta)
GeneName	PIP5K1B STM7
Length	540
Function	Catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P/PI4P) to form phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2/PIP2), a lipid second messenger that regulates several cellular processes such as signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell adhesion, and cell motility (By similarity). PtdIns(4,5)P2 can directly act as a second messenger or can be utilized as a precursor to generate other second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG) or phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/PIP3) (By similarity). Mediates RAC1-dependent reorganization of actin filaments. Contributes to the activation of phospholipase PLD2. Together with PIP5K1A, is required, after stimulation by G-protein coupled receptors, for the synthesis of IP3 that will induce stable platelet adhesion (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Cell membrane; Endomembrane system
