UniprotID	P31153
Accession	P31153;A8K511;B4DN45;D6W5L1;Q53SP5
EntryName	METK2_HUMAN
ProteinName	S-adenosylmethionine synthase isoform type-2 (AdoMet synthase 2) (EC 2.5.1.6) (Methionine adenosyltransferase 2) (MAT 2) (Methionine adenosyltransferase II) (MAT-II)
GeneName	MAT2A AMS2 MATA2
Length	395
Function	Catalyzes the formation of S-adenosylmethionine from methionine and ATP. The reaction comprises two steps that are both catalyzed by the same enzyme: formation of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and triphosphate, and subsequent hydrolysis of the triphosphate.
