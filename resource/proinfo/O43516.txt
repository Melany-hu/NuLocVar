UniprotID	O43516
Accession	O43516;B8ZZM1;D3DPE4;Q15220;Q53TA9;Q6MZU9;Q9BU37;Q9UNP1
EntryName	WIPF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	WAS/WASL-interacting protein family member 1 (Protein PRPL-2) (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-interacting protein) (WASP-interacting protein)
GeneName	WIPF1 WASPIP WIP
Length	503
Function	Plays a role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Contributes with NCK1 and GRB2 in the recruitment and activation of WASL. May participate in regulating the subcellular localization of WASL, resulting in the disassembly of stress fibers in favor of filopodia formation. Plays a role in the formation of cell ruffles (By similarity). Plays an important role in the intracellular motility of vaccinia virus by functioning as an adapter for recruiting WASL to vaccinia virus.
