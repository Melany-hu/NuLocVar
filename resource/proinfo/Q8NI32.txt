Function	Likely acts as a modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) activity (PubMed:26586467, PubMed:34631692). In vitro acts on nAChRs in a subtype- and stoichiometry-dependent manner (PubMed:26586467). Modulates specifically alpha-3(3):beta-4(2) nAChRs by enhancing the sensitivity to ACh, decreasing ACh-induced maximal current response and increasing the rate of desensitization to ACh; has no effect on alpha-7 homomeric nAChRs; modulates alpha-3(2):alpha-5:beta-4(2) nAChRs in the context of CHRNA5/alpha-5 variant Asn-398 but not its wild-type sequence (PubMed:26586467). However, according to another report in vitro it can weakly inhibits alpha-7 nAChRs (PubMed:34631692).
