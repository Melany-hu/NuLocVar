EntryName	S39A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc transporter ZIP1 (Solute carrier family 39 member 1) (Zinc-iron-regulated transporter-like) (Zrt- and Irt-like protein 1) (ZIP-1) (hZIP1)
GeneName	SLC39A1 IRT1 ZIP1 ZIRTL CGI-08 CGI-71
Length	324
Function	Transporter for the divalent cation Zn(2+). Mediates the influx of Zn(2+) into cells from extracellular space (PubMed:11301334, PubMed:12888280, PubMed:16844077). Functions as the major importer of zinc from circulating blood plasma into prostate cells (PubMed:12888280).
