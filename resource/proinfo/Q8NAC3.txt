EntryName	I17RC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-17 receptor C (IL-17 receptor C) (IL-17RC) (Interleukin-17 receptor homolog) (IL17Rhom) (Interleukin-17 receptor-like protein) (IL-17RL) (ZcytoR14)
GeneName	IL17RC UNQ6118/PRO20040/PRO38901
Length	791
Function	Receptor for IL17A and IL17F, major effector cytokines of innate and adaptive immune system involved in antimicrobial host defense and maintenance of tissue integrity (By similarity). Receptor for IL17A and IL17F, major effector cytokines of innate and adaptive immune system involved in antimicrobial host defense and maintenance of tissue integrity. Receptor for IL17A and IL17F homodimers as part of a heterodimeric complex with IL17RA (PubMed:16785495). Receptor for the heterodimer formed by IL17A and IL17B as part of a heterodimeric complex with IL17RA (PubMed:18684971). Has also been shown to be the cognate receptor for IL17F and to bind IL17A with high affinity without the need for IL17RA (PubMed:17911633). Upon binding of IL17F homodimer triggers downstream activation of TRAF6 and NF-kappa-B signaling pathway (PubMed:16785495, PubMed:32187518). Induces transcriptional activation of IL33, a potent cytokine that stimulates group 2 innate lymphoid cells and adaptive T-helper 2 cells involved in pulmonary allergic response to fungi (By similarity). Promotes sympathetic innervation of peripheral organs by coordinating the communication between gamma-delta T cells and parenchymal cells. Stimulates sympathetic innervation of thermogenic adipose tissue by driving TGFB1 expression (By similarity). Binding of IL17A-IL17F to IL17RA-IL17RC heterodimeric receptor complex triggers homotypic interaction of IL17RA and IL17RC chains with TRAF3IP2 adapter through SEFIR domains. This leads to downstream TRAF6-mediated activation of NF-kappa-B and MAPkinase pathways ultimately resulting in transcriptional activation of cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial peptides and matrix metalloproteinases, with potential strong immune inflammation (PubMed:17911633, PubMed:18684971). Primarily induces neutrophil activation and recruitment at infection and inflammatory sites (By similarity). Stimulates the production of antimicrobial beta-defensins DEFB1, DEFB103A, and DEFB104A by mucosal epithelial cells, limiting the entry of microbes through the epithelial barriers (By similarity).
