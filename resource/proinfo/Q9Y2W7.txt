UniprotID	Q9Y2W7
Accession	Q9Y2W7;H7BY46;Q3YAC3;Q3YAC4;Q53TJ5;Q96T40;Q9UJ84;Q9UJ85
EntryName	CSEN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calsenilin (A-type potassium channel modulatory protein 3) (DRE-antagonist modulator) (DREAM) (Kv channel-interacting protein 3) (KChIP3)
GeneName	KCNIP3 CSEN DREAM KCHIP3
Length	256
Function	Calcium-dependent transcriptional repressor that binds to the DRE element of genes including PDYN and FOS. Affinity for DNA is reduced upon binding to calcium and enhanced by binding to magnesium. Seems to be involved in nociception (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cell membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum; Golgi apparatus; Nucleus
