UniprotID	Q5M7Z0
Accession	Q5M7Z0;Q8N7D0;Q96IZ9;Q9Y686
EntryName	RNFT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNFT1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Protein PTD016) (RING finger and transmembrane domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	RNFT1 PTD016
Length	435
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that acts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which targets misfolded proteins that accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Protects cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
