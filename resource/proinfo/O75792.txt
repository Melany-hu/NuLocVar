UniprotID	O75792
Accession	O75792;B2RCY1;Q96F11
EntryName	RNH2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease H2 subunit A (RNase H2 subunit A) (EC 3.1.26.4) (Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 4 protein) (AGS4) (RNase H(35)) (Ribonuclease HI large subunit) (RNase HI large subunit) (Ribonuclease HI subunit A)
GeneName	RNASEH2A RNASEHI RNHIA
Length	299
Function	Catalytic subunit of RNase HII, an endonuclease that specifically degrades the RNA of RNA:DNA hybrids. Participates in DNA replication, possibly by mediating the removal of lagging-strand Okazaki fragment RNA primers during DNA replication. Mediates the excision of single ribonucleotides from DNA:RNA duplexes.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
