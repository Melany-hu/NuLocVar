EntryName	CXA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gap junction alpha-1 protein (Connexin-43) (Cx43) (Gap junction 43 kDa heart protein)
GeneName	GJA1 GJAL
Length	382
Function	Gap junction protein that acts as a regulator of bladder capacity. A gap junction consists of a cluster of closely packed pairs of transmembrane channels, the connexons, through which materials of low MW diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell. May play a critical role in the physiology of hearing by participating in the recycling of potassium to the cochlear endolymph. Negative regulator of bladder functional capacity: acts by enhancing intercellular electrical and chemical transmission, thus sensitizing bladder muscles to cholinergic neural stimuli and causing them to contract (By similarity). May play a role in cell growth inhibition through the regulation of NOV expression and localization. Plays an essential role in gap junction communication in the ventricles (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell junction; Gap junction; Endoplasmic reticulum
