EntryName	LNP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Endoplasmic reticulum junction formation protein lunapark (ER junction formation factor lunapark)
GeneName	LNPK KIAA1715 LNP
Length	428
Function	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-shaping membrane protein that plays a role in determining ER morphology (PubMed:30032983). Involved in the stabilization of nascent three-way ER tubular junctions within the ER network (PubMed:24223779, PubMed:25404289, PubMed:25548161, PubMed:27619977). May also play a role as a curvature-stabilizing protein within the three-way ER tubular junction network (PubMed:25404289). May be involved in limb development (By similarity). Is involved in central nervous system development (PubMed:30032983).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
