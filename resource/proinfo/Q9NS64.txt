UniprotID	Q9NS64
Accession	Q9NS64;B2R4V1
EntryName	RPRM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein reprimo
GeneName	RPRM
Length	109
Function	May be involved in the regulation of p53-dependent G2 arrest of the cell cycle. Seems to induce cell cycle arrest by inhibiting CDK1 activity and nuclear translocation of the CDC2 cyclin B1 complex (By similarity).
