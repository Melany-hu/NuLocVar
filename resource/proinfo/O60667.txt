EntryName	FCMR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Immunoglobulin mu Fc receptor (IgM FcR) (Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 3) (FAIM3) (Regulator of Fas-induced apoptosis Toso)
GeneName	FCMR FAIM3 TOSO
Length	390
Function	High-affinity Fc receptor for immunoglobulin M (IgM), both secreted and membrane-bound IgM (PubMed:19858324, PubMed:22675200, PubMed:36949194, PubMed:37095205). Primarily regulates IgM transport and homeostasis. In lymphoid cells, enables exocytosis of membrane-bound IgM on the plasma membrane as well as endocytosis of IgM-antigen complexes toward lysosomes for degradation. In mucosal epithelium, mediates retrotranscytosis of antigen-IgM complexes across mucosal M cells toward antigen-presenting cells in mucosal lymphoid tissues (PubMed:21908732, PubMed:28230186). Triggers costimulatory signaling and mediates most of IgM effector functions involved in B cell development and primary immune response to infection. Likely limits tonic IgM BCR signaling to self-antigens for proper negative selection of autoreactive B cells in the bone marrow and for the maintenance of regulatory B cell pool in peripheral lymphoid organs. Mediates antibody responses to T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antigens and promotes induction of an efficient neutralizing IgG response. Engages in cross-talk with antigen-receptor signaling via the non-canonical NF-kappa-B, MAP kinases and calcium signaling pathways (PubMed:19858324, PubMed:22675200, PubMed:25601920, PubMed:30840890).
