UniprotID	Q8WWM9
Accession	Q8WWM9;Q541Y7;Q8N2X5
EntryName	CYGB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytoglobin (Histoglobin) (HGb) (Nitric oxygen dioxygenase CYGB) (NOD) (EC 1.14.12.-) (Nitrite reductase CYGB) (EC 1.7.-.-) (Pseudoperoxidase CYGB) (EC 1.11.1.-) (Stellate cell activation-associated protein) (Superoxide dismutase CYGB) (EC 1.15.1.1)
GeneName	CYGB STAP
Length	190
Function	Probable multifunctional globin with a hexacoordinated heme iron required for the catalysis of various reactions depending on redox condition of the cell as well as oxygen availability (PubMed:11893755, PubMed:12359339, PubMed:15165856, PubMed:19147491, PubMed:20511233, PubMed:28393874, PubMed:28671819, PubMed:29128400, PubMed:33576020, PubMed:34930834). Has a nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD) activity and is most probably involved in cell-mediated and oxygen-dependent nitric oxide consumption (PubMed:19147491, PubMed:20511233, PubMed:28393874, PubMed:28671819). By scavenging this second messenger may regulate several biological processes including endothelium-mediated vasodilation and vascular tone (PubMed:19147491, PubMed:28393874). Under normoxic conditions functions as a nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD) but under hypoxic conditions the globin may switch its function to that of a nitrite (NO2) reductase (NiR), generating nitric oxide (PubMed:29128400). Could also have peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities, detoxifying reactive oxygen species and protecting cells against oxidative stress (PubMed:12359339, PubMed:33576020, PubMed:34930834). Also binds dioxygen with low affinity and could function as an oxygen sensor but has probably no function as a respiratory oxygen carrier (PubMed:11893755, PubMed:15299006, PubMed:20553503).
