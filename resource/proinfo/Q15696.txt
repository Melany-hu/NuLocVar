UniprotID	Q15696
Accession	Q15696;Q14D69
EntryName	U2AFM_HUMAN
ProteinName	U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor 35 kDa subunit-related protein 2 (CCCH type zinc finger, RNA-binding motif and serine/arginine rich protein 2) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-20) (U2(RNU2) small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1-like 2) (U2AF35-related protein) (URP)
GeneName	ZRSR2 U2AF1-RS2 U2AF1L2 U2AF1RS2 URP
Length	482
Function	Pre-mRNA-binding protein required for splicing of both U2- and U12-type introns. Selectively interacts with the 3'-splice site of U2- and U12-type pre-mRNAs and promotes different steps in U2 and U12 intron splicing. Recruited to U12 pre-mRNAs in an ATP-dependent manner and is required for assembly of the pre-spliceosome, a precursor to other spliceosomal complexes. For U2-type introns, it is selectively and specifically required for the second step of splicing.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
