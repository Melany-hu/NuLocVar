UniprotID	Q9NZG7
Accession	Q9NZG7
EntryName	NINJ2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ninjurin-2 (Nerve injury-induced protein 2)
GeneName	NINJ2
Length	142
Function	Its role in unclear (PubMed:33472215, PubMed:38614101, PubMed:39667936). In contrast to NINJ1 paralog, does not mediate plasma membrane rupture (cytolysis) downstream of necroptotic and pyroptotic programmed cell death (PubMed:33472215, PubMed:38614101, PubMed:39667936). While it is able to oligomerize and form filaments, filaments are curved toward the intracellular space, preventing circularization to mediate plasma membrane rupture (PubMed:39667936). May act as a homophilic transmembrane adhesion molecule involved in nerve regeneration (PubMed:10627596). Promotes axonal growth (PubMed:10627596).
