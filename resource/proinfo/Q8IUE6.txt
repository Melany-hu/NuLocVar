UniprotID	Q8IUE6
Accession	Q8IUE6
EntryName	H2A2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A type 2-B (H2A-clustered histone 21)
GeneName	H2AC21 HIST2H2AB
Length	130
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
