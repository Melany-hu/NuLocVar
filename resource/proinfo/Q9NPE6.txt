UniprotID	Q9NPE6
Accession	Q9NPE6;O43648
EntryName	SPAG4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sperm-associated antigen 4 protein (Outer dense fiber-associated protein SPAG4) (SUN domain-containing protein 4)
GeneName	SPAG4 SUN4
Length	437
Function	Involved in spermatogenesis. Required for sperm head formation but not required to establish and maintain general polarity of the sperm head. Required for anchoring and organization of the manchette. Required for targeting of SUN3 and probably SYNE1 through a probable SUN1:SYNE3 LINC complex to the nuclear envelope and involved in accurate posterior sperm head localization of the complex. May anchor SUN3 the nuclear envelope. Involved in maintenance of the nuclear envelope integrity. May assist the organization and assembly of outer dense fibers (ODFs), a specific structure of the sperm tail.
