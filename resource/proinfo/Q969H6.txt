Accession	Q969H6;A6NL80;Q53FS5;Q9Y2Q6
EntryName	POP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease P/MRP protein subunit POP5 (hPop5)
GeneName	POP5 AD-008 HSPC004 x0003
Length	163
Function	Component of ribonuclease P, a protein complex that generates mature tRNA molecules by cleaving their 5'-ends (PubMed:11413139, PubMed:30454648). Also a component of the MRP ribonuclease complex, which cleaves pre-rRNA sequences (PubMed:28115465).
