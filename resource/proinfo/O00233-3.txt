UniprotID	O00233-3
Accession	O00233;B2RD35;G3V1Q6;Q9BQ42
EntryName	PSMD9_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 9 (26S proteasome regulatory subunit p27)
GeneName	PSMD9
Length	118
Function	Acts as a chaperone during the assembly of the 26S proteasome, specifically of the base subcomplex of the PA700/19S regulatory complex (RC). During the base subcomplex assembly is part of an intermediate PSMD9:PSMC6:PSMC3 module, also known as modulator trimer complex; PSMD9 is released during the further base assembly process.
