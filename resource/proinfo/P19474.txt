UniprotID	P19474
Accession	P19474;Q5XPV5;Q96RF8
EntryName	RO52_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM21 (EC 2.3.2.27) (52 kDa Ro protein) (52 kDa ribonucleoprotein autoantigen Ro/SS-A) (RING finger protein 81) (Ro(SS-A)) (Sjoegren syndrome type A antigen) (SS-A) (Tripartite motif-containing protein 21)
GeneName	TRIM21 RNF81 RO52 SSA1
Length	475
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase whose activity is dependent on E2 enzymes, UBE2D1, UBE2D2, UBE2E1 and UBE2E2 (PubMed:16297862, PubMed:16316627, PubMed:16472766, PubMed:16880511, PubMed:18022694, PubMed:18361920, PubMed:18641315, PubMed:18845142, PubMed:19675099, PubMed:26347139). Forms a ubiquitin ligase complex in cooperation with the E2 UBE2D2 that is used not only for the ubiquitination of USP4 and IKBKB but also for its self-ubiquitination (PubMed:16880511, PubMed:19675099). Component of cullin-RING-based SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes such as SCF(SKP2)-like complexes (PubMed:16880511). A TRIM21-containing SCF(SKP2)-like complex is shown to mediate ubiquitination of CDKN1B ('Thr-187' phosphorylated-form), thereby promoting its degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:16880511). Monoubiquitinates IKBKB that will negatively regulates Tax-induced NF-kappa-B signaling (PubMed:19675099). Negatively regulates IFN-beta production post-pathogen recognition by catalyzing polyubiquitin-mediated degradation of IRF3 (PubMed:18641315). Mediates the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of IgG1 heavy chain, which is linked to the VCP-mediated ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (PubMed:18022694). Promotes IRF8 ubiquitination, which enhanced the ability of IRF8 to stimulate cytokine genes transcription in macrophages (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of the cell cycle progression (PubMed:16880511). Enhances the decapping activity of DCP2 (PubMed:18361920). Exists as a ribonucleoprotein particle present in all mammalian cells studied and composed of a single polypeptide and one of four small RNA molecules (PubMed:1985094, PubMed:8666824). At least two isoforms are present in nucleated and red blood cells, and tissue specific differences in RO/SSA proteins have been identified (PubMed:8666824). The common feature of these proteins is their ability to bind HY RNAs.2 (PubMed:8666824). Involved in the regulation of innate immunity and the inflammatory response in response to IFNG/IFN-gamma (PubMed:26347139). Organizes autophagic machinery by serving as a platform for the assembly of ULK1, Beclin 1/BECN1 and ATG8 family members and recognizes specific autophagy targets, thus coordinating target recognition with assembly of the autophagic apparatus and initiation of autophagy (PubMed:26347139). Also regulates autophagy through FIP200/RB1CC1 ubiquitination and subsequent decreased protein stability (PubMed:36359729). Represses the innate antiviral response by facilitating the formation of the NMI-IFI35 complex through 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of NMI (PubMed:26342464). During viral infection, promotes cell pyroptosis by mediating 'Lys-6'-linked ubiquitination of ISG12a/IFI27, facilitating its translocation into the mitochondria and subsequent CASP3 activation (PubMed:36426955). When up-regulated through the IFN/JAK/STAT signaling pathway, promotes 'Lys-27'-linked ubiquitination of MAVS, leading to the recruitment of TBK1 and up-regulation of innate immunity (PubMed:29743353). Mediates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of G3BP1 in response to heat shock, leading to stress granule disassembly (PubMed:36692217).
