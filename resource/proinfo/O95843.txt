UniprotID	O95843
Accession	O95843;O95844;Q9UNM0
EntryName	GUC1C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanylyl cyclase-activating protein 3 (GCAP 3) (Guanylate cyclase activator 1C)
GeneName	GUCA1C GCAP3
Length	209
Function	Stimulates guanylyl cyclase 1 (GC1) and GC2 when free calcium ions concentration is low and inhibits guanylyl cyclases when free calcium ions concentration is elevated. This Ca(2+)-sensitive regulation of guanylyl cyclase (GC) is a key event in recovery of the dark state of rod photoreceptors following light exposure.
