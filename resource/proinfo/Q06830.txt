UniprotID	Q06830
Accession	Q06830;B5BU26;D3DPZ8;P35703;Q2V576;Q5T154;Q5T155
EntryName	PRDX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxiredoxin-1 (EC 1.11.1.24) (Natural killer cell-enhancing factor A) (NKEF-A) (Proliferation-associated gene protein) (PAG) (Thioredoxin peroxidase 2) (Thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase 2) (Thioredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxin 1)
GeneName	PRDX1 PAGA PAGB TDPX2
Length	199
Function	Thiol-specific peroxidase that catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water and alcohols, respectively. Plays a role in cell protection against oxidative stress by detoxifying peroxides and as sensor of hydrogen peroxide-mediated signaling events. Might participate in the signaling cascades of growth factors and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by regulating the intracellular concentrations of H(2)O(2) (PubMed:9497357). Reduces an intramolecular disulfide bond in GDPD5 that gates the ability to GDPD5 to drive postmitotic motor neuron differentiation (By similarity).
