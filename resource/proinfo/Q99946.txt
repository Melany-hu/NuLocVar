UniprotID	Q99946
Accession	Q99946;A6ND08;A6ND40;B0S869;Q5SSW4;Q5SSX7;Q5STI1;Q96DW3;Q96NQ8
EntryName	PRRT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proline-rich transmembrane protein 1 (Dispanin subfamily D member 1) (DSPD1) (Synapse differentiation-induced protein 4) (SynDIG4)
GeneName	PRRT1 C6orf31 NG5
Length	306
Function	Required to maintain a pool of extrasynaptic AMPA-regulated glutamate receptors (AMPAR) which is necessary for synapse development and function. Regulates basal AMPAR function and synaptic transmission during development but is dispensable at mature hippocampal synapses. Plays a role in regulating basal phosphorylation levels of glutamate receptor GRIA1 and promotes GRIA1 and GRIA2 cell surface expression.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Synapse
