UniprotID	Q16543
Accession	Q16543;Q53YA2
EntryName	CDC37_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hsp90 co-chaperone Cdc37 (Hsp90 chaperone protein kinase-targeting subunit) (p50Cdc37) [Cleaved into: Hsp90 co-chaperone Cdc37, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	CDC37 CDC37A
Length	378
Function	Co-chaperone that binds to numerous kinases and promotes their interaction with the Hsp90 complex, resulting in stabilization and promotion of their activity (PubMed:8666233). Inhibits HSP90AA1 ATPase activity (PubMed:23569206).
