UniprotID	Q96LR2
Accession	Q96LR2
EntryName	LURA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine rich adaptor protein 1 (Leucine repeat adapter protein 35A)
GeneName	LURAP1 C1orf190 LRAP35A LRP35A
Length	239
Function	Acts as an activator of the canonical NF-kappa-B pathway and drive the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Promotes the antigen (Ag)-presenting and priming function of dendritic cells via the canonical NF-kappa-B pathway (PubMed:21048106). In concert with MYO18A and CDC42BPA/CDC42BPB, is involved in modulating lamellar actomyosin retrograde flow that is crucial to cell protrusion and migration. Activates CDC42BPA/CDC42BPB and targets it to actomyosin through its interaction with MYO18A, leading to MYL9/MLC2 phosphorylation and MYH9/MYH10-dependent actomyosin assembly in the lamella (By similarity).
