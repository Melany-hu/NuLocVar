UniprotID	O14966
Accession	O14966;B4E1K3;C9JE77
EntryName	RAB7L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-7L1 (Rab-7-like protein 1) (Ras-related protein Rab-29)
GeneName	RAB29 RAB7L1
Length	203
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators in vesicle trafficking (PubMed:24788816). Essential for maintaining the integrity of the endosome-trans-Golgi network structure (By similarity). Together with LRRK2, plays a role in the retrograde trafficking pathway for recycling proteins, such as mannose 6 phosphate receptor (M6PR), between lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus in a retromer-dependent manner (PubMed:24788816). Recruits LRRK2 to the Golgi complex and stimulates LRRK2 kinase activity (PubMed:29212815, PubMed:38127736). Stimulates phosphorylation of RAB10 'Thr-73' by LRRK2 (PubMed:38127736). Regulates neuronal process morphology in the intact central nervous system (CNS) (By similarity). May play a role in the formation of typhoid toxin transport intermediates during Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S.typhi) epithelial cell infection (PubMed:22042847).
