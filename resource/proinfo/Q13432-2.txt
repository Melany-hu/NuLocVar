UniprotID	Q13432-2
Accession	Q13432;A8K8G4;F1T095;O95126
EntryName	U119A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein unc-119 homolog A (Retinal protein 4) (hRG4)
GeneName	UNC119 RG4
Length	220
Function	Involved in synaptic functions in photoreceptor cells, the signal transduction in immune cells as a Src family kinase activator, endosome recycling, the uptake of bacteria and endocytosis, protein trafficking in sensory neurons and as lipid-binding chaperone with specificity for a diverse subset of myristoylated proteins. Specifically binds the myristoyl moiety of a subset of N-terminally myristoylated proteins and is required for their localization. Binds myristoylated GNAT1 and is required for G-protein localization and trafficking in sensory neurons. Probably plays a role in trafficking proteins in photoreceptor cells. Plays important roles in mediating Src family kinase signals for the completion of cytokinesis via RAB11A.
