UniprotID	O00300
Accession	O00300;B2R9A8;O60236;Q53FX6;Q9UHP4
EntryName	TR11B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 11B (Osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor) (Osteoprotegerin)
GeneName	TNFRSF11B OCIF OPG
Length	401
Function	Acts as a decoy receptor for TNFSF11/RANKL and thereby neutralizes its function in osteoclastogenesis. Inhibits the activation of osteoclasts and promotes osteoclast apoptosis in vitro. Bone homeostasis seems to depend on the local ratio between TNFSF11 and TNFRSF11B. May also play a role in preventing arterial calcification. May act as decoy receptor for TNFSF10/TRAIL and protect against apoptosis. TNFSF10/TRAIL binding blocks the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis.
