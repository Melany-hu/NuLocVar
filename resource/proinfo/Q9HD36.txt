UniprotID	Q9HD36
Accession	Q9HD36;Q3SX80;Q52LQ9;Q8TCS9
EntryName	B2L10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bcl-2-like protein 10 (Bcl2-L-10) (Anti-apoptotic protein Boo) (Anti-apoptotic protein NrH) (Apoptosis regulator Bcl-B)
GeneName	BCL2L10 BCL-B BCLB BOO DIVA
Length	204
Function	Promotes cell survival by suppressing apoptosis induced by BAX but not BAK (PubMed:11278245, PubMed:11689480). Increases binding of AHCYL1/IRBIT to ITPR1 (PubMed:27995898). Reduces ITPR1-mediated calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum cooperatively with AHCYL1/IRBIT under normal cellular conditions (PubMed:27995898). Under apoptotic stress conditions, dissociates from ITPR1 and is displaced from mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes, leading to increased Ca(2+) transfer to mitochondria which promotes apoptosis (PubMed:27995898). Required for the correct formation of the microtubule organizing center during oocyte cell division, potentially via regulation of protein abundance and localization of other microtubule organizing center components such as AURKA and TPX2 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion; Nucleus membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Spindle
