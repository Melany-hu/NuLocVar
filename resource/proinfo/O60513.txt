ProteinName	Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 4 (Beta-1,4-GalTase 4) (Beta4Gal-T4) (b4Gal-T4) (EC 2.4.1.-) (Beta-N-acetylglucosaminyl-glycolipid beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase) (Lactotriaosylceramide beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase) (EC 2.4.1.275) (N-acetyllactosamine synthase) (EC 2.4.1.90) (Nal synthase) (UDP-Gal:beta-GlcNAc beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 4) (UDP-galactose:beta-N-acetylglucosamine beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 4)
GeneName	B4GALT4 UNQ552/PRO1109
Length	344
Function	Galactose (Gal) transferase involved in the synthesis of terminal N-acetyllactosamine (LacNac) unit present on glycan chains of glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids (PubMed:12511560, PubMed:17690104, PubMed:32827291, PubMed:9792633). Catalyzes the transfer of Gal residue via a beta1->4 linkage from UDP-Gal to the non-reducing terminal N-acetyl glucosamine 6-O-sulfate (6-O-sulfoGlcNAc) in the linearly growing chain of both N- and O-linked keratan sulfate proteoglycans. Cooperates with B3GNT7 N-acetyl glucosamine transferase and CHST6 and CHST1 sulfotransferases to construct and elongate mono- and disulfated disaccharide units  and  within keratan sulfate polymer (PubMed:17690104). Transfers Gal residue via a beta1->4 linkage to terminal 6-O-sulfoGlcNAc within the LacNac unit of core 2 O-glycans forming 6-sulfo-sialyl-Lewis X (sLex). May contribute to the generation of sLex epitope on mucin-type glycoproteins that serve as ligands for SELL/L-selectin, a major regulator of leukocyte migration (PubMed:12511560). In the biosynthesis pathway of neolacto-series glycosphingolipids, transfers Gal residue via a beta1->4 linkage to terminal GlcNAc of a lactotriaosylceramide (Lc3Cer) acceptor to form a neolactotetraosylceramide (PubMed:9792633).
