UniprotID	E0CX11
Accession	E0CX11
EntryName	STMP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Short transmembrane mitochondrial protein 1
GeneName	STMP1 C7orf73
Length	47
Function	Microprotein involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase) and complex IV (mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase complex) assembly (PubMed:35450818). Required for the formation of mitochondrial supercomplexes (SCs) (PubMed:35450818). Also required for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Mitochondrion outer membrane; Mitochondrion intermembrane space
