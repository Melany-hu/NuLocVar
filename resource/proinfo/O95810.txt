UniprotID	O95810
Accession	O95810
EntryName	CAVN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caveolae-associated protein 2 (Cavin-2) (PS-p68) (Phosphatidylserine-binding protein) (Serum deprivation-response protein)
GeneName	CAVIN2 SDPR
Length	425
Function	Plays an important role in caveolar biogenesis and morphology. Regulates caveolae morphology by inducing membrane curvature within caveolae (PubMed:19525939). Plays a role in caveola formation in a tissue-specific manner. Required for the formation of caveolae in the lung and fat endothelia but not in the heart endothelia. Negatively regulates the size or stability of CAVIN complexes in the lung endothelial cells. May play a role in targeting PRKCA to caveolae (By similarity).
