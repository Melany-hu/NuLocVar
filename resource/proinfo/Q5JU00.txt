UniprotID	Q5JU00
Accession	Q5JU00;B4DX59;Q8IYS6
EntryName	DRC5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynein regulatory complex subunit 5 (T-complex-associated testis-expressed protein 1) (Tcte-1)
GeneName	TCTE1 DRC5
Length	501
Function	Component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) a key regulator of ciliary/flagellar motility which maintains the alignment and integrity of the distal axoneme and regulates microtubule sliding in motile axonemes. May play a role in the assembly of N-DRC. May be required for sperm motility.
