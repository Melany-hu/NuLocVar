UniprotID	Q15466
Accession	Q15466;F1D8P5;Q5QP36
EntryName	NR0B2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear receptor subfamily 0 group B member 2 (Orphan nuclear receptor SHP) (Small heterodimer partner)
GeneName	NR0B2 SHP
Length	257
Function	Transcriptional regulator that acts as a negative regulator of receptor-dependent signaling pathways (PubMed:22504882). Specifically inhibits transactivation of the nuclear receptor with which it interacts (PubMed:22504882). Inhibits transcriptional activity of NEUROD1 on E-box-containing promoter by interfering with the coactivation function of the p300/CBP-mediated transcription complex for NEUROD1 (PubMed:14752053). Essential component of the liver circadian clock which via its interaction with NR1D1 and RORG regulates NPAS2-mediated hepatic lipid metabolism (By similarity). Regulates the circadian expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (By similarity). Represses: NR5A2 and HNF4A to down-regulate CYP2C38, NFLI3 to up-regulate CYP2A5, BHLHE41/HNF1A axis to up-regulate CYP1A2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A11, and NR1D1 to up-regulate CYP2B10, CYP4A10 and CYP4A14 (By similarity).
