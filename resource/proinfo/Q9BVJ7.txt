UniprotID	Q9BVJ7
Accession	Q9BVJ7;Q9NX48
EntryName	DUS23_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity protein phosphatase 23 (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.48) (Low molecular mass dual specificity phosphatase 3) (LDP-3) (VH1-like phosphatase Z)
GeneName	DUSP23 LDP3 VHZ
Length	150
Function	Protein phosphatase that mediates dephosphorylation of proteins phosphorylated on Tyr and Ser/Thr residues. In vitro, it can dephosphorylate p44-ERK1 (MAPK3) but not p54 SAPK-beta (MAPK10) in vitro. Able to enhance activation of JNK and p38 (MAPK14).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Nucleus
