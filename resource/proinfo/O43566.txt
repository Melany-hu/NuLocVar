UniprotID	O43566
Accession	O43566;O43565;Q506M1;Q6ZWA4;Q8TD62
EntryName	RGS14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 14 (RGS14)
GeneName	RGS14
Length	566
Function	Regulates G protein-coupled receptor signaling cascades. Inhibits signal transduction by increasing the GTPase activity of G protein alpha subunits, thereby driving them into their inactive GDP-bound form. Besides, modulates signal transduction via G protein alpha subunits by functioning as a GDP-dissociation inhibitor (GDI). Has GDI activity on G(i) alpha subunits GNAI1 and GNAI3, but not on GNAI2 and G(o)-alpha subunit GNAO1. Has GAP activity on GNAI0, GNAI2 and GNAI3. May act as a scaffold integrating G protein and Ras/Raf MAPkinase signaling pathways. Inhibits platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation; a process depending on its interaction with HRAS and that is reversed by G(i) alpha subunit GNAI1. Acts as a positive modulator of microtubule polymerisation and spindle organization through a G(i)-alpha-dependent mechanism. Plays a role in cell division. Required for the nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neurite outgrowth. Involved in stress resistance. May be involved in visual memory processing capacity and hippocampal-based learning and memory.
