UniprotID	Q9NR28
Accession	Q9NR28;B2RDQ0;Q6W3F3;Q96LV0;Q9BT11;Q9HAV6
EntryName	DBLOH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Diablo IAP-binding mitochondrial protein (Diablo homolog, mitochondrial) (Direct IAP-binding protein with low pI) (Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) (SMAC) [Cleaved into: Diablo IAP-binding mitochondrial protein, cleaved form]
GeneName	DIABLO SMAC
Length	239
Function	Promotes apoptosis by activating caspases in the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9 pathway. Acts by opposing the inhibitory activity of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP). Inhibits the activity of BIRC6/BRUCE by inhibiting its binding to caspases (PubMed:15200957, PubMed:36758104, PubMed:36758105, PubMed:36758106).
