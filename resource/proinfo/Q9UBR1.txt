EntryName	BUP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-ureidopropionase (EC 3.5.1.6) (BUP-1) (Beta-alanine synthase) (N-carbamoyl-beta-alanine amidohydrolase)
GeneName	UPB1 BUP1
Length	384
Function	Catalyzes a late step in pyrimidine degradation (PubMed:22525402, PubMed:24526388). Converts N-carbamoyl-beta-alanine (3-ureidopropanoate) into beta-alanine, ammonia and carbon dioxide (PubMed:10415095, PubMed:10542323, PubMed:11508704, PubMed:22525402, PubMed:24526388, PubMed:29976570). Likewise, converts N-carbamoyl-beta-aminoisobutyrate (3-ureidoisobutyrate) into beta-aminoisobutyrate, ammonia and carbon dioxide (Probable).
