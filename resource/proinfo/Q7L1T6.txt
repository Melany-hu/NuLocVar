UniprotID	Q7L1T6
Accession	Q7L1T6;B1AEM2;Q5TGI9;Q9NUE4;Q9UHI9
EntryName	NB5R4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome b5 reductase 4 (EC 1.6.2.2) (Flavohemoprotein b5/b5R) (b5+b5R) (N-terminal cytochrome b5 and cytochrome b5 oxidoreductase domain-containing protein) (cb5/cb5R)
GeneName	CYB5R4 NCB5OR
Length	521
Function	NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress response pathway. Plays a critical role in protecting pancreatic beta-cells against oxidant stress, possibly by protecting the cell from excess buildup of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reduces a variety of substrates in vitro, such as cytochrome c, feericyanide and methemoglobin.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum
