EntryName	GLYR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytokine-like nuclear factor N-PAC (NPAC) (3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase-like protein) (Glyoxylate reductase 1 homolog) (Nuclear protein NP60) (Nuclear protein of 60 kDa) (Nucleosome-destabilizing factor) (hNDF) (Putative oxidoreductase GLYR1)
GeneName	GLYR1 HIBDL NDF NP60 NPAC
Length	553
Function	Cytokine-like nuclear factor with chromatin gene reader activity involved in chromatin modification and regulation of gene expression (PubMed:23260659, PubMed:30970244). Acts as a nucleosome-destabilizing factor that is recruited to genes during transcriptional activation (PubMed:29759984, PubMed:30970244). Recognizes and binds histone H3 without a preference for specific epigenetic markers and also binds DNA (PubMed:20850016, PubMed:30970244). Interacts with KDM1B and promotes its histone demethylase activity by facilitating the capture of H3 tails, they form a multifunctional enzyme complex that modifies transcribed chromatin and facilitates Pol II transcription through nucleosomes (PubMed:23260659, PubMed:29759984, PubMed:30970244). Stimulates the acetylation of 'Lys-56' of nucleosomal histone H3 (H3K56ac) by EP300 (PubMed:29759984). With GATA4, co-binds a defined set of heart development genes and coregulates their expression during cardiomyocyte differentiation (PubMed:35182466). Regulates p38 MAP kinase activity by mediating stress activation of MAPK14/p38alpha and specifically regulating MAPK14 signaling (PubMed:16352664). Indirectly promotes phosphorylation of MAPK14 and activation of ATF2 (PubMed:16352664). The phosphorylation of MAPK14 requires upstream activity of MAP2K4 and MAP2K6 (PubMed:16352664).
