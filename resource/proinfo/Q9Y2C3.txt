Accession	Q9Y2C3;A8KA86;D3DSI3;Q2M3L5;Q53Z19;Q9NY96;Q9P1X6;Q9P1X7
EntryName	B3GT5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 5 (Beta-1,3-GalTase 5) (Beta3Gal-T5) (Beta3GalT5) (b3Gal-T5) (EC 2.4.1.-) (Beta-3-Gx-T5) (UDP-Gal:beta-GlcNAc beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 5) (UDP-galactose:beta-N-acetylglucosamine beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase 5)
GeneName	B3GALT5
Length	310
