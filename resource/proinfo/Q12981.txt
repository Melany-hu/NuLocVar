EntryName	SEC20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vesicle transport protein SEC20 (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 1) (Transformation-related gene 8 protein) (TRG-8)
GeneName	BNIP1 NIP1 SEC20L TRG8
Length	228
Function	As part of a SNARE complex may be involved in endoplasmic reticulum membranes fusion and be required for the maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum organization (PubMed:15272311). Also plays a role in apoptosis (PubMed:15272311, PubMed:23896122, PubMed:7954800). It is for instance required for endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis (PubMed:23896122). As a substrate of RNF185 interacting with SQSTM1, might also be involved in mitochondrial autophagy (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Mitochondrion membrane
