UniprotID	Q9UIW0
Accession	Q9UIW0;Q53Y33
EntryName	VAX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ventral anterior homeobox 2
GeneName	VAX2
Length	290
Function	Transcription factor that may function in dorsoventral specification of the forebrain. Regulates the expression of Wnt signaling antagonists including the expression of a truncated TCF7L2 isoform that cannot bind CTNNB1 and acts therefore as a potent dominant-negative Wnt antagonist. Plays a crucial role in eye development and, in particular, in the specification of the ventral optic vesicle (By similarity). May be a regulator of axial polarization in the retina.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
