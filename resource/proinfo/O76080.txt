UniprotID	O76080
Accession	O76080;A8K484
EntryName	ZFAN5_HUMAN
ProteinName	AN1-type zinc finger protein 5 (Zinc finger A20 domain-containing protein 2) (Zinc finger protein 216)
GeneName	ZFAND5 ZA20D2 ZNF216
Length	213
Function	Involved in protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. May act by anchoring ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome. Plays a role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation during muscle atrophy. Plays a role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B activation and apoptosis. Inhibits NF-kappa-B activation triggered by overexpression of RIPK1 and TRAF6 but not of RELA. Also inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1 and TLR4-induced NF-kappa-B activation in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression sensitizes cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. Is a potent inhibitory factor for osteoclast differentiation.
