UniprotID	P0CG35
Accession	P0CG35;A8K614;Q99406
EntryName	TB15B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thymosin beta-15B
GeneName	TMSB15B
Length	45
Function	Plays an important role in the organization of the cytoskeleton. Binds to and sequesters actin monomers (G actin) and therefore inhibits actin polymerization (By similarity). May be involved in cell migration (PubMed:19296525).
