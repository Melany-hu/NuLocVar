EntryName	STEA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Metalloreductase STEAP3 (EC 1.16.1.-) (Dudulin-2) (Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3) (Tumor suppressor-activated pathway protein 6) (hTSAP6) (pHyde) (hpHyde)
GeneName	STEAP3 TSAP6
Length	488
Function	Integral membrane protein that functions as a NADPH-dependent ferric-chelate reductase, using NADPH from one side of the membrane to reduce a Fe(3+) chelate that is bound on the other side of the membrane (PubMed:26205815). Mediates sequential transmembrane electron transfer from NADPH to FAD and onto heme, and finally to the Fe(3+) chelate (By similarity). Can also reduce Cu(2+) to Cu(1+) (By similarity). Mediates efficient transferrin-dependent iron uptake in erythroid cells (By similarity). May play a role downstream of p53/TP53 to interface apoptosis and cell cycle progression (By similarity). Indirectly involved in exosome secretion by facilitating the secretion of proteins such as TCTP (PubMed:15319436, PubMed:16651434).
Subcellular Location	Endosome membrane
