UniprotID	Q9Y576
Accession	Q9Y576;A6NL50;Q4ZG29;Q9ULS4
EntryName	ASB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 1 (ASB-1)
GeneName	ASB1 KIAA1146
Length	335
Function	Probable substrate-recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin-Cullin-SOCS-box protein) E3 ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:16325183). Mediates Notch-induced ubiquitination and degradation of TCF3/E2A and JAK2 (PubMed:21119685). Functions as a tumor suppressor by enhancing CHCHD3 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination, leading to inhibition of the CHCHD3/ROS signaling pathway (PubMed:39113857). Suppresses TAB2-linked 'Lys-48' polyubiquitination and consequently facilitates the initiation of NF-kappa-B and MAPK signaling cascades (PubMed:33431678). May play a role in testis development (By similarity).
