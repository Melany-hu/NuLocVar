ProteinName	Small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel protein 2 (SK2) (SKCa 2) (SKCa2) (KCa2.2)
GeneName	KCNN2
Length	231
Function	Small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel that mediates the voltage-independent transmembrane transfer of potassium across the cell membrane through a constitutive interaction with calmodulin which binds the intracellular calcium allowing its opening (PubMed:10991935, PubMed:33242881, PubMed:9287325). The current is characterized by a voltage-independent activation, an intracellular calcium concentration increase-dependent activation and a single-channel conductance of about 3 picosiemens (PubMed:10991935). Also presents an inwardly rectifying current, thus reducing its already small outward conductance of potassium ions, which is particularly the case when the membrane potential displays positive values, above + 20 mV (PubMed:10991935). The inward rectification could be due to a blockade of the outward current by intracellular divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium and could also be due to an intrinsic property of the channel pore, independent of intracellular divalent ions. There are three positively charged amino acids in the S6 transmembrane domain, close to the pore, that collectively control the conductance and rectification through an electrostatic mechanism. Additionally, electrostatic contributions from these residues also play an important role in determining the intrinsic open probability of the channel in the absence of calcium, affecting the apparent calcium affinity for activation. Forms an heteromeric complex with calmodulin, which is constitutively associated in a calcium-independent manner. Channel opening is triggered when calcium binds the calmodulin resulting in a rotary movement leading to the formation of the dimeric complex to open the gate (By similarity). Plays a role in the repolarization phase of cardiac action potential (PubMed:13679367).
