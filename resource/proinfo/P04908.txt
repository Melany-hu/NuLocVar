UniprotID	P04908
Accession	P04908;P28001;Q76P63
EntryName	H2A1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A type 1-B/E (Histone H2A.2) (Histone H2A/a) (Histone H2A/m)
GeneName	H2AC4 H2AFM HIST1H2AB; H2AC8 H2AFA HIST1H2AE
Length	130
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
