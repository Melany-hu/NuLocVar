UniprotID	A6NFY7
Accession	A6NFY7;B2RPM7
EntryName	SDHF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 1, mitochondrial (SDH assembly factor 1) (SDHAF1) (LYR motif-containing protein 8)
GeneName	SDHAF1 LYRM8
Length	115
Function	Plays an essential role in the assembly of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), an enzyme complex (also referred to as respiratory complex II) that is a component of both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and which couples the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with the reduction of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) to ubiquinol (PubMed:19465911, PubMed:24954417). Promotes maturation of the iron-sulfur protein subunit SDHB of the SDH catalytic dimer, protecting it from the deleterious effects of oxidants (PubMed:24954417). May act together with SDHAF3 (PubMed:24954417). Contributes to iron-sulfur cluster incorporation into SDHB by binding to SDHB and recruiting the iron-sulfur transfer complex formed by HSC20, HSPA9 and ISCU through direct binding to HSC20 (PubMed:26749241).
