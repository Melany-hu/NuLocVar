EntryName	E2F4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor E2F4 (E2F-4)
GeneName	E2F4
Length	413
Function	Transcription activator that binds DNA cooperatively with DP proteins through the E2 recognition site, 5'-TTTCCGC-3' found in the promoter region of a number of genes whose products are involved in cell cycle regulation or in DNA replication. The DRTF1/E2F complex functions in the control of cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase. E2F4 binds with high affinity to RBL1 and RBL2. In some instances can also bind RB1. Specifically required for multiciliate cell differentiation: together with MCIDAS and E2F5, binds and activate genes required for centriole biogenesis.
