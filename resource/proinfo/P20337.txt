UniprotID	P20337
Accession	P20337;Q5VUL2;Q9BSI1
EntryName	RAB3B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-3B (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB3B
Length	219
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes (PubMed:35871249). Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (PubMed:35871249).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Golgi apparatus
