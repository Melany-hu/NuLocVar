UniprotID	P53597
Accession	P53597;Q9BWB0;Q9UNP6
EntryName	SUCA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Succinate--CoA ligase [ADP/GDP-forming] subunit alpha, mitochondrial (EC 6.2.1.4) (EC 6.2.1.5) (Succinyl-CoA synthetase subunit alpha) (SCS-alpha)
GeneName	SUCLG1
Length	346
Function	Succinyl-CoA synthetase functions in the citric acid cycle (TCA), coupling the hydrolysis of succinyl-CoA to the synthesis of either ATP or GTP and thus represents the only step of substrate-level phosphorylation in the TCA. The alpha subunit of the enzyme binds the substrates coenzyme A and phosphate, while succinate binding and specificity for either ATP or GTP is provided by different beta subunits.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
