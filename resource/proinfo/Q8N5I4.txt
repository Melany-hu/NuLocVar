UniprotID	Q8N5I4
Accession	Q8N5I4;Q6UWC7;Q8WUS4;Q96GR8;Q9NTF6
EntryName	DHRSX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polyprenol dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.-.-) (DHRSXY) (Dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member on chromosome X) (Dolichal reductase) (EC 1.3.-.-)
GeneName	DHRSX CXorf11 DHRS5X SDR46C1 SDR7C6 UNQ6508/PRO21433
Length	330
Function	Oxidoreductase that plays a key role in early steps of protein N-linked glycosylation by mediating two non-consecutive steps in dolichol biosynthesis (PubMed:38821050). Acts both as a NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenase and as a NADPH-dependent reductase during the conversion of polyprenol into dolichol (PubMed:38821050). First catalyzes the NAD(+)-dependent dehydrogenation of polyprenol into polyprenal; polyprenal is then reduced into dolichal by SRD5A3 (PubMed:38821050). It then catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of dolichal into dolichol (PubMed:38821050). May also acts as a positive regulator of starvation-induced autophagy (PubMed:25076851).
