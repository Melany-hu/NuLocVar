UniprotID	Q6PEX3
Accession	Q6PEX3;B0RZD3
EntryName	KR261_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 26-1
GeneName	KRTAP26-1 KAP26.1
Length	210
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
