UniprotID	O95777
Accession	O95777
EntryName	LSM8_HUMAN
ProteinName	U6 snRNA-associated Sm-like protein LSm8
GeneName	LSM8
Length	96
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing as component of the U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP complex that is involved in spliceosome assembly, and as component of the precatalytic spliceosome (spliceosome B complex) (PubMed:28781166). The heptameric LSM2-8 complex binds specifically to the 3'-terminal U-tract of U6 snRNA (PubMed:10523320).
