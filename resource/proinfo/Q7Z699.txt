EntryName	SPRE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing protein 1 (Spred-1) (hSpred1)
GeneName	SPRED1
Length	444
Function	Tyrosine kinase substrate that inhibits growth-factor-mediated activation of MAP kinase (By similarity). Negatively regulates hematopoiesis of bone marrow (By similarity). Inhibits fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-induced retinal lens fiber differentiation, probably by inhibiting FGF-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (By similarity). Attenuates actin stress fiber formation via inhibition of TESK1-mediated phosphorylation of cofilin (PubMed:18216281). Inhibits TGFB-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in lens epithelial cells (By similarity).
