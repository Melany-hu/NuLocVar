UniprotID	Q16762
Accession	Q16762;B3KRM1;Q6IB06
EntryName	THTR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (EC 2.8.1.1) (Rhodanese)
GeneName	TST
Length	297
Function	Formation of iron-sulfur complexes, cyanide detoxification or modification of sulfur-containing enzymes. Other thiol compounds, besides cyanide, can act as sulfur ion acceptors. Also has weak mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) activity (By similarity). Together with MRPL18, acts as a mitochondrial import factor for the cytosolic 5S rRNA. Only the nascent unfolded cytoplasmic form is able to bind to the 5S rRNA.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
