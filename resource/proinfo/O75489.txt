UniprotID	O75489
Accession	O75489;B2R9J1;B4DFM8;Q9UNQ8
EntryName	NDUS3_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 3, mitochondrial (EC 7.1.1.2) (Complex I-30kD) (CI-30kD) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 30 kDa subunit)
GeneName	NDUFS3
Length	264
Function	Core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) which catalyzes electron transfer from NADH through the respiratory chain, using ubiquinone as an electron acceptor (PubMed:14729820, PubMed:30140060). Essential for the catalytic activity and assembly of complex I (PubMed:14729820, PubMed:24028823, PubMed:30140060).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
