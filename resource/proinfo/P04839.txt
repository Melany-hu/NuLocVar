UniprotID	P04839
Accession	P04839;A8K138;Q2PP16
EntryName	CY24B_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADPH oxidase 2 (EC 1.6.3.-) (CGD91-phox) (Cytochrome b(558) subunit beta) (Cytochrome b558 subunit beta) (Cytochrome b-245 heavy chain) (Heme-binding membrane glycoprotein gp91phox) (Neutrophil cytochrome b 91 kDa polypeptide) (Superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase heavy chain subunit) (gp91-1) (gp91-phox) (p22 phagocyte B-cytochrome)
GeneName	CYBB NOX2
Length	570
Function	Catalytic subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex that mediates the transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADPH to O2 to produce the superoxide anion (O2(-)) (PubMed:15338276, PubMed:36241643, PubMed:36413210, PubMed:38355798). In the activated complex, electrons are first transferred from NADPH to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and subsequently transferred via two heme molecules to molecular oxygen, producing superoxide through an outer-sphere reaction (Probable) (PubMed:38355798). Activation of the NADPH oxidase complex is initiated by the assembly of cytosolic subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex with the core NADPH oxidase complex to form a complex at the plasma membrane or phagosomal membrane (PubMed:19028840, PubMed:38355798). This activation process is initiated by phosphorylation dependent binding of the cytosolic NCF1/p47-phox subunit to the C-terminus of CYBA/p22-phox (By similarity). NADPH oxidase complex assembly is impaired through interaction with NRROS (By similarity).
