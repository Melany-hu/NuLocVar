UniprotID	Q9Y6A4
Accession	Q9Y6A4
EntryName	CFA20_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 20 (Basal body up-regulated protein 22) (Transcription factor IIB)
GeneName	CFAP20 BUG22 C16orf80 GTL3
Length	193
Function	Cilium- and flagellum-specific protein that plays a role in axonemal structure organization and motility (PubMed:24414207). Microtubule inner protein (MIP) part of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in cilia axoneme, which is required for motile cilia beating (PubMed:36191189). Involved in the regulation of the size and morphology of cilia (PubMed:24414207). Required for axonemal microtubules polyglutamylation (PubMed:24414207).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome; Centriole; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium basal body; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium axoneme; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Flagellum axoneme
