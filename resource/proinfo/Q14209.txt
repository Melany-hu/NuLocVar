UniprotID	Q14209
Accession	Q14209;B2R9W1;Q7Z6H1
EntryName	E2F2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor E2F2 (E2F-2)
GeneName	E2F2
Length	437
Function	Transcription activator that binds DNA cooperatively with DP proteins through the E2 recognition site, 5'-TTTCCGC-3' found in the promoter region of a number of genes whose products are involved in cell cycle regulation or in DNA replication. The DRTF1/E2F complex functions in the control of cell-cycle progression from g1 to s phase. E2F2 binds specifically to RB1 in a cell-cycle dependent manner.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
