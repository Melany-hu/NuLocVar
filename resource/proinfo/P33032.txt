UniprotID	P33032
Accession	P33032;B0YJ34;Q502V1
EntryName	MC5R_HUMAN
ProteinName	Melanocortin receptor 5 (MC5-R) (MC-2)
GeneName	MC5R
Length	325
Function	Receptor for MSH (alpha, beta and gamma) and ACTH. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylate cyclase. This receptor is a possible mediator of the immunomodulation properties of melanocortins.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
