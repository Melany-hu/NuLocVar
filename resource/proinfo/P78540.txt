ProteinName	Arginase-2, mitochondrial (EC 3.5.3.1) (Arginase II) (Kidney-type arginase) (Non-hepatic arginase) (Type II arginase)
GeneName	ARG2
Length	354
Function	May play a role in the regulation of extra-urea cycle arginine metabolism and also in down-regulation of nitric oxide synthesis. Extrahepatic arginase functions to regulate L-arginine bioavailability to nitric oxid synthase (NOS). Arginine metabolism is a critical regulator of innate and adaptive immune responses. Seems to be involved in negative regulation of the survival capacity of activated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (PubMed:27745970). May suppress inflammation-related signaling in asthmatic airway epithelium (PubMed:27214549). May contribute to the immune evasion of H.pylori by restricting M1 macrophage activation and polyamine metabolism (By similarity). In fetal dendritic cells may play a role in promoting immune suppression and T cell TNF-alpha production during gestation (PubMed:28614294). Regulates RPS6KB1 signaling, which promotes endothelial cell senescence and inflammation and implicates NOS3/eNOS dysfunction (PubMed:22928666). Can inhibit endothelial autophagy independently of its enzymatic activity implicating mTORC2 signaling (PubMed:25484082). Involved in vascular smooth muscle cell senescence and apoptosis independently of its enzymatic activity (PubMed:23832324). Since NOS is found in the penile corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, the clitoral corpus cavernosum and the vagina, arginase-2 plays a role in both male and female sexual arousal (PubMed:12859189).
