UniprotID	P14324
Accession	P14324;D3DV91;E9PCI9;Q96G29
EntryName	FPPS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPP synthase) (FPS) (EC 2.5.1.10) ((2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate synthase) (Dimethylallyltranstransferase) (EC 2.5.1.1) (Farnesyl diphosphate synthase) (Geranyltranstransferase)
GeneName	FDPS FPS KIAA1293
Length	419
Function	Key enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis which catalyzes the formation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), a precursor for several classes of essential metabolites including sterols, dolichols, carotenoids, and ubiquinones. FPP also serves as substrate for protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation. Catalyzes the sequential condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate with the allylic pyrophosphates, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, and then with the resultant geranylpyrophosphate to the ultimate product farnesyl pyrophosphate.
