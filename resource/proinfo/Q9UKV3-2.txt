UniprotID	Q9UKV3-2
Accession	Q9UKV3;B2RTT4;D3DS45;O75158;Q9UG91;Q9UKV1;Q9UKV2
EntryName	ACINU_HUMAN
ProteinName	Apoptotic chromatin condensation inducer in the nucleus (Acinus)
GeneName	ACIN1 ACINUS KIAA0670
Length	614
Function	Auxiliary component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junction on mRNAs. The EJC is a dynamic structure consisting of core proteins and several peripheral nuclear and cytoplasmic associated factors that join the complex only transiently either during EJC assembly or during subsequent mRNA metabolism. Component of the ASAP complexes which bind RNA in a sequence-independent manner and are proposed to be recruited to the EJC prior to or during the splicing process and to regulate specific excision of introns in specific transcription subsets; ACIN1 confers RNA-binding to the complex. The ASAP complex can inhibit RNA processing during in vitro splicing reactions. The ASAP complex promotes apoptosis and is disassembled after induction of apoptosis. Involved in the splicing modulation of BCL2L1/Bcl-X (and probably other apoptotic genes); specifically inhibits formation of proapoptotic isoforms such as Bcl-X(S); the activity is different from the established EJC assembly and function. Induces apoptotic chromatin condensation after activation by CASP3. Regulates cyclin A1, but not cyclin A2, expression in leukemia cells.
