UniprotID	Q8NFT2
Accession	Q8NFT2;A4D1F1;G5E9C6;Q6UXN6;Q6YPB1;Q8IUE7
EntryName	STEA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Metalloreductase STEAP2 (EC 1.16.1.-) (Prostate cancer-associated protein 1) (Protein up-regulated in metastatic prostate cancer) (PUMPCn) (Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 2) (SixTransMembrane protein of prostate 1)
GeneName	STEAP2 PCANAP1 STAMP1 UNQ6507/PRO23203
Length	490
Function	Integral membrane protein that functions as a NADPH-dependent ferric-chelate reductase, using NADPH from one side of the membrane to reduce a Fe(3+) chelate that is bound on the other side of the membrane (By similarity). Mediates sequential transmembrane electron transfer from NADPH to FAD and onto heme, and finally to the Fe(3+) chelate (By similarity). Can also reduce Cu(2+) to Cu(1+) (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endosome membrane; Cell membrane
