UniprotID	Q9NV56
Accession	Q9NV56;A8C4L5
EntryName	MRGBP_HUMAN
ProteinName	MRG/MORF4L-binding protein (MRG-binding protein) (Up-regulated in colon cancer 4) (Urcc4)
GeneName	MRGBP C20orf20
Length	204
Function	Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex which is involved in transcriptional activation of select genes principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histones H4 and H2A. This modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription. This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence, apoptosis, and DNA repair. NuA4 may also play a direct role in DNA repair when recruited to sites of DNA damage.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
