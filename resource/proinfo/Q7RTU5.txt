UniprotID	Q7RTU5
Accession	Q7RTU5
EntryName	ASCL5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Achaete-scute homolog 5 (ASH-5) (hASH5) (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 47) (bHLHa47)
GeneName	ASCL5 BHLHA47
Length	278
Function	Transcription factor. Probably binds E-box motifs 5'-CANNTG-3' in complex with transcription factor TCF3/E12. Negatively modulates transcription of target genes such as CDH1/E-cadherin, perhaps by recruiting the PRC2 repressive complex to regulatory elements. Regulates ameloblast development and tooth germ growth, perhaps acting by positively modulating migration of inner enamel epithelium (IEE) cells. Plays a role in enamel formation.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
