UniprotID	P60953
Accession	P60953;P21181;P25763;Q7L8R5;Q9UDI2
EntryName	CDC42_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cell division control protein 42 homolog (EC 3.6.5.2) (G25K GTP-binding protein)
GeneName	CDC42
Length	191
Function	Plasma membrane-associated small GTPase which cycles between an active GTP-bound and an inactive GDP-bound state. In active state binds to a variety of effector proteins to regulate cellular responses. Involved in epithelial cell polarization processes. Regulates the bipolar attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores before chromosome congression in metaphase (PubMed:15642749). Regulates cell migration (PubMed:17038317, PubMed:22843693). In neurons, plays a role in the extension and maintenance of the formation of filopodia, thin and actin-rich surface projections (PubMed:14978216). Required for DOCK10-mediated spine formation in Purkinje cells and hippocampal neurons. In podocytes, facilitates filopodia and podosomes formation upon DOCK11-activation (PubMed:33523862). Upon activation by CaMKII, modulates dendritic spine structural plasticity by relaying CaMKII transient activation to synapse-specific, long-term signaling (By similarity). Also plays a role in phagocytosis through organization of the F-actin cytoskeleton associated with forming phagocytic cups (PubMed:26465210). Upon activation by PLEKHG4B, involved in actin cytoskeletal remodeling during epithelial cell-cell junction formation (PubMed:33310911).
