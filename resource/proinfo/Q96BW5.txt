EntryName	PTER_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acetyltaurine hydrolase (EC 3.1.-.-) (Phosphotriesterase-related protein)
GeneName	PTER
Length	349
Function	N-acetyltaurine hydrolase that regulates feeding by catalyzing the hydrolysis of N-acetyltaurine into taurine and acetate (PubMed:39112712). N-acetyltaurine has anorexigenic and anti-obesity effects that are dependent on GFRAL receptor and GDF15 (By similarity). PTER also acts on other N-acetyl amino acids (Met, Ile, Leu, Val) and N-propionyltaurine, but at lower rates (By similarity).
