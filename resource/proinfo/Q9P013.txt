EntryName	CWC15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Spliceosome-associated protein CWC15 homolog
GeneName	CWC15 C11orf5 AD-002 HSPC148
Length	229
Function	Involved in pre-mRNA splicing as component of the spliceosome (PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770). Component of the PRP19-CDC5L complex that forms an integral part of the spliceosome and is required for activating pre-mRNA splicing. As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (Probable).
