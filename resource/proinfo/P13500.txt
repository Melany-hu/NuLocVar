UniprotID	P13500
Accession	P13500;B2R4V3;Q9UDF3
EntryName	CCL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 2 (HC11) (Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) (Monocyte chemotactic and activating factor) (MCAF) (Monocyte chemotactic protein 1) (MCP-1) (Monocyte secretory protein JE) (Small-inducible cytokine A2)
GeneName	CCL2 MCP1 SCYA2
Length	99
Function	Acts as a ligand for C-C chemokine receptor CCR2 (PubMed:10529171, PubMed:10587439, PubMed:9837883). Signals through binding and activation of CCR2 and induces a strong chemotactic response and mobilization of intracellular calcium ions (PubMed:10587439, PubMed:9837883). Exhibits a chemotactic activity for monocytes and basophils but not neutrophils or eosinophils (PubMed:8195247, PubMed:8627182, PubMed:9792674). May be involved in the recruitment of monocytes into the arterial wall during the disease process of atherosclerosis (PubMed:8107690).
