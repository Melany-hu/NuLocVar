UniprotID	P61421
Accession	P61421;P12953;Q02547
EntryName	VA0D1_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit d 1 (V-ATPase subunit d 1) (32 kDa accessory protein) (V-ATPase 40 kDa accessory protein) (V-ATPase AC39 subunit) (p39) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit d 1)
GeneName	ATP6V0D1 ATP6D VPATPD
Length	351
Function	Subunit of the V0 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons (PubMed:28296633, PubMed:30374053, PubMed:33065002). V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment (PubMed:30374053). May play a role in coupling of proton transport and ATP hydrolysis (By similarity). In aerobic conditions, involved in intracellular iron homeostasis, thus triggering the activity of Fe(2+) prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes, and leading to HIF1A hydroxylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:28296633). May play a role in cilium biogenesis through regulation of the transport and the localization of proteins to the cilium (By similarity).
