UniprotID	Q86X67
Accession	Q86X67;B4DV90;O95650;Q5SQM4;Q5SQM5;Q5SQM6;Q9Y3X2
EntryName	NUD13_HUMAN
ProteinName	NAD(P)H pyrophosphatase NUDT13, mitochondrial (EC 3.6.1.22) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 13) (Nudix motif 13) (Protein KiSS-16)
GeneName	NUDT13
Length	352
Function	NAD(P)H pyrophosphatase that hydrolyzes NADH into NMNH and AMP, and NADPH into NMNH and 2',5'-ADP. Has a marked preference for the reduced pyridine nucleotides. Does not show activity toward NAD-capped RNAs; the NAD-cap is an atypical cap present at the 5'-end of some RNAs.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
