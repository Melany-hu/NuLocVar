UniprotID	Q9UK58
Accession	Q9UK58;B3KMY3;C9JPL0;Q6NVY9;Q6UWS7;Q8NI48;Q96QT0;Q9NZF3
EntryName	CCNL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-L1 (Cyclin-L)
GeneName	CCNL1 BM-001 UNQ530/PRO1073
Length	526
Function	Involved in pre-mRNA splicing. Functions in association with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (PubMed:18216018). Inhibited by the CDK-specific inhibitor CDKN1A/p21 (PubMed:11980906). May play a role in the regulation of RNA polymerase II (pol II). May be a candidate proto-oncogene in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) (PubMed:12414649, PubMed:15700036).
