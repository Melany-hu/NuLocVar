UniprotID	Q9Y6K8
Accession	Q9Y6K8;Q5U622;Q6FH66;Q7Z4T5;Q86YS0;Q8N464;Q96EC9
EntryName	KAD5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenylate kinase isoenzyme 5 (AK 5) (EC 2.7.4.3) (EC 2.7.4.6) (ATP-AMP transphosphorylase 5)
GeneName	AK5
Length	562
Function	Nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinase that catalyzes the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphate group between nucleoside triphosphates and monophosphates. Active on AMP and dAMP with ATP as a donor. When GTP is used as phosphate donor, the enzyme phosphorylates AMP, CMP, and to a small extent dCMP. Also displays broad nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
