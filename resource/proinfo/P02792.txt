Accession	P02792;B2R4B9;Q6IBT7;Q7Z2W1;Q86WI9;Q8WU07;Q96AU9;Q96CU0;Q9BTZ8
EntryName	FRIL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ferritin light chain (Ferritin L subunit)
GeneName	FTL
Length	175
Function	Stores iron in a soluble, non-toxic, readily available form. Important for iron homeostasis. Iron is taken up in the ferrous form and deposited as ferric hydroxides after oxidation. Also plays a role in delivery of iron to cells. Mediates iron uptake in capsule cells of the developing kidney (By similarity). Delivery to lysosomes by the cargo receptor NCOA4 for autophagic degradation and release or iron (PubMed:24695223).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome; Cytoplasm; Autolysosome
