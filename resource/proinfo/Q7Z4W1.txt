UniprotID	Q7Z4W1
Accession	Q7Z4W1;Q9BTZ3;Q9UHY9
EntryName	DCXR_HUMAN
ProteinName	L-xylulose reductase (XR) (EC 1.1.1.10) (Carbonyl reductase II) (Dicarbonyl/L-xylulose reductase) (Kidney dicarbonyl reductase) (kiDCR) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 20C member 1) (Sperm surface protein P34H)
GeneName	DCXR SDR20C1
Length	244
Function	Catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of several pentoses, tetroses, trioses, alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and L-xylulose. Participates in the uronate cycle of glucose metabolism. May play a role in the water absorption and cellular osmoregulation in the proximal renal tubules by producing xylitol, an osmolyte, thereby preventing osmolytic stress from occurring in the renal tubules.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
