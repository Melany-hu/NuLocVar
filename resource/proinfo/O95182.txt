UniprotID	O95182
Accession	O95182
EntryName	NDUA7_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 7 (Complex I-B14.5a) (CI-B14.5a) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B14.5a)
GeneName	NDUFA7
Length	113
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
