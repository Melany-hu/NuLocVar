ProteinName	A-kinase anchor protein 8 (AKAP-8) (A-kinase anchor protein 95 kDa) (AKAP 95)
GeneName	AKAP8 AKAP95
Length	692
Function	Anchoring protein that mediates the subcellular compartmentation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA type II) (PubMed:9473338). Acts as an anchor for a PKA-signaling complex onto mitotic chromosomes, which is required for maintenance of chromosomes in a condensed form throughout mitosis. Recruits condensin complex subunit NCAPD2 to chromosomes required for chromatin condensation; the function appears to be independent from PKA-anchoring (PubMed:10601332, PubMed:10791967, PubMed:11964380). May help to deliver cyclin D/E to CDK4 to facilitate cell cycle progression (PubMed:14641107). Required for cell cycle G2/M transition and histone deacetylation during mitosis. In mitotic cells recruits HDAC3 to the vicinity of chromatin leading to deacetylation and subsequent phosphorylation at 'Ser-10' of histone H3; in this function may act redundantly with AKAP8L (PubMed:16980585). Involved in nuclear retention of RPS6KA1 upon ERK activation thus inducing cell proliferation (PubMed:22130794). May be involved in regulation of DNA replication by acting as scaffold for MCM2 (PubMed:12740381). Enhances HMT activity of the KMT2 family MLL4/WBP7 complex and is involved in transcriptional regulation. In a teratocarcinoma cell line is involved in retinoic acid-mediated induction of developmental genes implicating H3 'Lys-4' methylation (PubMed:23995757). May be involved in recruitment of active CASP3 to the nucleus in apoptotic cells (PubMed:16227597). May act as a carrier protein of GJA1 for its transport to the nucleus (PubMed:26880274). May play a repressive role in the regulation of rDNA transcription. Preferentially binds GC-rich DNA in vitro. In cells, associates with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) chromatin, preferentially with rRNA promoter and transcribed regions (PubMed:26683827). Involved in modulation of Toll-like receptor signaling. Required for the cAMP-dependent suppression of TNF-alpha in early stages of LPS-induced macrophage activation; the function probably implicates targeting of PKA to NFKB1 (By similarity).
