UniprotID	P51452
Accession	P51452;D3DX45;Q5U0J1;Q8IYJ9
EntryName	DUS3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity protein phosphatase 3 (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.48) (Dual specificity protein phosphatase VHR) (Vaccinia H1-related phosphatase) (VHR)
GeneName	DUSP3 VHR
Length	185
Function	Shows activity both for tyrosine-protein phosphate and serine-protein phosphate, but displays a strong preference toward phosphotyrosines (PubMed:10224087, PubMed:11863439). Specifically dephosphorylates and inactivates ERK1 and ERK2 (PubMed:10224087, PubMed:11863439).
