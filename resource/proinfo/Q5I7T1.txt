Accession	Q5I7T1;B2RPF4
EntryName	AG10B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dol-P-Glc:Glc(2)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.256) (Alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase ALG10-A) (Alpha-2-glucosyltransferase ALG10-B) (Asparagine-linked glycosylation protein 10 homolog B) (Potassium channel regulator 1)
GeneName	ALG10B KCR1
Length	473
Function	Dol-P-Glc:Glc(2)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase that operates in the biosynthetic pathway of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides, the glycan precursors employed in protein asparagine (N)-glycosylation. The assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides begins on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and finishes in its lumen. The sequential addition of sugars to dolichol pyrophosphate produces dolichol-linked oligosaccharides containing fourteen sugars, including two GlcNAcs, nine mannoses and three glucoses. Once assembled, the oligosaccharide is transferred from the lipid to nascent proteins by oligosaccharyltransferases. In the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, adds the third and last glucose residue from dolichyl phosphate glucose (Dol-P-Glc) onto the lipid-linked oligosaccharide intermediate Glc(2)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol to produce Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol.
