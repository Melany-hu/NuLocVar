UniprotID	Q6IA17
Accession	Q6IA17;Q3KQY2;Q6UXI3;Q9H733
EntryName	SIGIR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Single Ig IL-1-related receptor (Single Ig IL-1R-related molecule) (Single immunoglobulin domain-containing IL1R-related protein) (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor 8) (TIR8)
GeneName	SIGIRR UNQ301/PRO342
Length	410
Function	Acts as a negative regulator of the Toll-like and IL-1R receptor signaling pathways. Attenuates the recruitment of receptor-proximal signaling components to the TLR4 receptor, probably through an TIR-TIR domain interaction with TLR4. Through its extracellular domain interferes with the heterodimerization of Il1R1 and IL1RAP.
