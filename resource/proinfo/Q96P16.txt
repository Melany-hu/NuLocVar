UniprotID	Q96P16
Accession	Q96P16;A8KA42;B2RBA3;Q7Z5G8;Q96FY9;Q9NVL4
EntryName	RPR1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulation of nuclear pre-mRNA domain-containing protein 1A (Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B-related protein) (p15INK4B-related protein)
GeneName	RPRD1A P15RS
Length	312
Function	Interacts with phosphorylated C-terminal heptapeptide repeat domain (CTD) of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit POLR2A, and participates in dephosphorylation of the CTD by RPAP2. May act as a negative regulator of cyclin-D1 (CCND1) and cyclin-E (CCNE1) in the cell cycle.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
