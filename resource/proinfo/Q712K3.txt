UniprotID	Q712K3
Accession	Q712K3;D3DRL5;Q9NX64
EntryName	UB2R2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 R2 (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme R2) (Ubiquitin carrier protein R2) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-CDC34B) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase R2)
GeneName	UBE2R2 CDC34B UBC3B
Length	238
Function	E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that accepts ubiquitin from an E1 ubiquitin-activating protein, and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins by an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (PubMed:12037680, PubMed:20061386, PubMed:38326650). In vitro catalyzes monoubiquitination and 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination (PubMed:12037680, PubMed:20061386, PubMed:38326650). Works in collaboration with various Cul1-RING and Cul2-RING E3 ligase complexes (PubMed:38326650). May be involved in degradation of katenin (PubMed:12037680).
