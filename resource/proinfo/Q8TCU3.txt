UniprotID	Q8TCU3
Accession	Q8TCU3;Q05C37;Q08AH9;Q96N84
EntryName	S7A13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 7 member 13 (Sodium-independent aspartate/glutamate transporter 1) (X-amino acid transporter 2)
GeneName	SLC7A13 AGT1 XAT2
Length	470
Function	Associates with SLC3A1/rBAT to form a functional heterodimeric complex that transports anionic and neutral amino acids across the apical plasma membrane of renal epithelium. Preferentially mediates exchange transport, but can also operate via facilitated diffusion. May act as a major transporter for L-cystine in late proximal tubules, ensuring its reabsorption from the luminal fluid in exchange for cytosolic L-glutamate or L-aspartate.
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane
