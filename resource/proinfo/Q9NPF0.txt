UniprotID	Q9NPF0
Accession	Q9NPF0;B2RDS5;D6W668;F5H6D3;Q53HF7
EntryName	CD320_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD320 antigen (8D6 antigen) (FDC-signaling molecule 8D6) (FDC-SM-8D6) (Transcobalamin receptor) (TCblR) (CD antigen CD320)
GeneName	CD320 8D6A UNQ198/PRO224
Length	282
Function	Receptor for transcobalamin saturated with cobalamin (TCbl) (PubMed:18779389). Plays an important role in cobalamin uptake (PubMed:18779389, PubMed:20524213). Plasma membrane protein that is expressed on follicular dendritic cells (FDC) and mediates interaction with germinal center B cells (PubMed:10727470). Functions as costimulator to promote B cell responses to antigenic stimuli; promotes B cell differentiation and proliferation (PubMed:10727470, PubMed:11418631). Germinal center-B (GC-B) cells differentiate into memory B-cells and plasma cells (PC) through interaction with T-cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDC) (PubMed:11418631). CD320 augments the proliferation of PC precursors generated by IL-10 (PubMed:11418631).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
