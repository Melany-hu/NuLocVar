UniprotID	P60370
Accession	P60370;Q0VAR7;Q0VAR8;Q70LJ3
EntryName	KR105_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 10-5 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.5) (Keratin-associated protein 10.5) (Keratin-associated protein 18-5) (Keratin-associated protein 18.5)
GeneName	KRTAP10-5 KAP10.5 KAP18-5 KRTAP10.5 KRTAP18-5 KRTAP18.5
Length	271
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
