UniprotID	Q6L8H2
Accession	Q6L8H2;Q6PL44;Q701N3
EntryName	KRA53_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 5-3 (Keratin-associated protein 5-9) (Keratin-associated protein 5.3) (Keratin-associated protein 5.9) (UHS KerB-like) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 5.3)
GeneName	KRTAP5-3 KAP5-9 KAP5.3 KRTAP5-9 KRTAP5.3 KRTAP5.9
Length	238
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated protein (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
