UniprotID	P30301
Accession	P30301;Q17R41
EntryName	MIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lens fiber major intrinsic protein (Aquaporin-0) (MIP26) (MP26)
GeneName	MIP AQP0
Length	263
Function	Aquaporins form homotetrameric transmembrane channels, with each monomer independently mediating water transport across the plasma membrane along its osmotic gradient (PubMed:11001937, PubMed:24120416). Specifically expressed in lens fiber cells, this aquaporin is crucial for maintaining lens water homeostasis and transparency. Beyond water permeability, it also acts as a cell-to-cell adhesion molecule, forming thin junctions between lens fiber cells that are essential for maintaining the ordered structure and transparency of the lens (PubMed:24120416).
