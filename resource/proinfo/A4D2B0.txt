UniprotID	A4D2B0
Accession	A4D2B0;Q8N5X8
EntryName	MBLC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Metallo-beta-lactamase domain-containing protein 1 (EC 3.1.27.-) (Endoribonuclease MBLAC1)
GeneName	MBLAC1
Length	266
Function	Endoribonuclease that catalyzes the hydrolysis of histone-coding pre-mRNA 3'-end. Involved in histone pre-mRNA processing during the S-phase of the cell cycle, which is required for entering/progressing through S-phase (PubMed:30507380). Cleaves histone pre-mRNA at a major and a minor cleavage site after the 5'-ACCCA-3' and the 5'-ACCCACA-3' sequence, respectively, and located downstream of the stem-loop (PubMed:30507380). May require the presence of the HDE element located at the histone pre-RNA 3'-end to avoid non-specific cleavage (PubMed:30507380).
