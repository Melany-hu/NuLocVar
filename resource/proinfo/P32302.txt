UniprotID	P32302
Accession	P32302;Q14811
EntryName	CXCR5_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXC-R5) (CXCR-5) (Burkitt lymphoma receptor 1) (Monocyte-derived receptor 15) (MDR-15) (CD antigen CD185)
GeneName	CXCR5 BLR1 MDR15
Length	372
Function	Cytokine receptor that binds to B-lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC).
