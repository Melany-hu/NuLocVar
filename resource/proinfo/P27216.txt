UniprotID	P27216
Accession	P27216;Q9BQR5
EntryName	ANX13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Annexin A13 (Annexin XIII) (Annexin-13) (Intestine-specific annexin) (ISA)
GeneName	ANXA13 ANX13
Length	316
Function	Binds to membranes enriched in phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylglycerol in a calcium-dependent manner (PubMed:27676605, PubMed:30610115). Half-maximal membrane binding requires about 60 uM calcium. Does not bind to membranes that lack phospholipids with an acidic headgroup (PubMed:27676605).
Subcellular Location	Apical cell membrane; Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle
