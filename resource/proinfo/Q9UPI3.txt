ProteinName	Choline/ethanolamine transporter FLVCR2 (Calcium-chelate transporter) (CCT) (Feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor-related protein 2) (Heme transporter FLVCR2)
GeneName	FLVCR2 C14orf58
Length	526
Function	Choline uniporter that specifically mediates choline uptake at the blood-brain-barrier (PubMed:38302740, PubMed:38778100). Responsible for the majority of choline uptake across the blood-brain-barrier from the circulation into the brain (By similarity). Choline, a nutrient critical for brain development, is a precursor of phosphatidylcholine, as well as betaine (By similarity). Also mediates transport of ethanolamine (PubMed:38778100). Choline and ethanolamine transport is not coupled with proton transport and is exclusively driven by the choline gradient across the plasma membrane (PubMed:38778100). However, the presence of an inwardly directed proton gradient enhances choline uptake (By similarity). Also acts as a heme b transporter (PubMed:20823265, PubMed:32973183). Required to regulate mitochondrial respiration processes, ATP synthesis and thermogenesis (PubMed:32973183). At low heme levels, interacts with components of electron transfer chain (ETC) complexes and ATP2A2, leading to ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ATP2A2 and inhibition of thermogenesis (PubMed:32973183). Upon heme binding, dissociates from ETC complexes to allow switching from mitochondrial ATP synthesis to thermogenesis (PubMed:32973183).
