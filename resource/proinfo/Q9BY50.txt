UniprotID	Q9BY50
Accession	Q9BY50;B2RAA3
EntryName	SC11C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal peptidase complex catalytic subunit SEC11C (EC 3.4.21.89) (Microsomal signal peptidase 21 kDa subunit) (SPase 21 kDa subunit) (SEC11 homolog C) (SEC11-like protein 3) (SPC21)
GeneName	SEC11C SEC11L3 SPC21 SPCS4C
Length	192
Function	Catalytic component of the signal peptidase complex (SPC) which catalyzes the cleavage of N-terminal signal sequences from nascent proteins as they are translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:34388369). Specifically cleaves N-terminal signal peptides that contain a hydrophobic alpha-helix (h-region) shorter than 18-20 amino acids (PubMed:34388369).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
