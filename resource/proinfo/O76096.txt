UniprotID	O76096
Accession	O76096;Q6FH95;Q7Z4J8;Q9UED4
EntryName	CYTF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cystatin-F (Cystatin-7) (Cystatin-like metastasis-associated protein) (CMAP) (Leukocystatin)
GeneName	CST7
Length	145
Function	Inhibits papain and cathepsin L but with affinities lower than other cystatins. May play a role in immune regulation through inhibition of a unique target in the hematopoietic system.
