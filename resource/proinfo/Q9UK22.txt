UniprotID	Q9UK22
Accession	Q9UK22;B2R7K7;Q5TGY0;Q6FGJ7;Q8TB29;Q9UKC6
EntryName	FBX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-box only protein 2
GeneName	FBXO2 FBX2
Length	296
Function	Substrate recognition component of a SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex that mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway (ERAD) for misfolded lumenal proteins by recognizing and binding sugar chains on unfolded glycoproteins that are retrotranslocated into the cytosol and promoting their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Prevents formation of cytosolic aggregates of unfolded glycoproteins that have been retrotranslocated into the cytosol. Able to recognize and bind denatured glycoproteins, preferentially those of the high-mannose type (By similarity).
