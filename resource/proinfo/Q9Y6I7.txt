UniprotID	Q9Y6I7
Accession	Q9Y6I7;Q9NRB1;Q9UBH9;Q9UG25;Q9UNN6;Q9Y656
EntryName	WSB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	WD repeat and SOCS box-containing protein 1 (WSB-1) (SOCS box-containing WD protein SWiP-1)
GeneName	WSB1 SWIP1
Length	421
Function	Probable substrate-recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin-Cullin-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Recognizes type II iodothyronine deiodinase/DIO2. Confers constitutive instability to HIPK2 through proteasomal degradation.
