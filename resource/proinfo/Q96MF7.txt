UniprotID	Q96MF7
Accession	Q96MF7;Q8N549
EntryName	NSE2_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 SUMO-protein ligase NSE2 (EC 2.3.2.-) (E3 SUMO-protein transferase NSE2) (MMS21 homolog) (hMMS21) (Non-structural maintenance of chromosomes element 2 homolog) (Non-SMC element 2 homolog)
GeneName	NSMCE2 C8orf36 MMS21
Length	247
Function	E3 SUMO-protein ligase component of the SMC5-SMC6 complex, a complex involved in DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination (PubMed:16055714, PubMed:16810316). Is not be required for the stability of the complex (PubMed:16055714, PubMed:16810316). The complex may promote sister chromatid homologous recombination by recruiting the SMC1-SMC3 cohesin complex to double-strand breaks (PubMed:16055714, PubMed:16810316). The complex is required for telomere maintenance via recombination in ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres) cell lines and mediates sumoylation of shelterin complex (telosome) components which is proposed to lead to shelterin complex disassembly in ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) (PubMed:17589526). Acts as an E3 ligase mediating SUMO attachment to various proteins such as SMC6L1 and TSNAX, the shelterin complex subunits TERF1, TERF2, TINF2 and TERF2IP, RAD51AP1, and maybe the cohesin components RAD21 and STAG2 (PubMed:16055714, PubMed:16810316, PubMed:17589526, PubMed:31400850). Required for recruitment of telomeres to PML nuclear bodies (PubMed:17589526). SUMO protein-ligase activity is required for the prevention of DNA damage-induced apoptosis by facilitating DNA repair, and for formation of APBs in ALT cell lines (PubMed:17589526). Required for sister chromatid cohesion during prometaphase and mitotic progression (PubMed:19502785).
