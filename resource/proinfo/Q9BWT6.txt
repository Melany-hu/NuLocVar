UniprotID	Q9BWT6
Accession	Q9BWT6;B2R5F9
EntryName	MND1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Meiotic nuclear division protein 1 homolog
GeneName	MND1 GAJ
Length	205
Function	Required for proper homologous chromosome pairing and efficient cross-over and intragenic recombination during meiosis (By similarity). Stimulates both DMC1- and RAD51-mediated homologous strand assimilation, which is required for the resolution of meiotic double-strand breaks.
