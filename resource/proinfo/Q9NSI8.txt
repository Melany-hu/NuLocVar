UniprotID	Q9NSI8
Accession	Q9NSI8;B3KWJ3;F8WAA1;Q8NFF7;Q9C041
EntryName	SAMN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	SAM domain-containing protein SAMSN-1 (Hematopoietic adaptor containing SH3 and SAM domains 1) (Nash1) (SAM domain, SH3 domain and nuclear localization signals protein 1) (SH3-SAM adaptor protein)
GeneName	SAMSN1 HACS1
Length	373
Function	Negative regulator of B-cell activation. Down-regulates cell proliferation (in vitro). Promotes RAC1-dependent membrane ruffle formation and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Regulates cell spreading and cell polarization. Stimulates HDAC1 activity. Regulates LYN activity by modulating its tyrosine phosphorylation (By similarity).
