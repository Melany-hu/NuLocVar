UniprotID	O75312
Accession	O75312;Q2TAA0
EntryName	ZPR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein ZPR1 (Zinc finger protein 259)
GeneName	ZPR1 ZNF259
Length	459
Function	Acts as a signaling molecule that communicates proliferative growth signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. It is involved in the positive regulation of cell cycle progression (PubMed:29851065). Plays a role for the localization and accumulation of the survival motor neuron protein SMN1 in sub-nuclear bodies, including gems and Cajal bodies. Induces neuron differentiation and stimulates axonal growth and formation of growth cone in spinal cord motor neurons. Plays a role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs. May be involved in H(2)O(2)-induced neuronal cell death.
