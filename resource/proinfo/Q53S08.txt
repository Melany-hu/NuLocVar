UniprotID	Q53S08
Accession	Q53S08
EntryName	RAB6D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-6D (EC 3.6.5.2) (Rab6-like protein WTH3DI)
GeneName	RAB6D WTH3DI
Length	254
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion.
