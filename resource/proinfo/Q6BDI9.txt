UniprotID	Q6BDI9
Accession	Q6BDI9;B2RU16
EntryName	REP15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rab15 effector protein
GeneName	REP15
Length	236
Function	Effector that interacts with Rab GTPases in their active form (GTP-bound) including RAB15, RAB3A-D and RAB34. Controls downstream signaling such as cell proliferation and cell migration (PubMed:35871249). Also regulates transferrin receptor recycling from the endocytic recycling compartment (PubMed:16195351, PubMed:35871249).
Subcellular Location	Early endosome membrane
