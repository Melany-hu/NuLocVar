UniprotID	P20396
Accession	P20396;B2R8R1;Q2TB83
EntryName	TRH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pro-thyrotropin-releasing hormone (Pro-TRH) (Prothyroliberin) [Cleaved into: Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (Protirelin) (TSH-releasing factor) (Thyroliberin) (Thyrotropin-releasing factor) (TRF)]
GeneName	TRH
Length	242
Function	As a component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, it controls the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and is involved in thyroid hormone synthesis regulation. It also operates as modulator of hair growth. It promotes hair-shaft elongation, prolongs the hair cycle growth phase (anagen) and antagonizes its termination (catagen) by TGFB2. It stimulates proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of hair matrix keratinocytes.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
