ProteinName	Carbonyl reductase [NADPH] 1 (EC 1.1.1.184) (15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase [NADP(+)]) (EC 1.1.1.196, EC 1.1.1.197) (20-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) (Alcohol dehydrogenase [NAD(P)+] CBR1) (EC 1.1.1.71) (NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase 1) (Prostaglandin 9-ketoreductase) (PG-9-KR) (Prostaglandin-E(2) 9-reductase) (EC 1.1.1.189) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 21C member 1)
GeneName	CBR1 CBR CRN SDR21C1
Length	277
Function	NADPH-dependent reductase with broad substrate specificity. Catalyzes the reduction of a wide variety of carbonyl compounds including quinones, prostaglandins, menadione, plus various xenobiotics. Catalyzes the reduction of the antitumor anthracyclines doxorubicin and daunorubicin to the cardiotoxic compounds doxorubicinol and daunorubicinol (PubMed:15799708, PubMed:17344335, PubMed:17912391, PubMed:18449627, PubMed:18826943, PubMed:1921984, PubMed:7005231). Can convert prostaglandin E to prostaglandin F2-alpha (By similarity). Can bind glutathione, which explains its higher affinity for glutathione-conjugated substrates. Catalyzes the reduction of S-nitrosoglutathione (PubMed:17344335, PubMed:18826943). In addition, participates in the glucocorticoid metabolism by catalyzing the NADPH-dependent cortisol/corticosterone into 20beta-dihydrocortisol (20b-DHF) or 20beta-corticosterone (20b-DHB), which are weak agonists of NR3C1 and NR3C2 in adipose tissue (PubMed:28878267).
