UniprotID	Q9H9Q2
Accession	Q9H9Q2;Q53S22;Q5BJG3;Q9H7V6
EntryName	CSN7B_HUMAN
ProteinName	COP9 signalosome complex subunit 7b (SGN7b) (Signalosome subunit 7b) (JAB1-containing signalosome subunit 7b)
GeneName	COPS7B CSN7B
Length	264
Function	Component of the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN), a complex involved in various cellular and developmental processes. The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF-type complexes such as SCF, CSA or DDB2. The complex is also involved in phosphorylation of p53/TP53, JUN, I-kappa-B-alpha/NFKBIA, ITPK1 and IRF8/ICSBP, possibly via its association with CK2 and PKD kinases. CSN-dependent phosphorylation of TP53 and JUN promotes and protects degradation by the Ubl system, respectively.
