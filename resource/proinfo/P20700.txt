Function	Lamins are intermediate filament proteins that assemble into a filamentous meshwork, and which constitute the major components of the nuclear lamina, a fibrous layer on the nucleoplasmic side of the inner nuclear membrane (PubMed:28716252, PubMed:32910914). Lamins provide a framework for the nuclear envelope, bridging the nuclear envelope and chromatin, thereby playing an important role in nuclear assembly, chromatin organization, nuclear membrane and telomere dynamics (PubMed:28716252, PubMed:32910914). The structural integrity of the lamina is strictly controlled by the cell cycle, as seen by the disintegration and formation of the nuclear envelope in prophase and telophase, respectively (PubMed:28716252, PubMed:32910914).
