UniprotID	P17677
Accession	P17677;A8K0Y4
EntryName	NEUM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuromodulin (Axonal membrane protein GAP-43) (Growth-associated protein 43) (Neural phosphoprotein B-50) (pp46)
GeneName	GAP43
Length	238
Function	This protein is associated with nerve growth. It is a major component of the motile 'growth cones' that form the tips of elongating axons. Plays a role in axonal and dendritic filopodia induction.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell projection; Growth cone membrane; Synapse; Cell projection; Filopodium membrane; Perikaryon; Cell projection; Dendrite; Cell projection; Axon; Cytoplasm
