UniprotID	Q9BYE7
Accession	Q9BYE7;A8K3R4;Q5SYD1;Q5SYD6;Q96ID9;Q96SJ1
EntryName	PCGF6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polycomb group RING finger protein 6 (Mel18 and Bmi1-like RING finger) (RING finger protein 134)
GeneName	PCGF6 MBLR RNF134
Length	350
Function	Transcriptional repressor (PubMed:12167161). May modulate the levels of histone H3K4Me3 by activating KDM5D histone demethylase (PubMed:17320162). Component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones; it mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119', rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility (PubMed:12167161). Within the PRC1-like complex, regulates RNF2 ubiquitin ligase activity (PubMed:26151332).
