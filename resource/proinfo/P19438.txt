UniprotID	P19438
Accession	P19438;A8K4X3;B2RDE4;B3KPQ1;B4DQB7;B4E309;B5M0B5;D3DUR1;Q9UCA4
EntryName	TNR1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A (Tumor necrosis factor receptor 1) (TNF-R1) (Tumor necrosis factor receptor type I) (TNF-RI) (TNFR-I) (p55) (p60) (CD antigen CD120a) [Cleaved into: Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1A, membrane form; Tumor necrosis factor-binding protein 1 (TBPI)]
GeneName	TNFRSF1A TNFAR TNFR1
Length	455
Function	Receptor for TNFSF2/TNF-alpha and homotrimeric TNFSF1/lymphotoxin-alpha. The adapter molecule FADD recruits caspase-8 to the activated receptor. The resulting death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) performs caspase-8 proteolytic activation which initiates the subsequent cascade of caspases (aspartate-specific cysteine proteases) mediating apoptosis. Contributes to the induction of non-cytocidal TNF effects including anti-viral state and activation of the acid sphingomyelinase.
