UniprotID	Q8N8N0
Accession	Q8N8N0;B3KV99;Q52LA4
EntryName	RN152_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF152 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 152) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase RNF152)
GeneName	RNF152
Length	203
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that acts as a negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling by mediating ubiquitination of RagA/RRAGA and RHEB (PubMed:25936802, PubMed:30514904). Catalyzes 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RagA/RRAGA in response to amino acid starvation, thereby regulating mTORC1 signaling (PubMed:25936802). Also mediates monoubiquitination of RHEB, promoting its association with the TSC-TBC complex and subsequent inhibition (PubMed:30514904). Also mediates 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination of target proteins and their subsequent targeting to the proteasome for degradation (PubMed:21203937). Induces apoptosis when overexpressed (PubMed:21203937).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane
