UniprotID	O15467
Accession	O15467;Q4KKU0
EntryName	CCL16_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 16 (Chemokine CC-4) (HCC-4) (Chemokine LEC) (IL-10-inducible chemokine) (LCC-1) (Liver-expressed chemokine) (Lymphocyte and monocyte chemoattractant) (LMC) (Monotactin-1) (MTN-1) (NCC-4) (Small-inducible cytokine A16)
GeneName	CCL16 ILINCK NCC4 SCYA16
Length	120
Function	Shows chemotactic activity for lymphocytes and monocytes but not neutrophils. Also shows potent myelosuppressive activity, suppresses proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells. Recombinant SCYA16 shows chemotactic activity for monocytes and THP-1 monocytes, but not for resting lymphocytes and neutrophils. Induces a calcium flux in THP-1 cells that were desensitized by prior expression to RANTES.
