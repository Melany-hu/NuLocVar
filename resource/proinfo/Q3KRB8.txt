UniprotID	Q3KRB8
Accession	Q3KRB8
EntryName	RHGBB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inactive Rho GTPase-activating protein 11B (Rho-type GTPase-activating protein 11B)
GeneName	ARHGAP11B FAM7B1
Length	267
Function	Hominin-specific protein that promotes development and evolutionary expansion of the brain neocortex (PubMed:25721503, PubMed:27957544, PubMed:30484771, PubMed:32554627, PubMed:33938018). Able to promote amplification of basal progenitors in the subventricular zone, producing more neurons during fetal corticogenesis, thereby playing a key role in neocortex expansion (PubMed:25721503). Promotes the proliferation of basal progenitors by inhibiting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP): delays the opening of the mPTP via interaction with ADP:ATP translocase, thereby increasing mitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration and inducing glutamine catabolism, which is required for basal progenitor proliferation (PubMed:31883789). Does not possess GTPase activator activity: the absence of GTPase activator activity is required to promote amplification of basal progenitors during neocortex development (PubMed:25721503, PubMed:27957544).
