UniprotID	Q86UT8
Accession	Q86UT8
EntryName	CATAC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Centrosomal AT-AC splicing factor (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 84)
GeneName	CENATAC CCDC84 DLNB14
Length	332
Function	Component of the minor spliceosome that promotes splicing of a specific, rare minor intron subtype (PubMed:34009673). Negative regulator of centrosome duplication (PubMed:31722219). Constrains centriole number by modulating the degradation of the centrosome-duplication-associated protein SASS6 in an acetylation-dependent manner. SIRT1 deacetylates CENATAC in G1 phase, allowing for SASS6 accumulation on the centrosome and subsequent procentriole assembly. The CENATAC acetylation level is restored in mitosis by NAT10, promoting SASS6 proteasome degradation by facilitating SASS6 binding to APC/C E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex/FZR1 (PubMed:31722219).
