UniprotID	Q86UD5
Accession	Q86UD5;B5ME52;Q6ZMD8;Q96D95
EntryName	SL9B2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium/hydrogen exchanger 9B2 (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHA2) (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger-like domain-containing protein 2) (NHE domain-containing protein 2) (Sodium/hydrogen exchanger-like domain-containing protein 2) (Solute carrier family 9 subfamily B member 2)
GeneName	SLC9B2 NHA2 NHEDC2
Length	537
Function	Electroneutral Na(+) Li(+)/H(+) antiporter that extrudes Na(+) or Li(+) in exchange for external protons across the membrane (PubMed:18000046, PubMed:18508966, PubMed:22948142, PubMed:28154142, PubMed:36177733). Uses the proton gradient/membrane potential to extrude sodium (PubMed:22948142). Contributes to the regulation of intracellular pH and sodium homeostasis (By similarity). Also able to mediate Na(+)/Li(+) antiporter activity in kidney (PubMed:22948142). May play a physiological role in renal tubular function and blood pressure homeostasis (By similarity). Plays an important role for insulin secretion and clathrin-mediated endocytosis in beta-cells (By similarity). Involved in sperm motility and fertility (By similarity). It is controversial whether SLC9B2 plays a role in osteoclast differentiation or not (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Mitochondrion membrane; Endosome membrane; Recycling endosome membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane; Cell projection; Cilium; Flagellum membrane; Basolateral cell membrane; Apical cell membrane
