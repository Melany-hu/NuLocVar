UniprotID	Q96CP7
Accession	Q96CP7;A8MYP9
EntryName	TLCD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	TLC domain-containing protein 1 (Calfacilitin)
GeneName	TLCD1
Length	247
Function	Regulates the composition and fluidity of the plasma membrane (PubMed:30509349). Inhibits the incorporation of membrane-fluidizing phospholipids containing omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) and thereby promotes membrane rigidity (PubMed:30509349). Does not appear to have any effect on LCPUFA synthesis (PubMed:30509349).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
