UniprotID	Q13285
Accession	Q13285;O15196;Q5T6F5
EntryName	STF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) (STF-1) (hSF-1) (Adrenal 4-binding protein) (Fushi tarazu factor homolog 1) (Nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 1) (Steroid hormone receptor Ad4BP)
GeneName	NR5A1 AD4BP FTZF1 SF1
Length	461
Function	Transcriptional activator. Essential for sexual differentiation and formation of the primary steroidogenic tissues (PubMed:27378692). Binds to the Ad4 site found in the promoter region of steroidogenic P450 genes such as CYP11A, CYP11B and CYP21B. Also regulates the AMH/Muellerian inhibiting substance gene as well as the AHCH and STAR genes. 5'-YCAAGGYC-3' and 5'-RRAGGTCA-3' are the consensus sequences for the recognition by NR5A1 (PubMed:27378692). The SFPQ-NONO-NR5A1 complex binds to the CYP17 promoter and regulates basal and cAMP-dependent transcriptional activity. Binds phosphatidylcholine (By similarity). Binds phospholipids with a phosphatidylinositol (PI) headgroup, in particular PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3. Activated by the phosphorylation of NR5A1 by HIPK3 leading to increased steroidogenic gene expression upon cAMP signaling pathway stimulation.
