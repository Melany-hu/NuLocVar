UniprotID	Q9HAB3
Accession	Q9HAB3;A8K6B6;D3DWL8;G1UCY1;Q86UT1
EntryName	S52A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 52, riboflavin transporter, member 2 (Porcine endogenous retrovirus A receptor 1) (PERV-A receptor 1) (Protein GPR172A) (Riboflavin transporter 3) (hRFT3)
GeneName	SLC52A2 GPR172A PAR1 RFT3
Length	445
Function	Plasma membrane transporter mediating the uptake by cells of the water soluble vitamin B2/riboflavin that plays a key role in biochemical oxidation-reduction reactions of the carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism (PubMed:20463145, PubMed:22864630, PubMed:23243084, PubMed:24253200, PubMed:27702554). Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin B2/riboflavin and must obtain it via intestinal absorption (PubMed:20463145). May also act as a receptor for 4-hydroxybutyrate (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
