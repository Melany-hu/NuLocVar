UniprotID	Q9Y6B2
Accession	Q9Y6B2;B2RD11;Q8N7I4;Q9BZT9
EntryName	EID1_HUMAN
ProteinName	EP300-interacting inhibitor of differentiation 1 (21 kDa pRb-associated protein) (CREBBP/EP300 inhibitory protein 1) (E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation 1) (EID-1)
GeneName	EID1 C15orf3 CRI1 RBP21 PNAS-22 PTD014
Length	187
Function	Interacts with RB1 and EP300 and acts as a repressor of MYOD1 transactivation. Inhibits EP300 and CBP histone acetyltransferase activity. May be involved in coupling cell cycle exit to the transcriptional activation of genes required for cellular differentiation. May act as a candidate coinhibitory factor for NR0B2 that can be directly linked to transcription inhibitory mechanisms.
