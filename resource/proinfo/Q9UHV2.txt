UniprotID	Q9UHV2
Accession	Q9UHV2;Q9BUE7
EntryName	SRTD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	SERTA domain-containing protein 1 (CDK4-binding protein p34SEI1) (SEI-1) (p34(SEI-1)) (Transcriptional regulator interacting with the PHD-bromodomain 1) (TRIP-Br1)
GeneName	SERTAD1 SEI1 TRIPBR1
Length	236
Function	Acts at E2F-responsive promoters as coregulator to integrate signals provided by PHD- and/or bromodomain-containing transcription factors. Stimulates E2F1/TFDP1 transcriptional activity. Renders the activity of cyclin D1/CDK4 resistant to the inhibitory effects of CDKN2A/p16INK4A.
