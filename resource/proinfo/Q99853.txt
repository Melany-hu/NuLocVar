EntryName	FOXB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Forkhead box protein B1 (Transcription factor FKH-5)
GeneName	FOXB1 FKH5
Length	325
Function	Transcription factor expressed by neural progenitor cells in specific regions of the embryonic neuroepithelium. Essential for the mammillary nuclei maintenance. Negatively regulates the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitors and promotes oligodendrocyte maturation. Also expressed in mammary glands, plays a role in lactation, controls development of mammary glands and the inferior colliculi of the midbrain in the central nervous system that regulates the milk-ejection reflex.
