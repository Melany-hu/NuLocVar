UniprotID	Q9H765
Accession	Q9H765;A8K1P2;Q547Q2
EntryName	ASB8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 8 (ASB-8)
GeneName	ASB8 PP14212
Length	288
Function	May be a substrate-recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin-Cullin-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Inhibits IFN-beta production through the IRF3 signaling pathway by targeting TBK1 via 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination, leading to its proteasomal degradation (PubMed:32298923).
