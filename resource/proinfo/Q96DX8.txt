UniprotID	Q96DX8
Accession	Q96DX8;Q9H4F3
EntryName	RTP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Receptor-transporting protein 4 (28 kDa interferon-responsive protein) (3CxxC-type zinc finger protein 4)
GeneName	RTP4 IFRG28 Z3CXXC4
Length	246
Function	Probable chaperone protein which facilitates trafficking and functional cell surface expression of some G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Promotes functional expression of the bitter taste receptor TAS2R16 (PubMed:16720576). Also promotes functional expression of the opioid receptor heterodimer OPRD1-OPRM1 (By similarity).
