Function	Regulator of APC activity during mitotic and meiotic cell cycle (PubMed:16921029, PubMed:17234884, PubMed:17485488, PubMed:17875940, PubMed:23708001, PubMed:23708605). During mitotic cell cycle plays a role as both substrate and inhibitor of APC-FZR1 complex (PubMed:16921029, PubMed:17234884, PubMed:17485488, PubMed:17875940, PubMed:23708001, PubMed:23708605, PubMed:29875408). During G1 phase, plays a role as substrate of APC-FZR1 complex E3 ligase (PubMed:29875408). Then switches as an inhibitor of APC-FZR1 complex during S and G2 leading to cell-cycle commitment (PubMed:29875408). As APC inhibitor, prevents the degradation of APC substrates at multiple levels: by interacting with APC and blocking access of APC substrates to the D-box coreceptor, formed by FZR1 and ANAPC10; by suppressing ubiquitin ligation and chain elongation by APC by preventing the UBE2C and UBE2S activities (PubMed:16921029, PubMed:23708001, PubMed:23708605). Plays a role in genome integrity preservation by coordinating DNA replication with mitosis through APC inhibition in interphase to stabilize CCNA2 and GMNN in order to promote mitosis and prevent rereplication and DNA damage-induced cellular senescence (PubMed:17234884, PubMed:17485488, PubMed:17875940). During oocyte maturation, plays a role in meiosis through inactivation of APC-FZR1 complex. Inhibits APC through RPS6KA2 interaction that increases FBXO5 affiniy for CDC20 leading to the metaphase arrest of the second meiotic division before fertilization (By similarity). Controls entry into the first meiotic division through inactivation of APC-FZR1 complex (By similarity). Promotes migration and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (PubMed:29850565).
