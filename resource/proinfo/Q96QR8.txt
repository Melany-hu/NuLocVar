Accession	Q96QR8;A4D2L7
EntryName	PURB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcriptional regulator protein Pur-beta (Purine-rich element-binding protein B)
GeneName	PURB
Length	312
Function	Transcriptional regulator which can act as an activator or a repressor. Represses the transcription of ACTA2 in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells via its ability to interact with the purine-rich strand of a MCAT- containing element in the 5' flanking region of the gene. Represses the transcription of MYOCD, capable of repressing all isoforms of MYOCD but the magnitude of the repressive effects is most notable for the SMC- specific isoforms. Promotes hepatic glucose production by activating the transcription of ADCY6, leading to cAMP accumulation, increased PKA activity, CREB activation, and increased transcription of PCK1 and G6PC genes (By similarity). Has capacity to bind repeated elements in single-stranded DNA such as the purine-rich single strand of the PUR element located upstream of the MYC gene (PubMed:1448097). Participates in transcriptional and translational regulation of alpha-MHC expression in cardiac myocytes by binding to the purine-rich negative regulatory (PNR) element Modulates constitutive liver galectin-3 gene transcription by binding to its promoter. May play a role in the dendritic transport of a subset of mRNAs (By similarity).
