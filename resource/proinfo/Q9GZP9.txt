EntryName	DERL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Derlin-2 (Degradation in endoplasmic reticulum protein 2) (DERtrin-2) (Der1-like protein 2) (F-LAN-1) (F-LANa)
GeneName	DERL2 DER2 FLANA CGI-101 SBBI53
Length	239
Function	Functional component of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) for misfolded lumenal glycoproteins, but not that of misfolded nonglycoproteins. May act by forming a channel that allows the retrotranslocation of misfolded glycoproteins into the cytosol where they are ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. May mediate the interaction between VCP and misfolded glycoproteins (PubMed:16186509, PubMed:16449189). May also be involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced pre-emptive quality control, a mechanism that selectively attenuates the translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and reroutes them to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (PubMed:26565908).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
