UniprotID	Q96CT7
Accession	Q96CT7
EntryName	CC124_HUMAN
ProteinName	Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 124
GeneName	CCDC124
Length	223
Function	Ribosome-binding protein involved in ribosome hibernation: associates with translationally inactive ribosomes and stabilizes the nonrotated conformation of the 80S ribosome, thereby promoting ribosome preservation and storage (PubMed:32687489). Also required for proper progression of late cytokinetic stages (PubMed:23894443).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome; Midbody
