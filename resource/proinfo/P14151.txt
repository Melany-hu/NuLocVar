UniprotID	P14151
Accession	P14151;A0A024R8Z0;B2R6Q8;P15023;Q9UJ43
EntryName	LYAM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	L-selectin (CD62 antigen-like family member L) (Leukocyte adhesion molecule 1) (LAM-1) (Leukocyte surface antigen Leu-8) (Leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1) (LECAM1) (Lymph node homing receptor) (TQ1) (gp90-MEL) (CD antigen CD62L)
GeneName	SELL LNHR LYAM1
Length	372
Function	Calcium-dependent lectin that mediates cell adhesion by binding to glycoproteins on neighboring cells (PubMed:12403782, PubMed:28011641, PubMed:28489325). Mediates the adherence of lymphocytes to endothelial cells of high endothelial venules in peripheral lymph nodes. Promotes initial tethering and rolling of leukocytes in endothelia (PubMed:12403782, PubMed:28011641).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
