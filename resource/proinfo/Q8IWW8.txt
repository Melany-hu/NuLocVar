UniprotID	Q8IWW8
Accession	Q8IWW8;B4DTJ8;Q49A19;Q68CI7;Q6P2B6;Q96MF9
EntryName	HOT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase, mitochondrial (HOT) (EC 1.1.99.24) (Alcohol dehydrogenase iron-containing protein 1) (ADHFe1) (Fe-containing alcohol dehydrogenase)
GeneName	ADHFE1 HMFT2263
Length	467
Function	Catalyzes the cofactor-independent reversible oxidation of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) to succinic semialdehyde (SSA) coupled to reduction of 2-ketoglutarate (2-KG) to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG). D,L-3-hydroxyisobutyrate and L-3-hydroxybutyrate (L-3-OHB) are also substrates for HOT with 10-fold lower activities.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
