EntryName	AMFR_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase AMFR (EC 2.3.2.36) (Autocrine motility factor receptor) (AMF receptor) (RING finger protein 45) (gp78)
GeneName	AMFR RNF45
Length	643
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates the polyubiquitination of lysine and cysteine residues on target proteins, such as CD3D, CYP3A4, CFTR, INSIG1, SOAT2/ACAT2 and APOB for proteasomal degradation (PubMed:10456327, PubMed:11724934, PubMed:12670940, PubMed:19103148, PubMed:24424410, PubMed:28604676). Component of a VCP/p97-AMFR/gp78 complex that participates in the final step of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) (PubMed:10456327, PubMed:11724934, PubMed:19103148, PubMed:24424410). The VCP/p97-AMFR/gp78 complex is involved in the sterol-accelerated ERAD degradation of HMGCR through binding to the HMGCR-INSIG1 complex at the ER membrane (PubMed:16168377, PubMed:22143767). In addition, interaction of AMFR with AUP1 facilitates interaction of AMFR with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2G2 and ubiquitin ligase RNF139, leading to sterol-induced HMGCR ubiquitination (PubMed:23223569). The ubiquitinated HMGCR is then released from the ER into the cytosol for subsequent destruction (PubMed:16168377, PubMed:22143767, PubMed:23223569). In addition to ubiquitination on lysine residues, catalyzes ubiquitination on cysteine residues: together with INSIG1, mediates polyubiquitination of SOAT2/ACAT2 at 'Cys-277', leading to its degradation when the lipid levels are low (PubMed:28604676). Catalyzes ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of INSIG1 when cells are depleted of sterols (PubMed:17043353). Mediates polyubiquitination of INSIG2 at 'Cys-215' in some tissues, leading to its degradation (PubMed:31953408). Also regulates ERAD through the ubiquitination of UBL4A a component of the BAG6/BAT3 complex (PubMed:21636303). Also acts as a scaffold protein to assemble a complex that couples ubiquitination, retranslocation and deglycosylation (PubMed:21636303). Mediates tumor invasion and metastasis as a receptor for the GPI/autocrine motility factor (PubMed:10456327). In association with LMBR1L and UBAC2, negatively regulates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the lymphocytes by promoting the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of CTNNB1 and Wnt receptors FZD6 and LRP6 (PubMed:31073040). Regulates NF-kappa-B and MAPK signaling pathways by mediating 'Lys-27'-linked polyubiquitination of TAB3 and promoting subsequent TAK1/MAP3K7 activation (PubMed:36593296). Required for proper lipid homeostasis (PubMed:37119330).
