UniprotID	Q8NFR3
Accession	Q8NFR3;B2R5D3;D3DNM8;Q0P5S6
EntryName	SPTSB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine palmitoyltransferase small subunit B (Protein ADMP) (Small subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase B) (ssSPTb)
GeneName	SPTSSB ADMP C3orf57 SSSPTB
Length	76
Function	Component of the serine palmitoyltransferase multisubunit enzyme (SPT) that catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid biosynthesis by condensing L-serine and activated acyl-CoA (most commonly palmitoyl-CoA) to form long-chain bases (PubMed:19416851). The SPT complex is composed of SPTLC1, SPTLC2 or SPTLC3 and SPTSSA or SPTSSB. Within this complex, the heterodimer consisting of SPTLC1 and SPTLC2/SPTLC3 forms the catalytic core (PubMed:19416851). Within the SPT complex, SPTSSB stimulates the catalytic activity and plays a role in substrate specificity. SPT complexes with this subunit showing a preference for longer acyl-CoAs. The SPTLC1-SPTLC2-SPTSSB complex shows a strong preference for C18-CoA substrate, while the SPTLC1-SPTLC3-SPTSSB isozyme displays an ability to use a broader range of acyl-CoAs, without apparent preference (PubMed:19416851).
