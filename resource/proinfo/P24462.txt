UniprotID	P24462
Accession	P24462;A4D288;Q9H241
EntryName	CP3A7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 3A7 (EC 1.14.14.1) (CYPIIIA7) (Cytochrome P450-HFLA) (P450HLp2)
GeneName	CYP3A7
Length	503
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of steroid hormones and vitamins during embryogenesis (PubMed:11093772, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:17178770, PubMed:9555064). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:11093772, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847, PubMed:17178770, PubMed:9555064). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Metabolizes 3beta-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one (dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA), a precursor in the biosynthesis of androgen and estrogen steroid hormones (PubMed:17178770, PubMed:9555064). Exhibits high catalytic activity for the formation of hydroxyestrogens from estrone (E1), particularly D-ring hydroxylated estrone at the C16-alpha position (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:14559847). Mainly hydroxylates all trans-retinoic acid (atRA) to 4-hydroxyretinoate and may play a role in atRA clearance during fetal development (PubMed:11093772). Also involved in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics including anticonvulsants (PubMed:9555064).
