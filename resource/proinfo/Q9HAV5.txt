UniprotID	Q9HAV5
Accession	Q9HAV5;Q5VYX9;Q5VYY0;Q6UWM2;Q8IZA6
EntryName	TNR27_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 27 (X-linked ectodysplasin-A2 receptor) (EDA-A2 receptor)
GeneName	EDA2R TNFRSF27 XEDAR UNQ2448/PRO5727/PRO34080
Length	297
Function	Receptor for EDA isoform A2, but not for EDA isoform A1. Mediates the activation of the NF-kappa-B and JNK pathways. Activation seems to be mediated by binding to TRAF3 and TRAF6.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
