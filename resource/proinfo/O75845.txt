EntryName	SC5D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lathosterol oxidase (EC 1.14.19.20) (C-5 sterol desaturase) (Delta(7)-sterol 5-desaturase) (Delta(7)-sterol C5(6)-desaturase) (Lathosterol 5-desaturase) (Sterol-C5-desaturase)
GeneName	SC5D SC5DL
Length	299
Function	Catalyzes the penultimate step of the biosynthesis of cholesterol, the dehydrogenation of lathosterol into 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). Cholesterol is the major sterol component in mammalian membranes and a precursor for bile acid and steroid hormone synthesis (PubMed:10786622, PubMed:38297129). In addition to its essential role in cholesterol biosynthesis, it also indirectly regulates ferroptosis through the production of 7-DHC. By diverting the spread of damage caused by peroxyl radicals from the phospholipid components to its sterol nucleus, 7-DHC prevents this form of cell death (PubMed:38297129, PubMed:38297130).
