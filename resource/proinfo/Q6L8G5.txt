UniprotID	Q6L8G5
Accession	Q6L8G5;B9EHA4
EntryName	KR510_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 5-10 (Keratin-associated protein 5.10) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 5.10)
GeneName	KRTAP5-10 KAP5.10 KRTAP5.10
Length	202
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated protein (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
