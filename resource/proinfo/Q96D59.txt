UniprotID	Q96D59
Accession	Q96D59
EntryName	RN183_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF183 (EC 2.3.2.27)
GeneName	RNF183
Length	192
Function	Acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase catalyzing the covalent attachment of ubiquitin moieties onto substrate proteins (PubMed:29507230). Triggers apoptosis in response to prolonged ER stress by mediating the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of BCL2L1 (PubMed:29507230). May collaborate with FATE1 to restrain BIK protein levels thus regulating apoptotic signaling (PubMed:26567849).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum; Golgi apparatus; cis-Golgi network membrane; Lysosome membrane
