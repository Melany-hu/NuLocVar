UniprotID	P18846
Accession	P18846;B4DRF9;P25168;Q9H4A8
EntryName	ATF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor ATF-1 (cAMP-dependent transcription factor ATF-1) (Activating transcription factor 1) (Protein TREB36)
GeneName	ATF1
Length	271
Function	This protein binds the cAMP response element (CRE) (consensus: 5'-GTGACGT-3'), a sequence present in many viral and cellular promoters. Binds to the Tax-responsive element (TRE) of HTLV-I. Mediates PKA-induced stimulation of CRE-reporter genes. Represses the expression of FTH1 and other antioxidant detoxification genes. Triggers cell proliferation and transformation.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
