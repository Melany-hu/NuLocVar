UniprotID	P32970
Accession	P32970;B4DPR8;Q53XX4;Q96J57
EntryName	CD70_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD70 antigen (CD27 ligand) (CD27-L) (Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 7) (CD antigen CD70)
GeneName	CD70 CD27L CD27LG TNFSF7
Length	193
Function	Expressed at the plasma membrane of B cells, it is the ligand of the CD27 receptor which is specifically expressed at the surface of T cells (PubMed:28011863, PubMed:28011864, PubMed:8387892). The CD70-CD27 signaling pathway mediates antigen-specific T cell activation and expansion which in turn provides immune surveillance of B cells (PubMed:28011863, PubMed:28011864).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
