UniprotID	Q9Y5U9
Accession	Q9Y5U9
EntryName	IR3IP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Immediate early response 3-interacting protein 1
GeneName	IER3IP1 HSPC039
Length	82
Function	Regulator of endoplasmic reticulum secretion that acts as a key determinant of brain size (PubMed:33122427). Required for secretion of extracellular matrix proteins (PubMed:33122427). Required for correct brain development by depositing sufficient extracellular matrix proteins for tissue integrity and the proliferation of neural progenitors (PubMed:33122427). Acts as a regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
