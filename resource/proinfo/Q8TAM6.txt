UniprotID	Q8TAM6
Accession	Q8TAM6;B4DKA6;Q9ULN1
EntryName	ERMIN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ermin (Juxtanodin) (JN)
GeneName	ERMN KIAA1189
Length	284
Function	Plays a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements during the late wrapping and/or compaction phases of myelinogenesis as well as in maintenance and stability of myelin sheath in the adult. May play an important role in late-stage oligodendroglia maturation, myelin/Ranvier node formation during CNS development, and in the maintenance and plasticity of related structures in the mature CNS (By similarity).
