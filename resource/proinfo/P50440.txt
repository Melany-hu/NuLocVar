EntryName	GATM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycine amidinotransferase, mitochondrial (EC 2.1.4.1) (L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase) (Transamidinase)
GeneName	GATM AGAT
Length	423
Function	Transamidinase that catalyzes the transfer of the amidino group of L-arginine onto the amino moiety of acceptor metabolites such as glycine, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and taurine yielding the corresponding guanidine derivatives (PubMed:16820567, PubMed:27233232, PubMed:36543883, PubMed:3800397). Catalyzes the rate-limiting step of creatine biosynthesis, namely the transfer of the amidino group from L-arginine to glycine to generate guanidinoacetate, which is then methylated by GAMT to form creatine. Provides creatine as a source for ATP generation in tissues with high energy demands, in particular skeletal muscle, heart and brain (Probable) (PubMed:27233232, PubMed:36543883, PubMed:3800397, PubMed:9266688).
