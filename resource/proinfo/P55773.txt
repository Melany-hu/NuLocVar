UniprotID	P55773
Accession	P55773;B7ZKQ3;O00174;O75950;Q52LD4
EntryName	CCL23_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 23 (CK-beta-8) (CKB-8) (Macrophage inflammatory protein 3) (MIP-3) (Myeloid progenitor inhibitory factor 1) (MPIF-1) (Small-inducible cytokine A23) [Cleaved into: CCL23(19-99); CCL23(22-99); CCL23(27-99); CCL23(30-99)]
GeneName	CCL23 MIP3 MPIF1 SCYA23
Length	120
Function	Shows chemotactic activity for monocytes, resting T-lymphocytes, and neutrophils, but not for activated lymphocytes. Inhibits proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells in colony formation assays. This protein can bind heparin. Binds CCR1. CCL23(19-99), CCL23(22-99), CCL23(27-99), CCL23(30-99) are more potent chemoattractants than CCL23.
