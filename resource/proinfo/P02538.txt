UniprotID	P02538
Accession	P02538;A4QPC1;P48667;Q08AR4;Q6NT67;Q96CL4
EntryName	K2C6A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 6A (Cytokeratin-6A) (CK-6A) (Cytokeratin-6D) (CK-6D) (Keratin-6A) (K6A) (Type-II keratin Kb6) (allergen Hom s 5)
GeneName	KRT6A K6A KRT6D
Length	564
Function	Epidermis-specific type I keratin involved in wound healing. Involved in the activation of follicular keratinocytes after wounding, while it does not play a major role in keratinocyte proliferation or migration. Participates in the regulation of epithelial migration by inhibiting the activity of SRC during wound repair.
