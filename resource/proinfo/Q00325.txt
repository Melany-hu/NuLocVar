EntryName	S25A3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 25 member 3 (Phosphate carrier protein, mitochondrial) (Phosphate transport protein) (PTP)
GeneName	SLC25A3 PHC OK/SW-cl.48
Length	362
Function	Inorganic ion transporter that transports phosphate or copper ions across the mitochondrial inner membrane into the matrix compartment (By similarity) (PubMed:17273968, PubMed:29237729). Mediates proton-coupled symport of phosphate ions necessary for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP (By similarity) (PubMed:17273968). Transports copper ions probably in the form of anionic copper(I) complexes to maintain mitochondrial matrix copper pool and to supply copper for cytochrome C oxidase complex assembly (PubMed:29237729). May also play a role in regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
