Function	Functions as a scaffold protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathways. Involved in several processes such as innate immune response, inflammation and cell growth inhibition, apoptosis, cell survival, angiogenesis, cell migration and maturation. Also plays a role in cell cycle checkpoint control; reduces G1 phase cyclin levels resulting in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Mediates signal transduction by receptor-mediated inflammatory signals, such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Modulates the balance between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mediated cell survival and apoptosis stimulated kinase (MAP3K5)-JNK signaling pathways; sequesters both AKT1 and MAP3K5 and counterbalances the activity of each kinase by modulating their phosphorylation status in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. Acts as a regulator of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway; specifically involved in transduction of the ER stress-response to the JNK cascade through ERN1. Mediates TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis activation by facilitating dissociation of inhibitor 14-3-3 from MAP3K5; recruits the PP2A phosphatase complex which dephosphorylates MAP3K5 on 'Ser-966', leading to the dissociation of 13-3-3 proteins and activation of the MAP3K5-JNK signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Also mediates TNF/TRAF2-induced MAP3K5-JNK activation, while it inhibits CHUK-NF-kappa-B signaling. Acts a negative regulator in the IFN-gamma-mediated JAK-STAT signaling cascade by inhibiting smooth muscle cell (VSMCs) proliferation and intimal expansion, and thus, prevents graft arteriosclerosis (GA). Acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) and Ras. Promotes hydrolysis of the ARF6-bound GTP and thus, negatively regulates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-dependent TLR4-TIRAP-MyD88 and NF-kappa-B signaling pathways in endothelial cells in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). In response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA), acts as a negative regulator of the VEGFR2-PI3K-mediated angiogenic signaling pathway by inhibiting endothelial cell migration and tube formation. In the developing brain, promotes both the transition from the multipolar to the bipolar stage and the radial migration of cortical neurons from the ventricular zone toward the superficial layer of the neocortex in a glial-dependent locomotion process. Probable downstream effector of the Reelin signaling pathway; promotes Purkinje cell (PC) dendrites development and formation of cerebellar synapses. Also functions as a tumor suppressor protein in prostate cancer progression; prevents cell proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through activation of the glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3B)-induced beta-catenin and inhibition of PI3K-AKT and Ras-MAPK survival downstream signaling cascades, respectively.
