UniprotID	Q99677
Accession	Q99677;B2RAC7;O15132;Q502U9;Q6NSP5
EntryName	LPAR4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 4 (LPA receptor 4) (LPA-4) (G-protein coupled receptor 23) (P2Y purinoceptor 9) (P2Y9) (P2Y5-like receptor) (Purinergic receptor 9)
GeneName	LPAR4 GPR23 LPA4 P2RY9
Length	370
Function	Receptor for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a mediator of diverse cellular activities. Transduces a signal by increasing the intracellular calcium ions and by stimulating adenylyl cyclase activity. The rank order of potency for agonists of this receptor is 1-oleoyl- > 1-stearoyl- > 1-palmitoyl- > 1-myristoyl- > 1-alkyl- > 1-alkenyl-LPA.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
