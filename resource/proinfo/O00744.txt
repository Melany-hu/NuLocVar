UniprotID	O00744
Accession	O00744;B2R7A5;O00747;Q4VAJ4;Q4VAJ5;Q8WZ97
EntryName	WN10B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Wnt-10b (Protein Wnt-12)
GeneName	WNT10B WNT12
Length	389
Function	Member of the Wnt ligand gene family that encodes for secreted proteins, which activate the Wnt signaling cascade. Specifically activates canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and thus triggers beta-catenin/LEF/TCF-mediated transcriptional programs. Involved in signaling networks controlling stemness, pluripotency and cell fate decisions. Acts in the immune system, mammary gland, adipose tissue, bone and skin.
