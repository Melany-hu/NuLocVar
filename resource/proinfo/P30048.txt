EntryName	PRDX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, mitochondrial (EC 1.11.1.24) (Antioxidant protein 1) (AOP-1) (HBC189) (Peroxiredoxin III) (Prx-III) (Peroxiredoxin-3) (Protein MER5 homolog) (Thioredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxin 3)
GeneName	PRDX3 AOP1
Length	256
Function	Thiol-specific peroxidase that catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water and alcohols, respectively. Plays a role in cell protection against oxidative stress by detoxifying peroxides (PubMed:17707404, PubMed:29438714, PubMed:33889951, PubMed:7733872). Acts synergistically with MAP3K13 to regulate the activation of NF-kappa-B in the cytosol (PubMed:12492477). Required for the maintenance of physical strength (By similarity).
