UniprotID	Q8NFW8
Accession	Q8NFW8;Q96AX5;Q9NQZ0
EntryName	NEUA_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.43) (CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase) (CMP-NeuNAc synthase)
GeneName	CMAS
Length	434
Function	Catalyzes the activation of N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuNAc) to cytidine 5'-monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuNAc), a substrate required for the addition of sialic acid. Has some activity toward NeuNAc, N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) or 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN).
