UniprotID	O14880
Accession	O14880;B2R592;Q6ICN4
EntryName	MGST3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutathione S-transferase 3, mitochondrial (GST-3) (EC 2.5.1.-) (Glutathione peroxidase MGST3) (EC 1.11.1.-) (LTC4 synthase MGST3) (EC 4.4.1.20)
GeneName	MGST3
Length	152
Function	Displays both glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase activities toward oxyeicosanoids, as part of cellular detoxification as well as synthesis of bioactive metabolites (PubMed:36370807, PubMed:9278457). Catalyzes conjugate addition of reduced glutathione to the alpha, beta-unsaturated C=C carbonyl group of eisosanoids such as leukotriene A4 and 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 to form GSH adducts relevant to the inflammatory response (PubMed:36370807, PubMed:9278457). Catalyzes glutathione-dependent reduction of eicosanoid peroxides to yield the corresponding eicosanoid hydroxides (PubMed:9278457).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane
