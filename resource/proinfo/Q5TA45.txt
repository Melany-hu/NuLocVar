EntryName	INT11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Integrator complex subunit 11 (Int11) (EC 3.1.27.-) (Cleavage and polyadenylation-specific factor 3-like protein) (CPSF3-like protein) (Protein related to CPSF subunits of 68 kDa) (RC-68)
GeneName	INTS11 CPSF3L RC68
Length	600
Function	RNA endonuclease component of the integrator complex, a multiprotein complex that terminates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription in the promoter-proximal region of genes (PubMed:16239144, PubMed:25201415, PubMed:28396433, PubMed:32697989, PubMed:33243860, PubMed:33548203, PubMed:34762484, PubMed:37080207, PubMed:38570683). The integrator complex provides a quality checkpoint during transcription elongation by driving premature transcription termination of transcripts that are unfavorably configured for transcriptional elongation: the complex terminates transcription by (1) catalyzing dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II subunit POLR2A/RPB1 and SUPT5H/SPT5, (2) degrading the exiting nascent RNA transcript via endonuclease activity and (3) promoting the release of Pol II from bound DNA (PubMed:32697989, PubMed:33243860, PubMed:33548203, PubMed:34762484, PubMed:37080207, PubMed:38570683). The integrator complex is also involved in terminating the synthesis of non-coding Pol II transcripts, such as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), telomerase RNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (PubMed:16239144, PubMed:22252320, PubMed:26308897, PubMed:30737432). Within the integrator complex, INTS11 constitutes the RNA endonuclease subunit that degrades exiting nascent RNA transcripts (PubMed:28396433, PubMed:32697989, PubMed:33243860, PubMed:33548203, PubMed:34762484, PubMed:37080207, PubMed:38570683). Mediates recruitment of cytoplasmic dynein to the nuclear envelope, probably as component of the integrator complex (PubMed:23904267).
