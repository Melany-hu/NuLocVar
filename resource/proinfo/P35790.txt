UniprotID	P35790
Accession	P35790;Q8NE29
EntryName	CHKA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Choline kinase alpha (CK) (EC 2.7.1.32) (CHETK-alpha) (Ethanolamine kinase) (EK) (EC 2.7.1.82)
GeneName	CHKA CHK CKI
Length	457
Function	Plays a key role in phospholipid biosynthesis by catalyzing the phosphorylation of free choline to phosphocholine, the first step in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis (PubMed:17007874, PubMed:19915674, PubMed:23416529, PubMed:34077757). Also phosphorylates ethanolamine, thereby contributing to phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis (PubMed:17007874, PubMed:19915674). Has higher activity with choline (PubMed:17007874, PubMed:19915674). May contribute to tumor cell growth (PubMed:19915674).
