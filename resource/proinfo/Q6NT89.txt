UniprotID	Q6NT89
Accession	Q6NT89
EntryName	TRNP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	TMF-regulated nuclear protein 1
GeneName	TRNP1 C1orf225 TRNP
Length	227
Function	DNA-binding factor that regulates the expression of a subset of genes and plays a key role in tangential, radial, and lateral expansion of the brain neocortex. Regulates neural stem cells proliferation and the production of intermediate neural progenitors and basal radial glial cells affecting the process of cerebral cortex gyrification. May control the proliferation rate of cells by regulating their progression through key cell-cycle transition points (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
