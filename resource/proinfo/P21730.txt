UniprotID	P21730
Accession	P21730
EntryName	C5AR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	C5a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor 1 (C5a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor) (C5a-R) (C5aR) (CD antigen CD88)
GeneName	C5AR1 C5AR C5R1
Length	350
Function	Receptor for the chemotactic and inflammatory peptide anaphylatoxin C5a (PubMed:10636859, PubMed:15153520, PubMed:1847994, PubMed:29300009, PubMed:7622471, PubMed:8182049, PubMed:9553099). The ligand interacts with at least two sites on the receptor: a high-affinity site on the extracellular N-terminus, and a second site in the transmembrane region which activates downstream signaling events (PubMed:7622471, PubMed:8182049, PubMed:9553099). Receptor activation stimulates chemotaxis, granule enzyme release, intracellular calcium release and superoxide anion production (PubMed:10636859, PubMed:15153520).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle
