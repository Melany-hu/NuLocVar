UniprotID	Q13247
Accession	Q13247;B7Z6J3;E1P5W6;Q13244;Q13245;Q96J06;Q9UJB8;Q9Y3N7
EntryName	SRSF6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 6 (Pre-mRNA-splicing factor SRP55) (Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 6)
GeneName	SRSF6 SFRS6 SRP55
Length	344
Function	Plays a role in constitutive splicing and modulates the selection of alternative splice sites. Plays a role in the alternative splicing of MAPT/Tau exon 10. Binds to alternative exons of TNC pre-mRNA and promotes the expression of alternatively spliced TNC. Plays a role in wound healing and in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation via its role in alternative splicing.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleus speckle
