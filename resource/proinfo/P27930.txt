UniprotID	P27930
Accession	P27930;D3DVJ5;Q6LCE6;Q9UE68
EntryName	IL1R2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-1 receptor type 2 (IL-1R-2) (IL-1RT-2) (IL-1RT2) (CD121 antigen-like family member B) (CDw121b) (IL-1 type II receptor) (Interleukin-1 receptor beta) (IL-1R-beta) (Interleukin-1 receptor type II) (CD antigen CD121b) [Cleaved into: Interleukin-1 receptor type 2, membrane form (mIL-1R2) (mIL-1RII); Interleukin-1 receptor type 2, soluble form (sIL-1R2) (sIL-1RII)]
GeneName	IL1R2 IL1RB
Length	398
Function	Non-signaling receptor for IL1A, IL1B and IL1RN. Reduces IL1B activities. Serves as a decoy receptor by competitive binding to IL1B and preventing its binding to IL1R1. Also modulates cellular response through non-signaling association with IL1RAP after binding to IL1B. IL1R2 (membrane and secreted forms) preferentially binds IL1B and poorly IL1A and IL1RN. The secreted IL1R2 recruits secreted IL1RAP with high affinity; this complex formation may be the dominant mechanism for neutralization of IL1B by secreted/soluble receptors.
