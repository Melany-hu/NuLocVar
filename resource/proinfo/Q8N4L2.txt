UniprotID	Q8N4L2
Accession	Q8N4L2;B2R9H4;Q68CU2
EntryName	PP4P2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Type 2 phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase (Type 2 PtdIns-4,5-P2 4-Ptase) (EC 3.1.3.78) (PtdIns-4,5-P2 4-Ptase II) (Transmembrane protein 55A)
GeneName	PIP4P2 TMEM55A
Length	257
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns-4-P) (PubMed:16365287). Does not hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, inositol 3,5-bisphosphate, inositol 3,4-bisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 5-monophosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (PubMed:16365287). Negatively regulates the phagocytosis of large particles by reducing phagosomal phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate accumulation during cup formation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Late endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Phagosome membrane; Cell membrane
