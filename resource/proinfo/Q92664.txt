EntryName	TF3A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor IIIA (TFIIIA)
GeneName	GTF3A
Length	365
Function	Involved in ribosomal large subunit biogenesis. Binds the approximately 50 base pairs internal control region (ICR) of 5S ribosomal RNA genes. It is required for their RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription and may also maintain the transcription of other genes (PubMed:24120868). Also binds the transcribed 5S RNA's (By similarity).
