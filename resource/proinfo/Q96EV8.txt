UniprotID	Q96EV8
Accession	Q96EV8;A8K3V3;Q5THY3;Q5THY4;Q96NV2;Q9H0U2;Q9H3J5
EntryName	DTBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dysbindin (Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 subunit 8) (BLOC-1 subunit 8) (Dysbindin-1) (Dystrobrevin-binding protein 1) (Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 7 protein) (HPS7 protein)
GeneName	DTNBP1 BLOC1S8 My031
Length	351
Function	Component of the BLOC-1 complex, a complex that is required for normal biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LRO), such as platelet dense granules and melanosomes. In concert with the AP-3 complex, the BLOC-1 complex is required to target membrane protein cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals. The BLOC-1 complex, in association with SNARE proteins, is also proposed to be involved in neurite extension. Associates with the BLOC-2 complex to facilitate the transport of TYRP1 independent of AP-3 function. Plays a role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and in neurotransmitter release. Plays a role in the regulation of cell surface exposure of DRD2. May play a role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization and neurite outgrowth. May modulate MAPK8 phosphorylation. Appears to promote neuronal transmission and viability through regulating the expression of SNAP25 and SYN1, modulating PI3-kinase-Akt signaling and influencing glutamatergic release. Regulates the expression of SYN1 through binding to its promoter. Modulates prefrontal cortical activity via the dopamine/D2 pathway.
