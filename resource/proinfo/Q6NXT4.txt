EntryName	ZNT6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc transporter 6 (ZnT-6) (Solute carrier family 30 member 6)
GeneName	SLC30A6 ZNT6
Length	461
Function	Has probably no intrinsic transporter activity but together with SLC30A5 forms a functional zinc ion:proton antiporter heterodimer, mediating zinc entry into the lumen of organelles along the secretory pathway (PubMed:15994300, PubMed:19366695, PubMed:19759014). As part of that zinc ion:proton antiporter, contributes to zinc ion homeostasis within the early secretory pathway and regulates the activation and folding of enzymes like alkaline phosphatases and enzymes involved in phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis (PubMed:15994300, PubMed:19759014, PubMed:35525268).
