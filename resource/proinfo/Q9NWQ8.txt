UniprotID	Q9NWQ8
Accession	Q9NWQ8;A8K1A3;Q2M1Z9;Q5BKU4;Q9NYK0
EntryName	PHAG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains 1 (Csk-binding protein) (Transmembrane adapter protein PAG) (Transmembrane phosphoprotein Cbp)
GeneName	PAG1 CBP PAG
Length	432
Function	Negatively regulates TCR (T-cell antigen receptor)-mediated signaling in T-cells and FCER1 (high affinity immunoglobulin epsilon receptor)-mediated signaling in mast cells. Promotes CSK activation and recruitment to lipid rafts, which results in LCK inhibition. Inhibits immunological synapse formation by preventing dynamic arrangement of lipid raft proteins. May be involved in cell adhesion signaling.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
