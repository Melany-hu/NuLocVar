UniprotID	Q9NTN3
Accession	Q9NTN3;A8K185;B7Z3X2;Q52LU5;Q92548
EntryName	S35D1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleotide sugar transporter SLC35D1 (Solute carrier family 35 member D1) (UDP-galactose transporter-related protein 7) (UGTrel7) (UDP-glucuronic acid/UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine transporter) (UDP-GlcA/UDP-GalNAc transporter)
GeneName	SLC35D1 KIAA0260 UGTREL7
Length	355
Function	Antiporter that transports nucleotide sugars across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane in exchange for either their cognate nucleoside monophosphate or another nucleotide sugar (PubMed:16965264, PubMed:17599910, PubMed:31423530). Transports various UDP-sugars including UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) and UDP-alpha-D-glucuronate (UDP-GlcA), which are used by ER glucosyltransferases as sugar donors for the synthesis of sugar chains of glycoproteins, glycolipids and oligosaccharides (PubMed:11322953, PubMed:16965264, PubMed:17599910, PubMed:17952091, PubMed:31423530). May couple UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GalNAc efflux to UDP-GlcA influx into the ER lumen that in turn stimulates glucuronidation and subsequent excretion of endobiotics and xenobiotics (PubMed:16965264, PubMed:17599910). Plays a role in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis, which is important for formation of cartilage extracellular matrix and normal skeletal development (By similarity).
