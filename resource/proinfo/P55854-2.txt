UniprotID	P55854-2
Accession	P55854;B2R5X4;B4DUW4;Q53HI9;Q6FGD4;Q9BWR4
EntryName	SUMO3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ubiquitin-related modifier 3 (SUMO-3) (SMT3 homolog 1) (SUMO-2) (Ubiquitin-like protein SMT3A) (Smt3A)
GeneName	SUMO3 SMT3A SMT3H1
Length	141
Function	Ubiquitin-like protein which can be covalently attached to target lysines either as a monomer or as a lysine-linked polymer. Does not seem to be involved in protein degradation and may function as an antagonist of ubiquitin in the degradation process. Plays a role in a number of cellular processes such as nuclear transport, DNA replication and repair, mitosis and signal transduction. Covalent attachment to its substrates requires prior activation by the E1 complex SAE1-SAE2 and linkage to the E2 enzyme UBE2I, and can be promoted by an E3 ligase such as PIAS1-4, RANBP2 or CBX4 (PubMed:11451954, PubMed:18538659, PubMed:21965678). Plays a role in the regulation of sumoylation status of SETX (PubMed:24105744).
