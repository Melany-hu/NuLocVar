UniprotID	Q96BJ3
Accession	Q96BJ3;A8K1F0;Q49A81;Q5JRA4;Q658P1;Q9H9E8
EntryName	AIDA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Axin interactor, dorsalization-associated protein (Axin interaction partner and dorsalization antagonist)
GeneName	AIDA C1orf80
Length	306
Function	Acts as a ventralizing factor during embryogenesis. Inhibits axin-mediated JNK activation by binding axin and disrupting axin homodimerization. This in turn antagonizes a Wnt/beta-catenin-independent dorsalization pathway activated by AXIN/JNK-signaling (By similarity).
