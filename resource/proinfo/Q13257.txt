EntryName	MD2L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2A (HsMAD2) (Mitotic arrest deficient 2-like protein 1) (MAD2-like protein 1)
GeneName	MAD2L1 MAD2
Length	205
Function	Component of the spindle-assembly checkpoint that prevents the onset of anaphase until all chromosomes are properly aligned at the metaphase plate (PubMed:15024386, PubMed:29162720). In the closed conformation (C-MAD2) forms a heterotetrameric complex with MAD1L1 at unattached kinetochores during prometaphase, the complex recruits open conformation molecules of MAD2L1 (O-MAD2) and then promotes the conversion of O-MAD2 to C-MAD2 (PubMed:29162720). Required for the execution of the mitotic checkpoint which monitors the process of kinetochore-spindle attachment and inhibits the activity of the anaphase promoting complex by sequestering CDC20 until all chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate (PubMed:10700282, PubMed:11804586, PubMed:15024386).
