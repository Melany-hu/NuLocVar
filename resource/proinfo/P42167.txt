UniprotID	P42167
Accession	P42167;A2T926;Q14861
EntryName	LAP2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lamina-associated polypeptide 2, isoforms beta/gamma (Thymopoietin, isoforms beta/gamma) (TP beta/gamma) (Thymopoietin-related peptide isoforms beta/gamma) (TPRP isoforms beta/gamma) [Cleaved into: Thymopoietin (TP) (Splenin); Thymopentin (TP5)]
GeneName	TMPO LAP2
Length	454
Function	May help direct the assembly of the nuclear lamina and thereby help maintain the structural organization of the nuclear envelope. Possible receptor for attachment of lamin filaments to the inner nuclear membrane. May be involved in the control of initiation of DNA replication through its interaction with NAKAP95.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus inner membrane; Cytoplasm
