UniprotID	Q9NR23
Accession	Q9NR23;Q8NEJ4
EntryName	GDF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Growth/differentiation factor 3 (GDF-3)
GeneName	GDF3 UNQ222/PRO248
Length	364
Function	Growth factor involved in early embryonic development and adipose-tissue homeostasis. During embryogenesis controls formation of anterior visceral endoderm and mesoderm and the establishment of anterior-posterior identity through a receptor complex comprising the receptor ACVR1B and the coreceptor CRIPTO (By similarity). Regulates adipose-tissue homeostasis and energy balance under nutrient overload in part by signaling through the receptor complex based on ACVR1C and CRIPTO/Cripto (PubMed:21805089).
