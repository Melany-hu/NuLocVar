UniprotID	Q8WU68-3
Accession	Q8WU68;A6NKI8;Q56UU3
EntryName	U2AF4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Splicing factor U2AF 26 kDa subunit (U2 auxiliary factor 26) (U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1-like protein 4) (U2AF1-like 4) (U2(RNU2) small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1-like protein 3) (U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1-like protein 3) (U2AF1-like protein 3)
GeneName	U2AF1L4 U2AF1-RS3 U2AF1L3
Length	181
Function	RNA-binding protein that function as a pre-mRNA splicing factor. Plays a critical role in both constitutive and enhancer-dependent splicing by mediating protein-protein interactions and protein-RNA interactions required for accurate 3'-splice site selection. Acts by enhancing the binding of U2AF2 to weak pyrimidine tracts. Also participates in the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Activates exon 5 skipping of PTPRC during T-cell activation; an event reversed by GFI1. Binds to RNA at the AG dinucleotide at the 3'-splice site (By similarity). Shows a preference for AGC or AGA (By similarity).
