UniprotID	Q9H920
Accession	Q9H920;B3KSW8;Q6IA57;Q6P449;Q96DB4
EntryName	RN121_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF121 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 121)
GeneName	RNF121
Length	327
Function	E3 ubiquitin ligase which accepts ubiquitin and transfers it to substrates thereby promoting their degradation by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway which is a pathway involved in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins (By similarity). May regulate the unfolded protein response to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
