UniprotID	Q9BTL3
Accession	Q9BTL3;Q2M1J8
EntryName	RAMAC_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA guanine-N7 methyltransferase activating subunit (Protein FAM103A1) (RNA guanine-7 methyltransferase activating subunit) (RNMT-activating mRNA cap methyltransferase subunit) (RNMT-activating mini protein) (RAM)
GeneName	RAMAC C15orf18 FAM103A1 RAMMET
Length	118
Function	Regulatory subunit of the mRNA-capping methyltransferase RNMT:RAMAC complex that methylates the N7 position of the added guanosine to the 5'-cap structure of mRNAs (PubMed:22099306, PubMed:27422871). Promotes the recruitment of the methyl donor, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, to RNMT (PubMed:27422871). Regulates RNMT expression by a post-transcriptional stabilizing mechanism (PubMed:22099306). Binds RNA (PubMed:22099306).
