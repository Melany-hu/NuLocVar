UniprotID	Q9H3Z7
Accession	Q9H3Z7
EntryName	ABHGB_HUMAN
ProteinName	ABHD16B (EC 3.1.1.111) (Alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 16B) (Abhydrolase domain-containing protein 16B)
GeneName	ABHD16B C20orf135
Length	469
Function	Hydrolyzes the sn-1 position of glycerophospholipids with high specificity towards phosphatidylserine (PS), PS-PLA1 enzyme (PubMed:36841071). Also hydrolyzes the acyl chain of glycerolipids with a preference for the monoacylglycerol (MAG) 1-acylglycerol, MAG lipase (PubMed:36841071). Plays a regulatory role in cellular lipid homeostasis by modulating genes involved in neutral lipid degradation and in phospholipid synthesis and composition (PubMed:37944658).
