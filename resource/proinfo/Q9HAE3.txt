UniprotID	Q9HAE3
Accession	Q9HAE3;B4DSB4;E7EVN7
EntryName	CLXN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calaxin (EF-hand calcium-binding domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	CLXN EFCAB1 ODAD5
Length	211
Function	Component of the outer dynein arm-docking complex (ODA-DC) that mediates outer dynein arms (ODA) binding onto the doublet microtubule. Seems to regulate the assembly of both ODAs and their axonemal docking complex onto ciliary microtubules (By similarity). Regulates ciliary and flagellar motility and is required for cilia-driven determination of body laterality (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium axoneme; Cell projection; Cilium; Cell projection; Cilium; Flagellum
