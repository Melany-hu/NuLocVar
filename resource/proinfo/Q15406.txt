Accession	Q15406;O00551;O00603;Q5T6F4;Q8NHQ0;Q92898;Q99802
EntryName	NR6A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear receptor subfamily 6 group A member 1 (Germ cell nuclear factor) (GCNF) (hGCNF) (Retinoid receptor-related testis-specific receptor) (RTR) (hRTR)
GeneName	NR6A1 GCNF
Length	480
Function	Orphan nuclear receptor that binds to a response element containing the sequence 5'-TCAAGGTCA-3' (PubMed:26769970). Acts as a regulator of embryonic stem cell pluripotency by mediating repression of POU5F1/OCT4: binds to the DR0 element within the POU5F1/OCT4 promoter and inhibits POU5F1/OCT4 expression during embryonic stem cell differentiation (PubMed:26769970). Involved in the regulation of gene expression in germ cell development during gametogenesis (By similarity).
