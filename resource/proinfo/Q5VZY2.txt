Accession	Q5VZY2;A2RU82;Q08EQ2;Q0IIP2;Q495B4;Q5VZY1
EntryName	PLPP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholipid phosphatase 4 (EC 3.1.3.4) (EC 3.6.1.75) (Phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 domain-containing protein 1A)
GeneName	PLPP4 DPPL2 PPAPDC1 PPAPDC1A
Length	271
Function	Magnesium-independent phospholipid phosphatase with broad substrate specificity (PubMed:17590538). Preferentially catalyzes the conversion of diacylglycerol pyrophosphate into phosphatidate but can also act on phosphatidate and lysophosphatidate (PubMed:17590538). Phospholipid phosphatases are involved in both the synthesis of lipids and the degradation or generation of lipid-signaling molecules like diacylglycerol (PubMed:28851360).
