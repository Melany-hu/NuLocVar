UniprotID	O75886
Accession	O75886;A8K8A0;D3DPA1;Q7LDQ0;Q9UF58
EntryName	STAM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal transducing adapter molecule 2 (STAM-2) (Hrs-binding protein)
GeneName	STAM2 HBP
Length	525
Function	Involved in intracellular signal transduction mediated by cytokines and growth factors. Upon IL-2 and GM-CSL stimulation, it plays a role in signaling leading to DNA synthesis and MYC induction. May also play a role in T-cell development. Involved in down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase via multivesicular body (MVBs) when complexed with HGS (ESCRT-0 complex). The ESCRT-0 complex binds ubiquitin and acts as a sorting machinery that recognizes ubiquitinated receptors and transfers them to further sequential lysosomal sorting/trafficking processes (By similarity).
