UniprotID	P49682
Accession	P49682;B2R982;O15185;Q7Z710;Q9P2T4;Q9P2T5
EntryName	CXCR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-X-C chemokine receptor type 3 (CXC-R3) (CXCR-3) (CKR-L2) (G protein-coupled receptor 9) (Interferon-inducible protein 10 receptor) (IP-10 receptor) (CD antigen CD183)
GeneName	CXCR3 GPR9
Length	368
Function	Receptor for the C-X-C chemokine CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 and mediates the proliferation, survival and angiogenic activity of human mesangial cells (HMC) through a heterotrimeric G-protein signaling pathway (PubMed:12782716). Binds to CCL21. Probably promotes cell chemotaxis response. Upon activation by PF4, induces activated T-lymphocytes migration mediated via downstream Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell membrane
