UniprotID	O95755
Accession	O95755;Q2M390;Q7Z4A9;Q9UHP5
EntryName	RAB36_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-36 (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB36
Length	267
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion.
