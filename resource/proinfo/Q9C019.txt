EntryName	TRI15_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM15 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 93) (Zinc finger protein 178) (Zinc finger protein B7)
GeneName	TRIM15 RNF93 ZNF178 ZNFB7
Length	465
Function	E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a role in several processes including innate antiviral immnity, cell migration and chemotaxis (PubMed:23077300, PubMed:34142270). Acts as a 'Lys-63'-specific ubiquitin ligase for MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1, promoting their activation by facilitating their interaction with MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 (PubMed:34497368). Also plays a role in cell migration and chemotaxis by acting as a stable focal adhesion component upon recruitment by multi-adapter protein paxillin/PXN (PubMed:25015296). Functions in the RIGI-mediated interferon induction pathway upstream or at the level of MAVS (PubMed:23077300). Inhibits NF-kappa-B activation by turnover of 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of MAP3K7/TAK1. Mechanistically, prevents TRIM8 cytoplasmic translocation and thus inhibits TRIM8-mediated 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of MAP3K7/TAK1 in the cytoplasm (PubMed:34871740). Also plays an important regulatory effect on the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs).
