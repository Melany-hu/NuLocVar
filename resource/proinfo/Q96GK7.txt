UniprotID	Q96GK7
Accession	Q96GK7;Q9Y3B0
EntryName	FAH2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Oxaloacetate tautomerase FAHD2A, mitochondrial (EC 5.3.2.2) (Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase domain-containing protein 2A)
GeneName	FAHD2A CGI-105
Length	314
Function	Tautomerase that converts enol-oxaloacetate, a strong inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, to the physiological keto form of oxaloacetate (PubMed:38287013). It is thereby required to maximize aerobic respiration efficiency by preventing succinate dehydrogenase inhibition (PubMed:38287013).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
