UniprotID	P53677
Accession	P53677;B2RCR0;D3DSY2;Q7Z472
EntryName	AP3M2_HUMAN
ProteinName	AP-3 complex subunit mu-2 (Adaptor-related protein complex 3 subunit mu-2) (Clathrin assembly protein assembly protein complex 3 mu-2 medium chain) (Clathrin coat assembly protein AP47 homolog 2) (Clathrin coat-associated protein AP47 homolog 2) (Golgi adaptor AP-1 47 kDa protein homolog 2) (HA1 47 kDa subunit homolog 2) (Mu3B-adaptin) (P47B)
GeneName	AP3M2
Length	418
Function	Part of the AP-3 complex, an adaptor-related complex which is not clathrin-associated. The complex is associated with the Golgi region as well as more peripheral structures. It facilitates the budding of vesicles from the Golgi membrane and may be directly involved in trafficking to lysosomes. In concert with the BLOC-1 complex, AP-3 is required to target cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane
