UniprotID	Q16795
Accession	Q16795;Q14076;Q2NKX0
EntryName	NDUA9_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 9, mitochondrial (Complex I-39kD) (CI-39kD) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 39 kDa subunit)
GeneName	NDUFA9 NDUFS2L
Length	377
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Required for proper complex I assembly (PubMed:28671271). Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
