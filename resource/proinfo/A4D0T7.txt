UniprotID	A4D0T7
Accession	A4D0T7;Q32Q38
EntryName	SIM30_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small integral membrane protein 30 (Microprotein in antiviral immunity 1)
GeneName	SMIM30 MAVI1
Length	59
Function	Negatively regulates antiviral innate immune responses (PubMed:37656786). Disrupts the interaction of antiviral protein MAVS with innate immune receptor RIGI and inhibits MAVS aggregation, resulting in the repression of type I interferon signaling and innate immune responses (PubMed:37656786).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Mitochondrion membrane
