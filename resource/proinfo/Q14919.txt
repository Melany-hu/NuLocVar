UniprotID	Q14919
Accession	Q14919;Q13448
EntryName	NC2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dr1-associated corepressor (Dr1-associated protein 1) (Negative cofactor 2-alpha) (NC2-alpha)
GeneName	DRAP1
Length	205
Function	The association of the DR1/DRAP1 heterodimer with TBP results in a functional repression of both activated and basal transcription of class II genes. This interaction precludes the formation of a transcription-competent complex by inhibiting the association of TFIIA and/or TFIIB with TBP. Can bind to DNA on its own.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
