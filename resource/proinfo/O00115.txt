UniprotID	O00115
Accession	O00115;B2RD06;B7Z4K6;O43910
EntryName	DNS2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deoxyribonuclease-2-alpha (EC 3.1.22.1) (Acid DNase) (Deoxyribonuclease II alpha) (DNase II alpha) (Lysosomal DNase II) (R31240_2)
GeneName	DNASE2 DNASE2A DNL2
Length	360
Function	Hydrolyzes DNA under acidic conditions with a preference for double-stranded DNA. Plays a major role in the clearance of nucleic acids generated through apoptosis, hence preventing autoinflammation (PubMed:29259162, PubMed:31775019). Necessary for proper fetal development and for definitive erythropoiesis in fetal liver and bone marrow, where it degrades nuclear DNA expelled from erythroid precursor cells (PubMed:29259162).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome
