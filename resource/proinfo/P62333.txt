UniprotID	P62333
Accession	P62333;B2R975;P49719;Q6IBU3;Q92524
EntryName	PRS10_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome regulatory subunit 10B (26S proteasome AAA-ATPase subunit RPT4) (Proteasome 26S subunit ATPase 6) (Proteasome subunit p42)
GeneName	PSMC6 SUG2
Length	389
Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair. PSMC6 belongs to the heterohexameric ring of AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) proteins that unfolds ubiquitinated target proteins that are concurrently translocated into a proteolytic chamber and degraded into peptides.
