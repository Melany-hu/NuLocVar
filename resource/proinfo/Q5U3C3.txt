UniprotID	Q5U3C3
Accession	Q5U3C3;B3KSQ8;F5H2P2
EntryName	TM164_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 164 (Arachidonoyl ether phospholipid synthase)
GeneName	TMEM164
Length	297
Function	Positive regulator of ferroptosis (PubMed:35947500, PubMed:36782012). Involved in the acylation of ether lysophospholipids with the arachidonoyl chain (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoyl; C20:4) of diacylglycerophospholipids, generating C20:4 ether glycerophospholipids (ePEs) such as 1-(1Z-octadecenyl)-2-(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE (P-18:0/20:4)), which promotes ferroptosis (PubMed:36782012). Selectively mediates ATG5-dependent autophagosome formation during ferroptosis, rather than during starvation, and regulates the degradation of ferritin, GPX4 and lipid droplets to increase iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, thereby promoting ferroptotic cell death (PubMed:35947500).
