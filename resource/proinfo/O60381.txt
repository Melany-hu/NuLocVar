UniprotID	O60381
Accession	O60381;B3KVB7;Q8TBM1;Q8TE93;Q96AJ2
EntryName	HBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	HMG box-containing protein 1 (HMG box transcription factor 1) (High mobility group box transcription factor 1)
GeneName	HBP1
Length	514
Function	Transcriptional repressor that binds to the promoter region of target genes. Plays a role in the regulation of the cell cycle and of the Wnt pathway. Binds preferentially to the sequence 5'-TTCATTCATTCA-3'. Binding to the histone H1.0 promoter is enhanced by interaction with RB1. Disrupts the interaction between DNA and TCF4.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
