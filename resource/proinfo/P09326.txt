UniprotID	P09326
Accession	P09326;Q5U055;Q8MGR0
EntryName	CD48_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD48 antigen (B-lymphocyte activation marker BLAST-1) (BCM1 surface antigen) (Leukocyte antigen MEM-102) (SLAM family member 2) (SLAMF2) (Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule 2) (TCT.1) (CD antigen CD48)
GeneName	CD48 BCM1 BLAST1
Length	243
Function	Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface glycoprotein that interacts via its N-terminal immunoglobulin domain with cell surface receptors including CD244/2B4 or CD2 to regulate immune cell function and activation (PubMed:12007789, PubMed:19494291, PubMed:27249817, PubMed:9841922). Participates in T-cell signaling transduction by associating with CD2 and efficiently bringing the Src family protein kinase LCK and LAT to the TCR/CD3 complex (PubMed:19494291). In turn, promotes LCK phosphorylation and subsequent activation (PubMed:12007789). Induces the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic immunoreceptortyrosine switch motifs (ITSMs) of CD244 initiating a series of signaling events that leads to the generation of the immunological synapse and the directed release of cytolytic granules containing perforin and granzymes by T-lymphocytes and NK-cells (PubMed:27249817).
