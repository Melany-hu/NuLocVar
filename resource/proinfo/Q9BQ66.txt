UniprotID	Q9BQ66
Accession	Q9BQ66;A3KMC5;Q495I0
EntryName	KR412_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 4-12 (Keratin-associated protein 4.12) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 4.12)
GeneName	KRTAP4-12 KAP4.12 KRTAP4.12
Length	201
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
