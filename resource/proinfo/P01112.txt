UniprotID	P01112
Accession	P01112;B5BUA0;Q14080;Q6FHV9;Q9BR65;Q9UCE2
EntryName	RASH_HUMAN
ProteinName	GTPase HRas (EC 3.6.5.2) (H-Ras-1) (Ha-Ras) (Transforming protein p21) (c-H-ras) (p21ras) [Cleaved into: GTPase HRas, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	HRAS HRAS1
Length	189
Function	Involved in the activation of Ras protein signal transduction (PubMed:22821884). Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (PubMed:12740440, PubMed:14500341, PubMed:9020151).
