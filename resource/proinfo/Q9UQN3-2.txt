UniprotID	Q9UQN3-2
Accession	Q9UQN3;B4DJG8;Q53HC7;Q9Y4U6
EntryName	CHM2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Charged multivesicular body protein 2b (CHMP2.5) (Chromatin-modifying protein 2b) (CHMP2b) (Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 2-2) (Vps2-2) (hVps2-2)
GeneName	CHMP2B CGI-84
Length	172
Function	Probable core component of the endosomal sorting required for transport complex III (ESCRT-III) which is involved in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4.
