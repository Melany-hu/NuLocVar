EntryName	GRHL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Grainyhead-like protein 1 homolog (Mammalian grainyhead) (NH32) (Transcription factor CP2-like 2) (Transcription factor LBP-32)
GeneName	GRHL1 LBP32 MGR TFCP2L2
Length	618
Function	Transcription factor involved in epithelial development. Binds directly to the consensus DNA sequence 5'-AACCGGTT-3' (PubMed:12175488, PubMed:18288204, PubMed:29309642). Important regulator of DSG1 in the context of hair anchorage and epidermal differentiation, participates in the maintenance of the skin barrier. There is no genetic interaction with GRHL3, nor functional cooperativity due to diverse target gene selectivity during epithelia development (By similarity). May play a role in regulating glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling.
