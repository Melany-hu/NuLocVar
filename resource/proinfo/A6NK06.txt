EntryName	IRG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cis-aconitate decarboxylase (CAD) (EC 4.1.1.6) (Aconitate decarboxylase) (Aconitate decarboxylase 1) (Cis-aconitic acid decarboxylase) (Immune-responsive gene 1 protein)
GeneName	ACOD1 IRG1
Length	481
Function	Cis-aconitate decarboxylase that catalyzes production of itaconate and is involved in the inhibition of the inflammatory response (PubMed:23609450, PubMed:23610393, PubMed:31548418, PubMed:35662396). Acts as a negative regulator of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-mediated inflammatory innate response by stimulating the tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein TNFAIP3 expression via reactive oxygen species (ROS) in LPS-tolerized macrophages (PubMed:23609450). Involved in antimicrobial response of innate immune cells; ACOD1-mediated itaconic acid production contributes to the antimicrobial activity of macrophages by generating itaconate, leading to alkylation of proteins, such as TFEB (PubMed:23610393, PubMed:35662396). Involved in antiviral response following infection by flavivirus in neurons: ACOD1-mediated itaconate production inhibits the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, generating a metabolic state in neurons that suppresses replication of viral genomes (By similarity). Plays a role in the embryo implantation (By similarity).
