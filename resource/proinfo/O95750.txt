UniprotID	O95750
Accession	O95750
EntryName	FGF19_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF-19)
GeneName	FGF19 UNQ334/PRO533
Length	216
Function	Involved in the suppression of bile acid biosynthesis through down-regulation of CYP7A1 expression, following positive regulation of the JNK and ERK1/2 cascades. Stimulates glucose uptake in adipocytes. Activity requires the presence of KLB and FGFR4.
