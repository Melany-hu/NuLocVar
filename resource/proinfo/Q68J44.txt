UniprotID	Q68J44
Accession	Q68J44;B2RP93
EntryName	DUS29_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity phosphatase 29 (Dual specificity phosphatase 27) (Dual specificity phosphatase DUPD1) (EC 3.1.3.16, EC 3.1.3.48)
GeneName	DUSP29 DUPD1 DUSP27
Length	220
Function	Dual specificity phosphatase able to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues within the same substrate, with a preference for phosphotyrosine as a substrate (PubMed:17498703). Involved in the modulation of intracellular signaling cascades. In skeletal muscle regulates systemic glucose homeostasis by activating, AMPK, an energy sensor protein kinase (By similarity). Affects MAP kinase signaling though modulation of the MAPK1/2 cascade in skeletal muscle promoting muscle cell differentiation, development and atrophy (By similarity).
