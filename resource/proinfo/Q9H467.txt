UniprotID	Q9H467
Accession	Q9H467;D3DR88;Q9BWG8
EntryName	CUED2_HUMAN
ProteinName	CUE domain-containing protein 2
GeneName	CUEDC2 C10orf66 HOYS6
Length	287
Function	Down-regulates ESR1 protein levels through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway, regardless of the presence of 17 beta-estradiol. Also involved in 17 beta-estradiol-induced ESR1 degradation. Controls PGR protein levels through a similar mechanism.
