Accession	P62701;P12631;P12750;P27576;P55831;Q14727;Q6IPY4
EntryName	RS4X_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein eS4, X isoform (40S ribosomal protein S4) (SCR10) (Single copy abundant mRNA protein)
GeneName	RPS4X CCG2 RPS4 SCAR
Length	263
Function	Component of the small ribosomal subunit. The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:23636399). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
