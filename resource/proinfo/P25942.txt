UniprotID	P25942
Accession	P25942;E1P5S9;Q53GN5;Q5JY15;Q5U007;Q7M4Q8;Q86YK5;Q9BYU0
EntryName	TNR5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 5 (B-cell surface antigen CD40) (Bp50) (CD40L receptor) (CDw40) (CD antigen CD40)
GeneName	CD40 TNFRSF5
Length	277
Function	Receptor for TNFSF5/CD40LG (PubMed:31331973). Transduces TRAF6- and MAP3K8-mediated signals that activate ERK in macrophages and B cells, leading to induction of immunoglobulin secretion (By similarity).
