ProteinName	U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein NOL7 (U3 snoRNA-associated protein NOL7) (Nucleolar protein 7) (Nucleolar protein of 27 kDa)
GeneName	NOL7 C6orf90 NOP27
Length	257
Function	Functions as part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit that coordinates the first two steps of ribosome biogenesis in transcription of the primary transcript pre-RNA and pre-18S processing (PubMed:34516797, PubMed:37246770). During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797). This subunit is required for processing of the 5'-external transcribed spacer sequence (5'ETS) of the primary transcript pre-rRNA to yield the 18S rRNA (PubMed:37246770). Also plays a role in maintaining early pre-rRNA levels, either by assisting in its transcription or stability (PubMed:37246770).
