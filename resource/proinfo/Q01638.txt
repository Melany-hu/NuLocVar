ProteinName	Interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 (EC 3.2.2.6) (Protein ST2)
GeneName	IL1RL1 DER4 ST2 T1
Length	556
Function	Receptor for interleukin-33 (IL-33) which plays crucial roles in innate and adaptive immunity, contributing to tissue homeostasis and responses to environmental stresses together with coreceptor IL1RAP (PubMed:35238669). Its stimulation recruits MYD88, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6, followed by phosphorylation of MAPK3/ERK1 and/or MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK14, and MAPK8. Possibly involved in helper T-cell function (Probable) (PubMed:16286016). Upon tissue injury, induces UCP2-dependent mitochondrial rewiring that attenuates the generation of reactive oxygen species and preserves the integrity of Krebs cycle required for persistent production of itaconate and subsequent GATA3-dependent differentiation of inflammation-resolving alternatively activated macrophages (By similarity).
