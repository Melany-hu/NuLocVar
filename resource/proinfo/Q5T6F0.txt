EntryName	DCA12_HUMAN
ProteinName	DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 12 (Centrosome-related protein TCC52) (Testis cancer centrosome-related protein) (WD repeat-containing protein 40A)
GeneName	DCAF12 KIAA1892 TCC52 WDR40A
Length	453
Function	Substrate-recognition component of a DCX (DDB1-CUL4-X-box) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex of the DesCEND (destruction via C-end degrons) pathway, which recognizes a C-degron located at the extreme C terminus of target proteins, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:16949367, PubMed:16964240, PubMed:29779948). The C-degron recognized by the DesCEND pathway is usually a motif of less than ten residues and can be present in full-length proteins, truncated proteins or proteolytically cleaved forms (PubMed:29779948). The DCX(DCAF12) complex specifically recognizes proteins with a diglutamate (Glu-Glu) at the C-terminus, such as MAGEA3, MAGEA6 and CCT5, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:29779948, PubMed:31267705). Ubiquitination of MAGEA3, MAGEA6 by DCX(DCAF12) complex is required for starvation-induced autophagy (PubMed:31267705). Also directly recognizes the C-terminal glutamate-leucine (Glu-Leu) degron as an alternative degron in proteins such as MOV10, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation. Controls the protein level of MOV10 during spermatogenesis and in T cells, especially after their activation (PubMed:34065512).
