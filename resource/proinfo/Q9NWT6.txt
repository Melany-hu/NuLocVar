UniprotID	Q9NWT6
Accession	Q9NWT6;D3DR69;Q5W147;Q969Q7;Q9NPV5
EntryName	HIF1N_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha inhibitor (EC 1.14.11.30) (EC 1.14.11.n4) (Factor inhibiting HIF-1) (FIH-1) (Hypoxia-inducible factor asparagine hydroxylase)
GeneName	HIF1AN FIH1
Length	349
Function	Hydroxylates HIF-1 alpha at 'Asn-803' in the C-terminal transactivation domain (CAD). Functions as an oxygen sensor and, under normoxic conditions, the hydroxylation prevents interaction of HIF-1 with transcriptional coactivators including Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator. Involved in transcriptional repression through interaction with HIF1A, VHL and histone deacetylases. Hydroxylates specific Asn residues within ankyrin repeat domains (ARD) of NFKB1, NFKBIA, NOTCH1, ASB4, PPP1R12A and several other ARD-containing proteins. Also hydroxylates Asp and His residues within ARDs of ANK1 and TNKS2, respectively. Negatively regulates NOTCH1 activity, accelerating myogenic differentiation. Positively regulates ASB4 activity, promoting vascular differentiation.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region
