UniprotID	Q99518
Accession	Q99518;Q5EBX4;Q86U73;Q9BRX1
EntryName	FMO2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Flavin-containing monooxygenase 2 (EC 1.14.13.-) (Dimethylaniline oxidase 2) (FMO 1B1) (Pulmonary flavin-containing monooxygenase 2) (FMO 2)
GeneName	FMO2
Length	535
Function	Catalyzes the oxidative metabolism of numerous xenobiotics, including mainly therapeutic drugs and insecticides that contain a soft nucleophile, most commonly nitrogen and sulfur and participates to their bioactivation (PubMed:15144220, PubMed:15294458, PubMed:18930751, PubMed:18948378, PubMed:9804831). Specifically catalyzes S-oxygenation of sulfur derived compounds such as thioureas-derived compounds, thioetherorganophosphates to their sulfenic acid (PubMed:15144220, PubMed:9804831). In vitro, catalyzes S-oxygenation of the second-line antitubercular drugs thiacetazone (TAZ) and ethionamide (ETA), forming a sulfinic acid and a carbodiimide via a postulated sulfenic acid intermediate (PubMed:18930751, PubMed:18948378). Also catalyzes S-oxygenation of the thioether-containing organophosphate insecticides, phorate and disulfoton (PubMed:15294458).
