UniprotID	Q15631
Accession	Q15631;B7Z3X8;Q5U0K7
EntryName	TSN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Translin (EC 3.1.-.-) (Component 3 of promoter of RISC) (C3PO)
GeneName	TSN
Length	228
Function	DNA-binding protein that specifically recognizes consensus sequences at the breakpoint junctions in chromosomal translocations, mostly involving immunoglobulin (Ig)/T-cell receptor gene segments. Seems to recognize single-stranded DNA ends generated by staggered breaks occurring at recombination hot spots.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus
