UniprotID	O75344
Accession	O75344;B4DXT7;G3V0I2;Q7Z4T4;Q9UDS0
EntryName	FKBP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inactive peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP6 (Inactive PPIase FKBP6) (36 kDa FK506-binding protein) (36 kDa FKBP) (FKBP-36) (FK506-binding protein 6) (FKBP-6) (Immunophilin FKBP36)
GeneName	FKBP6 FKBP36
Length	327
Function	Has an essential role in spermatogenesis (PubMed:36150389). It is required to repress transposable elements and prevent their mobilization, which is essential for the germline integrity (By similarity). Acts via the piRNA metabolic process, which mediates the repression of transposable elements during meiosis by forming complexes composed of piRNAs and Piwi proteins and govern the methylation and subsequent repression of transposons (By similarity). Acts as a co-chaperone via its interaction with HSP90 and is required for the piRNA amplification process, the secondary piRNA biogenesis (By similarity). May be required together with HSP90 in removal of 16 nucleotide ping-pong by-products from Piwi complexes, possibly facilitating turnover of Piwi complexes (By similarity).
