UniprotID	P08913
Accession	P08913;B0LPF6;Q2I8G2;Q2XN99;Q86TH8;Q9BZK1
EntryName	ADA2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-2A adrenergic receptor (Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor subtype C10) (Alpha-2A adrenoreceptor) (Alpha-2A adrenoceptor) (Alpha-2AAR)
GeneName	ADRA2A ADRA2R ADRAR
Length	465
Function	Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors mediate the catecholamine-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase through the action of G proteins. The rank order of potency for agonists of this receptor is oxymetazoline > clonidine > epinephrine > norepinephrine > phenylephrine > dopamine > p-synephrine > p-tyramine > serotonin = p-octopamine. For antagonists, the rank order is yohimbine > phentolamine = mianserine > chlorpromazine = spiperone = prazosin > propanolol > alprenolol = pindolol.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
