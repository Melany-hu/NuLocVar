UniprotID	Q8N1L9-2
Accession	Q8N1L9;D9IC56;Q8NAF4;Q8NAL8;Q96EH4
EntryName	BATF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor ATF-like 2 (B-ATF-2) (Suppressor of AP-1 regulated by IFN) (SARI)
GeneName	BATF2
Length	189
Function	AP-1 family transcription factor that controls the differentiation of lineage-specific cells in the immune system. Following infection, participates in the differentiation of CD8(+) thymic conventional dendritic cells in the immune system. Acts via the formation of a heterodimer with JUN family proteins that recognizes and binds DNA sequence 5'-TGATCA-3' and regulates expression of target genes (By similarity). Selectively suppresses CCN1 transcription and hence blocks the downstream cell proliferation signals produced by CCN1 and inhibits CCN1-induced anchorage-independent growth and invasion in several cancer types, such as breast cancer, malignant glioma and metastatic melanoma. Possibly acts by interfering with AP-1 binding to CCN1 promoter.
