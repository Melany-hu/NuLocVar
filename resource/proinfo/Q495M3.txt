UniprotID	Q495M3
Accession	Q495M3;Q495M4;Q495M6;Q6ZWK5;Q7Z6B5
EntryName	S36A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proton-coupled amino acid transporter 2 (Proton/amino acid transporter 2) (Solute carrier family 36 member 2) (Transmembrane domain rich protein 1) (Tramdorin-1)
GeneName	SLC36A2 PAT2 TRAMD1
Length	483
Function	Electrogenic proton/amino acid symporter with a high selectivity for the small side chains amino acids glycine, alanine and proline, where both L- and D-enantiomers are transported. Extension of the backbone length, as in beta-alanine and 4-aminobutanoate or methylation of the amino group, as in sarcosine and N,N-dimethylglycine, are also tolerated but decrease transport efficiency. A free carboxyl group is preferred.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Recycling endosome membrane
