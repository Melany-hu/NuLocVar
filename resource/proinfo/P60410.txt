UniprotID	P60410
Accession	P60410;A0JNW4
EntryName	KR108_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 10-8 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 10.8) (Keratin-associated protein 10.8) (Keratin-associated protein 18-8) (Keratin-associated protein 18.8)
GeneName	KRTAP10-8 KAP10.8 KAP18-8 KRTAP10.8 KRTAP18-8 KRTAP18.8
Length	259
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
