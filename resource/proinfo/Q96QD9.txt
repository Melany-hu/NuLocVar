EntryName	UIF_HUMAN
ProteinName	UAP56-interacting factor (Forty-two-three domain-containing protein 1) (Protein 40-2-3)
GeneName	FYTTD1 UIF
Length	318
Function	Required for mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Acts as an adapter that uses the DDX39B/UAP56-NFX1 pathway to ensure efficient mRNA export and delivering to the nuclear pore. Associates with spliced and unspliced mRNAs simultaneously with ALYREF/THOC4.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleoplasm; Nucleus speckle
