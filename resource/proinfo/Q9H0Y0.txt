UniprotID	Q9H0Y0
Accession	Q9H0Y0;B2RE09;Q6PIX1;Q9H842
EntryName	ATG10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-like-conjugating enzyme ATG10 (EC 2.3.2.-) (Autophagy-related protein 10) (APG10-like)
GeneName	ATG10 APG10L PP12616
Length	220
Function	E2-like enzyme involved in autophagy. Acts as an E2-like enzyme that catalyzes the conjugation of ATG12 to ATG5. ATG12 conjugation to ATG5 is required for autophagy. Likely serves as an ATG5-recognition molecule. Not involved in ATG12 conjugation to ATG3 (By similarity). Plays a role in adenovirus-mediated cell lysis.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
