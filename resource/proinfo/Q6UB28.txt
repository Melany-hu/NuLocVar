UniprotID	Q6UB28
Accession	Q6UB28;Q1WNX3
EntryName	MAP12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methionine aminopeptidase 1D, mitochondrial (MAP 1D) (MetAP 1D) (EC 3.4.11.18) (Methionyl aminopeptidase type 1D, mitochondrial) (Peptidase M 1D)
GeneName	METAP1D MAP1D
Length	335
Function	Removes the N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins. The N-terminal methionine is often cleaved when the second residue in the primary sequence is small and uncharged (Met-Ala-, Cys, Gly, Pro, Ser, Thr, or Val). Requires deformylation of the N(alpha)-formylated initiator methionine before it can be hydrolyzed (By similarity). May play a role in colon tumorigenesis.
