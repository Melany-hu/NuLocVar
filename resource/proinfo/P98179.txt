UniprotID	P98179
Accession	P98179
EntryName	RBM3_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA-binding protein 3 (RNA-binding motif protein 3) (RNPL)
GeneName	RBM3 RNPL
Length	157
Function	Cold-inducible mRNA binding protein that enhances global protein synthesis at both physiological and mild hypothermic temperatures. Reduces the relative abundance of microRNAs, when overexpressed. Enhances phosphorylation of translation initiation factors and active polysome formation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cell projection; Dendrite
