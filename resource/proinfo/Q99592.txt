UniprotID	Q99592
Accession	Q99592;A8K5U3;Q13397;Q5VU40;Q8N463;Q9UD99
EntryName	ZBT18_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 18 (58 kDa repressor protein) (Transcriptional repressor RP58) (Translin-associated zinc finger protein 1) (TAZ-1) (Zinc finger protein 238) (Zinc finger protein C2H2-171)
GeneName	ZBTB18 RP58 TAZ1 ZNF238
Length	522
Function	Transcriptional repressor that plays a role in various developmental processes such as myogenesis and brain development. Plays a key role in myogenesis by directly repressing the expression of ID2 and ID3, 2 inhibitors of skeletal myogenesis. Also involved in controlling cell division of progenitor cells and regulating the survival of postmitotic cortical neurons. Specifically binds the consensus DNA sequence 5'-ACATCTG-3' which contains the E box core, and acts by recruiting chromatin remodeling multiprotein complexes. May also play a role in the organization of chromosomes in the nucleus.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
