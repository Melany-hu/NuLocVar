EntryName	TRIB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tribbles homolog 1 (TRB-1) (G-protein-coupled receptor-induced gene 2 protein) (GIG-2) (SKIP1)
GeneName	TRIB1 C8FW GIG2 TRB1
Length	372
Function	Adapter protein involved in protein degradation by interacting with COP1 ubiquitin ligase (PubMed:27041596). The COP1-binding motif is masked by autoinhibitory interactions with the protein kinase domain (PubMed:26455797). Serves to alter COP1 substrate specificity by directing the activity of COP1 toward CEBPA (PubMed:27041596). Binds selectively the recognition sequence of CEBPA (PubMed:26455797). Regulates myeloid cell differentiation by altering the expression of CEBPA in a COP1-dependent manner (By similarity). Controls macrophage, eosinophil and neutrophil differentiation via the COP1-binding domain (By similarity). Interacts with MAPK kinases and regulates activation of MAP kinases, but has no kinase activity (PubMed:15299019, PubMed:26455797).
