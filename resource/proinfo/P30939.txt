EntryName	5HT1F_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1F (5-HT-1F) (5-HT1F) (Serotonin receptor 1F)
GeneName	HTR1F HTR1EL
Length	366
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (PubMed:21422162, PubMed:34239069, PubMed:8380639, PubMed:8384716). Also functions as a receptor for various alkaloids and psychoactive substances (PubMed:21422162, PubMed:8380639, PubMed:8384716). Receptor for lasmiditan, a drug for the treatment of acute migraine (PubMed:34239069). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase (PubMed:34239069). HTR1F is coupled to G(i)/G(o) G alpha proteins and mediates inhibitory neurotransmission by inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity (PubMed:34239069, PubMed:35610220).
