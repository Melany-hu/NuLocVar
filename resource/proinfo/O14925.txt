UniprotID	O14925
Accession	O14925;Q53FF8;Q5T1E6;Q6P5S5
EntryName	TIM23_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim23
GeneName	TIMM23 TIM23
Length	209
Function	Essential component of the TIM23 complex, a complex that mediates the translocation of transit peptide-containing proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane (PubMed:10339406). Has a role in the activation of stress-induced mitophagy by protecting PINK1 from OMA1-mediated degradation and facilitating its accumulation at the outer mitochondrial membrane in response to depolarization (PubMed:37160114).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
