UniprotID	P14678
Accession	P14678;Q15490;Q6IB35;Q9UIS5
EntryName	RSMB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated proteins B and B' (snRNP-B) (Sm protein B/B') (Sm-B/B') (SmB/B')
GeneName	SNRPB COD SNRPB1
Length	240
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing as a core component of the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:18984161, PubMed:19325628, PubMed:25555158, PubMed:26912367, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:28781166, PubMed:32494006). Component of both the pre-catalytic spliceosome B complex and activated spliceosome C complexes (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:28781166). As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (PubMed:15146077). As part of the U7 snRNP it is involved in histone pre-mRNA 3'-end processing (PubMed:12975319).
