EntryName	TBC20_HUMAN
ProteinName	TBC1 domain family member 20
GeneName	TBC1D20 C20orf140
Length	403
Function	GTPase-activating protein (GAP) specific for Rab1 and Rab2 small GTPase families for which it can accelerate the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate by more than five orders of magnitude (PubMed:23236136). Also shows GAP activity for RAB18 GTPase (PubMed:26063829). Promotes RAB18 dissociation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane into the cytosol, probably through stimulating RAB18 GTP-hydrolysis (PubMed:26063829). Involved in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum structure (PubMed:24891604).
