UniprotID	Q96IY4
Accession	Q96IY4;A8K464;Q15114;Q5T9K1;Q5T9K2;Q9P2Y6
EntryName	CBPB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carboxypeptidase B2 (EC 3.4.17.20) (Carboxypeptidase U) (CPU) (Plasma carboxypeptidase B) (pCPB) (Thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor) (TAFI)
GeneName	CPB2
Length	423
Function	Cleaves C-terminal arginine or lysine residues from biologically active peptides such as kinins or anaphylatoxins in the circulation thereby regulating their activities. Down-regulates fibrinolysis by removing C-terminal lysine residues from fibrin that has already been partially degraded by plasmin.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
