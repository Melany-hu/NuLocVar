EntryName	SPTC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine palmitoyltransferase 1 (EC 2.3.1.50) (Long chain base biosynthesis protein 1) (LCB 1) (Serine-palmitoyl-CoA transferase 1) (SPT 1) (SPT1)
GeneName	SPTLC1 LCB1
Length	473
Function	Component of the serine palmitoyltransferase multisubunit enzyme (SPT) that catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid biosynthesis by condensing L-serine and activated acyl-CoA (most commonly palmitoyl-CoA) to form long-chain bases. The SPT complex is also composed of SPTLC2 or SPTLC3 and SPTSSA or SPTSSB. Within this complex, the heterodimer with SPTLC2 or SPTLC3 forms the catalytic core (PubMed:19416851, PubMed:33558762, PubMed:36170811). The composition of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex determines the substrate preference (PubMed:19416851, PubMed:33558762). The SPTLC1-SPTLC2-SPTSSA complex shows a strong preference for C16-CoA substrate, while the SPTLC1-SPTLC3-SPTSSA isozyme uses both C14-CoA and C16-CoA as substrates, with a slight preference for C14-CoA (PubMed:19416851, PubMed:19648650). The SPTLC1-SPTLC2-SPTSSB complex shows a strong preference for C18-CoA substrate, while the SPTLC1-SPTLC3-SPTSSB isozyme displays an ability to use a broader range of acyl-CoAs, without apparent preference (PubMed:19416851, PubMed:19648650, PubMed:33558761, PubMed:33558762). Required for adipocyte cell viability and metabolic homeostasis (By similarity).
