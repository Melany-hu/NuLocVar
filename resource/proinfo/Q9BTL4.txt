UniprotID	Q9BTL4
Accession	Q9BTL4;Q03827;Q2TAZ2
EntryName	IER2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Immediate early response gene 2 protein (Protein ETR101)
GeneName	IER2 ETR101 PIP92
Length	223
Function	DNA-binding protein that seems to act as a transcription factor (PubMed:19584537). Involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation, acts upon JNK-signaling pathway activation and plays a role in neurite outgrowth in hippocampal cells (By similarity). May mediate with FIBP FGF-signaling in the establishment of laterality in the embryo (By similarity). Promotes cell motility, seems to stimulate tumor metastasis (PubMed:22120713).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus
