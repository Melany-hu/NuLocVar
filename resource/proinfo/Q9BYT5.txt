UniprotID	Q9BYT5
Accession	Q9BYT5;A8MTN3;A8MXM4
EntryName	KRA22_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 2-2 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 2.2) (Keratin-associated protein 2.2)
GeneName	KRTAP2-2 KAP2.2 KRTAP2.2
Length	123
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins (By similarity).
