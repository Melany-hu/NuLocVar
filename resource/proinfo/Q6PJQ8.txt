UniprotID	Q6PJQ8
Accession	Q6PJQ8
EntryName	Q6PJQ8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Outer dense fiber protein 2 (Cenexin) (Outer dense fiber of sperm tails protein 2)
GeneName	ODF2
Length	174
Function	Seems to be a major component of sperm tail outer dense fibers (ODF). ODFs are filamentous structures located on the outside of the axoneme in the midpiece and principal piece of the mammalian sperm tail and may help to maintain the passive elastic structures and elastic recoil of the sperm tail. May have a modulating influence on sperm motility. Functions as a general scaffold protein that is specifically localized at the distal/subdistal appendages of mother centrioles. Component of the centrosome matrix required for the localization of PLK1 and NIN to the centrosomes. Required for the formation and/or maintenance of normal CETN1 assembly.
