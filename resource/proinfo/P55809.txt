EntryName	SCOT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase 1, mitochondrial (SCOT) (EC 2.8.3.5) (3-oxoacid CoA-transferase 1) (Somatic-type succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase) (SCOT-s) (Succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase)
GeneName	OXCT1 OXCT SCOT
Length	520
Function	Key enzyme for ketone body catabolism. Catalyzes the first, rate-limiting step of ketone body utilization in extrahepatic tissues, by transferring coenzyme A (CoA) from a donor thiolester species (succinyl-CoA) to an acceptor carboxylate (acetoacetate), and produces acetoacetyl-CoA. Acetoacetyl-CoA is further metabolized by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase into two acetyl-CoA molecules which enter the citric acid cycle for energy production (PubMed:10964512). Forms a dimeric enzyme where both of the subunits are able to form enzyme-CoA thiolester intermediates, but only one subunit is competent to transfer the CoA moiety to the acceptor carboxylate (3-oxo acid) and produce a new acyl-CoA. Formation of the enzyme-CoA intermediate proceeds via an unstable anhydride species formed between the carboxylate groups of the enzyme and substrate (By similarity).
