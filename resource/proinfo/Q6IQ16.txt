UniprotID	Q6IQ16
Accession	Q6IQ16
EntryName	SPOPL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Speckle-type POZ protein-like (HIB homolog 2) (Roadkill homolog 2)
GeneName	SPOPL
Length	392
Function	Component of a cullin-RING-based BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex that mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, but with relatively low efficiency. Cullin-RING-based BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes containing homodimeric SPOPL or the heterodimer formed by SPOP and SPOPL are less efficient than ubiquitin ligase complexes containing only SPOP. May function to down-regulate the activity of cullin-RING-based BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes that contain SPOP.
