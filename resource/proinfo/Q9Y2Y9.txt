UniprotID	Q9Y2Y9
Accession	Q9Y2Y9;Q9Y356
EntryName	KLF13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Krueppel-like factor 13 (Basic transcription element-binding protein 3) (BTE-binding protein 3) (Novel Sp1-like zinc finger transcription factor 1) (RANTES factor of late activated T-lymphocytes 1) (RFLAT-1) (Transcription factor BTEB3) (Transcription factor NSLP1)
GeneName	KLF13 BTEB3 NSLP1
Length	288
Function	Transcription factor that activates expression from GC-rich minimal promoter regions, including genes in the cells of the erythroid lineage (By similarity). Represses transcription by binding to the BTE site, a GC-rich DNA element, in competition with the activator SP1. It also represses transcription by interacting with the corepressor Sin3A and HDAC1 (PubMed:11477107). Activates RANTES and CCL5 expression in T-cells (PubMed:17513757).
