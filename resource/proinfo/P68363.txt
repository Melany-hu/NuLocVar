ProteinName	Tubulin alpha-1B chain (EC 3.6.5.-) (Alpha-tubulin ubiquitous) (Tubulin K-alpha-1) (Tubulin alpha-ubiquitous chain) [Cleaved into: Detyrosinated tubulin alpha-1B chain]
GeneName	TUBA1B
Length	451
Function	Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules, a cylinder consisting of laterally associated linear protofilaments composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers (PubMed:34996871). Microtubules grow by the addition of GTP-tubulin dimers to the microtubule end, where a stabilizing cap forms (PubMed:34996871). Below the cap, tubulin dimers are in GDP-bound state, owing to GTPase activity of alpha-tubulin (PubMed:34996871).
