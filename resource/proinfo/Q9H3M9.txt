UniprotID	Q9H3M9
Accession	Q9H3M9;B2RNY8
EntryName	ATX3L_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ataxin-3-like protein (EC 3.4.19.12) (Machado-Joseph disease protein 1-like)
GeneName	ATXN3L ATX3L MJDL
Length	355
Function	Deubiquitinating enzyme that cleaves both 'Lys-48'-linked and 'Lys-63'-linked poly-ubiquitin chains (in vitro) (PubMed:21118805). Acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme for the transcription factor KLF5, playing a role in the regulation of KLF5 stability (PubMed:26079537).
