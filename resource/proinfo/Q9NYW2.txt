UniprotID	Q9NYW2
Accession	Q9NYW2;Q4KN29;Q645Y2
EntryName	TA2R8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 8 (T2R8) (Taste receptor family B member 5) (TRB5)
GeneName	TAS2R8
Length	309
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
