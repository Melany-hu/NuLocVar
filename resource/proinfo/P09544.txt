UniprotID	P09544
Accession	P09544;A4D0V1;Q75N05;Q9UDP9
EntryName	WNT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Wnt-2 (Int-1-like protein 1) (Int-1-related protein) (IRP)
GeneName	WNT2 INT1L1 IRP
Length	360
Function	Ligand for members of the frizzled family of seven transmembrane receptors. Functions in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway that results in activation of transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family (PubMed:20018874). Functions as a upstream regulator of FGF10 expression. Plays an important role in embryonic lung development. May contribute to embryonic brain development by regulating the proliferation of dopaminergic precursors and neurons (By similarity).
