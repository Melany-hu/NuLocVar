Function	Belongs to the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to post-mitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity). Muscle-specific component of the BAF complex, a multiprotein complex involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology). Specifically binds acetylated lysines on histone 3 and 4 (H3K14ac, H3K9ac, H4K5ac, H4K8ac, H4K12ac, H4K16ac). In the complex, it acts as a tissue-specific anchor between histone acetylations and methylations and chromatin remodeling. It thereby probably plays an essential role in heart and skeletal muscle development.
