UniprotID	Q96A26
Accession	Q96A26;Q9NRN6;Q9UJX8
EntryName	F162A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein FAM162A (E2-induced gene 5 protein) (Growth and transformation-dependent protein) (HGTD-P)
GeneName	FAM162A C3orf28 E2IG5 DC16 FWP001
Length	154
Function	Proposed to be involved in regulation of apoptosis; the exact mechanism may differ between cell types/tissues (PubMed:15082785). May be involved in hypoxia-induced cell death of transformed cells implicating cytochrome C release and caspase activation (such as CASP9) and inducing mitochondrial permeability transition (PubMed:15082785). May be involved in hypoxia-induced cell death of neuronal cells probably by promoting release of AIFM1 from mitochondria to cytoplasm and its translocation to the nucleus; however, the involvement of caspases has been reported conflictingly (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion membrane
