UniprotID	Q8N2W9
Accession	Q8N2W9;O75926;Q96G19;Q9UN16
EntryName	PIAS4_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 SUMO-protein ligase PIAS4 (EC 2.3.2.27) (PIASy) (Protein inhibitor of activated STAT protein 4) (Protein inhibitor of activated STAT protein gamma) (PIAS-gamma)
GeneName	PIAS4 PIASG
Length	510
Function	Functions as an E3-type small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) ligase, stabilizing the interaction between UBE2I and the substrate, and as a SUMO-tethering factor (PubMed:12511558, PubMed:12631292, PubMed:12727872, PubMed:15831457, PubMed:15976810, PubMed:22508508, PubMed:32832608). Mediates sumoylation of ALKBH5, AXIN1, CEBPA, KLF8, GATA2, PARK7, HERC2, MYB, TCF4 and RNF168 (PubMed:12223491, PubMed:12511558, PubMed:12631292, PubMed:12727872, PubMed:12750312, PubMed:15831457, PubMed:15976810, PubMed:16617055, PubMed:22508508, PubMed:34048572). Plays a crucial role as a transcriptional coregulation in various cellular pathways, including the STAT pathway, the p53/TP53 pathway, the Wnt pathway and the steroid hormone signaling pathway (PubMed:11388671). Involved in gene silencing (PubMed:11248056). In Wnt signaling, represses LEF1 and enhances TCF4 transcriptional activities through promoting their sumoylations (PubMed:12727872, PubMed:15831457). Enhances the sumoylation of MTA1 and may participate in its paralog-selective sumoylation (PubMed:21965678). Binds to AT-rich DNA sequences, known as matrix or scaffold attachment regions (MARs/SARs) (By similarity). Catalyzes conjugation of SUMO2 to KAT5 in response to DNA damage, facilitating repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via homologous recombination (HR) (PubMed:32832608). Mediates sumoylation of PARP1 in response to PARP1 trapping to chromatin (PubMed:35013556). Mediates sumoylation of KLF8, repressiing KLF8 transcriptional activity and cell cycle progression into G(1) phase (PubMed:16617055). Sumoylates ALKBH5 downstream of MAPK8/JNK1 and MAPK9/JNK2 in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibiting ALKBH5 RNA demethylase activity (PubMed:34048572).
