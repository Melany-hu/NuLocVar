UniprotID	P51857
Accession	P51857;A1L4P6;A8K060;B4DPN3;B4DPN8
EntryName	AK1D1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member D1 (EC 1.3.1.3) (3-oxo-5-beta-steroid 4-dehydrogenase) (Delta(4)-3-ketosteroid 5-beta-reductase) (Delta(4)-3-oxosteroid 5-beta-reductase)
GeneName	AKR1D1 SRD5B1
Length	326
Function	Catalyzes the stereospecific NADPH-dependent reduction of the C4-C5 double bond of bile acid intermediates and steroid hormones carrying a delta(4)-3-one structure to yield an A/B cis-ring junction. This cis-configuration is crucial for bile acid biosynthesis and plays important roles in steroid metabolism. Capable of reducing a broad range of delta-(4)-3-ketosteroids from C18 (such as, 17beta-hydroxyestr-4-en-3-one) to C27 (such as, 7alpha-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
