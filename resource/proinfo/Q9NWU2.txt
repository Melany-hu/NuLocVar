UniprotID	Q9NWU2
Accession	Q9NWU2;E1P5I3;Q8N5M5
EntryName	GID8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucose-induced degradation protein 8 homolog (Two hybrid-associated protein 1 with RanBPM) (Twa1)
GeneName	GID8 C20orf11 TWA1
Length	228
Function	Core component of the CTLH E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex that selectively accepts ubiquitin from UBE2H and mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the transcription factor HBP1 (PubMed:29911972). Acts as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling pathway by promoting beta-catenin (CTNNB1) nuclear accumulation (PubMed:28829046).
