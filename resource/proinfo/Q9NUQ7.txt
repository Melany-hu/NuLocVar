EntryName	UFSP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ufm1-specific protease 2 (UfSP2) (EC 3.4.22.-)
GeneName	UFSP2 C4orf20
Length	469
Function	Thiol-dependent isopeptidase that specifically cleaves UFM1, a ubiquitin-like modifier protein, from conjugated proteins, such as CD274/PD-L1, CYB5R3, DDRGK1, MRE11, RPL26/uL24, TRIP4 and RPL26/uL24 (PubMed:25219498, PubMed:27351204, PubMed:27926783, PubMed:30783677, PubMed:31595041, PubMed:32160526, PubMed:33473208, PubMed:35394863, PubMed:35926457, PubMed:36543799, PubMed:36893266, PubMed:37795761, PubMed:38383785). While it is also able to mediate the processing of UFM1 precursors, a prerequisite for conjugation reactions, UFSP2 mainly acts as a protein deUFMylase that mediates deconjugation of UFM1 from target proteins (PubMed:27926783). Mediates deUFMylation of RPL26/uL24, a critical step to release the UFM1 ribosome E3 ligase (UREL) complex during the recycling of 60S ribosome subunits from the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:38383785). Catalyzes deUFMylation of TRIP4, regulating intracellular nuclear receptors transactivation and thereby regulate cell proliferation and differentiation (PubMed:25219498).
