EntryName	TYDP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (Tyr-DNA phosphodiesterase 2) (hTDP2) (EC 3.1.4.-) (5'-tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase) (5'-Tyr-DNA phosphodiesterase) (ETS1-associated protein 2) (ETS1-associated protein II) (EAPII) (TRAF and TNF receptor-associated protein) (Tyrosyl-RNA phosphodiesterase) (VPg unlinkase)
GeneName	TDP2 EAP2 TTRAP AD-022
Length	362
Function	DNA repair enzyme that can remove a variety of covalent adducts from DNA through hydrolysis of a 5'-phosphodiester bond, giving rise to DNA with a free 5' phosphate. Catalyzes the hydrolysis of dead-end complexes between DNA and the topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) active site tyrosine residue. The 5'-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase activity can enable the repair of TOP2-induced DNA double-strand breaks/DSBs without the need for nuclease activity, creating a 'clean' DSB with 5'-phosphate termini that are ready for ligation (PubMed:27060144, PubMed:27099339). Thereby, protects the transcription of many genes involved in neurological development and maintenance from the abortive activity of TOP2. Hydrolyzes 5'-phosphoglycolates on protruding 5' ends on DSBs due to DNA damage by radiation and free radicals. Has preference for single-stranded DNA or duplex DNA with a 4 base pair overhang as substrate. Acts as a regulator of ribosome biogenesis following stress. Also has 3'-tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase activity, but less efficiently and much slower than TDP1. Constitutes the major if not only 5'-tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase in cells. Also acts as an adapter by participating in the specific activation of MAP3K7/TAK1 in response to TGF-beta: associates with components of the TGF-beta receptor-TRAF6-TAK1 signaling module and promotes their ubiquitination dependent complex formation. Involved in non-canonical TGF-beta induced signaling routes. May also act as a negative regulator of ETS1 and may inhibit NF-kappa-B activation.
