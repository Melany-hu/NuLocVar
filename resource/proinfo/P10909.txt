ProteinName	Clusterin (Aging-associated gene 4 protein) (Apolipoprotein J) (Apo-J) (Complement cytolysis inhibitor) (CLI) (Complement-associated protein SP-40,40) (Ku70-binding protein 1) (NA1/NA2) (Sulfated glycoprotein 2) (SGP-2) (Testosterone-repressed prostate message 2) (TRPM-2) [Cleaved into: Clusterin beta chain (ApoJalpha) (Complement cytolysis inhibitor a chain) (SP-40,40 beta-chain); Clusterin alpha chain (ApoJbeta) (Complement cytolysis inhibitor b chain) (SP-40,40 alpha-chain)]
GeneName	CLU APOJ CLI KUB1 AAG4
Length	449
Function	Functions as extracellular chaperone that prevents aggregation of non native proteins (PubMed:11123922, PubMed:19535339). Prevents stress-induced aggregation of blood plasma proteins (PubMed:11123922, PubMed:12176985, PubMed:17260971, PubMed:19996109). Inhibits formation of amyloid fibrils by APP, APOC2, B2M, CALCA, CSN3, SNCA and aggregation-prone LYZ variants (in vitro) (PubMed:12047389, PubMed:17407782, PubMed:17412999). Does not require ATP (PubMed:11123922). Maintains partially unfolded proteins in a state appropriate for subsequent refolding by other chaperones, such as HSPA8/HSC70 (PubMed:11123922). Does not refold proteins by itself (PubMed:11123922). Binding to cell surface receptors triggers internalization of the chaperone-client complex and subsequent lysosomal or proteasomal degradation (PubMed:21505792). Protects cells against apoptosis and against cytolysis by complement (PubMed:2780565). Intracellular forms interact with ubiquitin and SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes and promote the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:20068069). Promotes proteasomal degradation of COMMD1 and IKBKB (PubMed:20068069). Modulates NF-kappa-B transcriptional activity (PubMed:12882985). A mitochondrial form suppresses BAX-dependent release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and inhibit apoptosis (PubMed:16113678, PubMed:17689225). Plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation (PubMed:19137541). An intracellular form suppresses stress-induced apoptosis by stabilizing mitochondrial membrane integrity through interaction with HSPA5 (PubMed:22689054). Secreted form does not affect caspase or BAX-mediated intrinsic apoptosis and TNF-induced NF-kappa-B-activity (PubMed:24073260). Secreted form act as an important modulator during neuronal differentiation through interaction with STMN3 (By similarity). Plays a role in the clearance of immune complexes that arise during cell injury (By similarity).
