UniprotID	P35080
Accession	P35080;B2R4C8;D3DNI4;Q4VBQ4;Q8WVF9;Q9HBK2
EntryName	PROF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Profilin-2 (Profilin II)
GeneName	PFN2
Length	140
Function	Binds to actin and affects the structure of the cytoskeleton. At high concentrations, profilin prevents the polymerization of actin, whereas it enhances it at low concentrations. By binding to PIP2, it inhibits the formation of IP3 and DG.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
