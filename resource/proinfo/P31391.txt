UniprotID	P31391
Accession	P31391;Q17RM1;Q17RM3;Q9UIY1
EntryName	SSR4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Somatostatin receptor type 4 (SS-4-R) (SS4-R) (SS4R) (SST4)
GeneName	SSTR4
Length	388
Function	Receptor for somatostatin-14. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which inhibits adenylyl cyclase. It is functionally coupled not only to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, but also to activation of both arachidonate release and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade. Mediates antiproliferative action of somatostatin in tumor cells.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
