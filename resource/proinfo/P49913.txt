UniprotID	P49913
Accession	P49913;Q71SN9
EntryName	CAMP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (18 kDa cationic antimicrobial protein) (CAP-18) (hCAP-18) [Cleaved into: Antibacterial peptide FALL-39 (FALL-39 peptide antibiotic); Antibacterial peptide LL-37; Antibacterial peptide KR-20; Antibacterial peptide LL-23; Antibacterial peptide LL-29; Antibacterial peptide KS-30; Antibacterial peptide RK-31; Antibacterial peptide FF-33]
GeneName	CAMP CAP18 FALL39 HSD26
Length	170
Function	Antimicrobial protein that is an integral component of the innate immune system (PubMed:14978112, PubMed:16637646, PubMed:18818205, PubMed:22879591, PubMed:9736536). Binds to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (PubMed:16637646, PubMed:18818205). Acts via neutrophil N-formyl peptide receptors to enhance the release of CXCL2 (PubMed:22879591). Postsecretory processing generates multiple cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides with various lengths which act as a topical antimicrobial defense in sweat on skin (PubMed:14978112). The unprocessed precursor form, cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, inhibits the growth of Gram-negative E.coli and E.aerogenes with efficiencies comparable to that of the mature peptide LL-37 (in vitro) (PubMed:9736536).
