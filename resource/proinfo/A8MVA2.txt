UniprotID	A8MVA2
Accession	A8MVA2
EntryName	KRA96_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 9-6 (Keratin-associated protein 9-like 2)
GeneName	KRTAP9-6 KAP9.6 KRTAP9.6 KRTAP9L2
Length	160
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins (By similarity).
