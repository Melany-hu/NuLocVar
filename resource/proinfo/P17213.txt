EntryName	BPI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI) (CAP 57)
GeneName	BPI
Length	487
Function	The cytotoxic action of BPI is limited to many species of Gram-negative bacteria; this specificity may be explained by a strong affinity of the very basic N-terminal half for the negatively charged lipopolysaccharides that are unique to the Gram-negative bacterial outer envelope. Has antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacterium P.aeruginosa, this activity is inhibited by LPS from P.aeruginosa.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Cytoplasmic granule membrane
