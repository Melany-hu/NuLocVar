UniprotID	G3V2P5
Accession	G3V2P5
EntryName	G3V2P5_HUMAN
ProteinName	mRNA decay activator protein ZFP36 (Zinc finger protein 36)
GeneName	ZFP36L1
Length	207
Function	Zinc-finger RNA-binding protein that destabilizes several cytoplasmic AU-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNA transcripts by promoting their poly(A) tail removal or deadenylation, and hence provide a mechanism for attenuating protein synthesis. Acts as a 3'-untranslated region (UTR) ARE mRNA-binding adapter protein to communicate signaling events to the mRNA decay machinery. Functions by recruiting the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and probably other components of the cytoplasmic RNA decay machinery to the bound ARE-containing mRNAs, and hence promotes ARE-mediated mRNA deadenylation and decay processes. Binds to 3'-UTR ARE of numerous mRNAs.
