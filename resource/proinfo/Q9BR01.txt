UniprotID	Q9BR01
Accession	Q9BR01;B2R7N3;O43728
EntryName	ST4A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sulfotransferase 4A1 (ST4A1) (EC 2.8.2.-) (Brain sulfotransferase-like protein) (hBR-STL) (hBR-STL-1) (Nervous system sulfotransferase) (NST)
GeneName	SULT4A1 SULTX3
Length	284
Function	Atypical sulfotransferase family member with very low affinity for 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) and very low catalytic activity towards L-triiodothyronine, thyroxine, estrone, p-nitrophenol, 2-naphthylamine, and 2-beta-naphthol. May have a role in the metabolism of drugs and neurotransmitters in the CNS.
