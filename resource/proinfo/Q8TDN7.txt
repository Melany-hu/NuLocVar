UniprotID	Q8TDN7
Accession	Q8TDN7
EntryName	ACER1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alkaline ceramidase 1 (AlkCDase 1) (Alkaline CDase 1) (EC 3.5.1.-) (EC 3.5.1.23) (Acylsphingosine deacylase 3) (N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 3)
GeneName	ACER1 ASAH3
Length	264
Function	Endoplasmic reticulum ceramidase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramides into sphingosine and free fatty acids at alkaline pH (PubMed:17713573, PubMed:20207939, PubMed:20628055). Ceramides, sphingosine, and its phosphorylated form sphingosine-1-phosphate are bioactive lipids that mediate cellular signaling pathways regulating several biological processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation (PubMed:12783875). Exhibits a strong substrate specificity towards the natural stereoisomer of ceramides with D-erythro-sphingosine as a backbone and has a higher activity towards very long-chain unsaturated fatty acids like the C24:1-ceramide (PubMed:17713573, PubMed:20207939). May also hydrolyze dihydroceramides to produce dihydrosphingosine (PubMed:20207939, PubMed:20628055). ACER1 is a skin-specific ceramidase that regulates the levels of ceramides, sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate in the epidermis, mediates the calcium-induced differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes and more generally plays an important role in skin homeostasis (PubMed:17713573).
