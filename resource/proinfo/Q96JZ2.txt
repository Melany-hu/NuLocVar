UniprotID	Q96JZ2
Accession	Q96JZ2;B5ME72;Q6ZNG7
EntryName	HSH2D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hematopoietic SH2 domain-containing protein (Hematopoietic SH2 protein) (Adaptor in lymphocytes of unknown function X)
GeneName	HSH2D ALX
Length	352
Function	May be a modulator of the apoptotic response through its ability to affect mitochondrial stability (By similarity). Adapter protein involved in tyrosine kinase and CD28 signaling. Seems to affect CD28-mediated activation of the RE/AP element of the interleukin-2 promoter.
