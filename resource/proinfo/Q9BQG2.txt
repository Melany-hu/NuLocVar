EntryName	NUD12_HUMAN
ProteinName	NAD-capped RNA hydrolase NUDT12 (DeNADding enzyme NUDT12) (EC 3.6.1.-) (NADH pyrophosphatase NUDT12) (EC 3.6.1.22) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 12) (Nudix motif 12)
GeneName	NUDT12
Length	462
Function	mRNA decapping enzyme that specifically removes the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) cap from a subset of mRNAs by hydrolyzing the diphosphate linkage to produce nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and 5' monophosphate mRNA (PubMed:31101919, PubMed:31875550). The NAD-cap is present at the 5'-end of some RNAs; in contrast to the canonical N7 methylguanosine (m7G) cap, the NAD cap promotes mRNA decay (PubMed:31101919). Preferentially acts on NAD-capped transcripts in response to nutrient stress (PubMed:31101919). Also acts on free nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide molecules: hydrolyzes NAD(H) into NMN(H) and AMP, and NADPH into NMNH and 2',5'-ADP (PubMed:12790796). May act to regulate the concentration of peroxisomal nicotinamide nucleotide cofactors required for oxidative metabolism in this organelle (PubMed:12790796). Regulates the levels of circadian clock components PER1, PER2, PER3 and CRY2 in the liver (By similarity).
