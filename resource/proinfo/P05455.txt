UniprotID	P05455
Accession	P05455;Q15367;Q53XJ4
EntryName	LA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lupus La protein (La autoantigen) (La ribonucleoprotein) (Sjoegren syndrome type B antigen) (SS-B)
GeneName	SSB
Length	408
Function	Binds to the 3' poly(U) terminus of nascent RNA polymerase III transcripts, protecting them from exonuclease digestion and facilitating their folding and maturation (PubMed:2470590, PubMed:3192525). In case of Coxsackievirus B3 infection, binds to the viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and stimulates the IRES-mediated translation (PubMed:12384597).
