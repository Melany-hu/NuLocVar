UniprotID	Q96FZ7
Accession	Q96FZ7;A8K7U0;Q53FU4;Q9HAE8
EntryName	CHMP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Charged multivesicular body protein 6 (Chromatin-modifying protein 6) (Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 20) (Vps20) (hVps20)
GeneName	CHMP6 VPS20
Length	201
Function	Probable core component of the endosomal sorting required for transport complex III (ESCRT-III) which is involved in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. In the ESCRT-III complex, it probably serves as an acceptor for the ESCRT-II complex on endosomal membranes.
