UniprotID	Q8WXB1
Accession	Q8WXB1;Q53RV0;Q8N1Z9;Q96GH6
EntryName	MT21A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein N-lysine methyltransferase METTL21A (EC 2.1.1.-) (HSPA lysine methyltransferase) (HSPA-KMT) (Hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 557b) (Methyltransferase-like protein 21A)
GeneName	METTL21A FAM119A HCA557B
Length	218
Function	Protein-lysine methyltransferase that selectively trimethylates residues in heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family members. Contributes to the in vivo trimethylation of Lys residues in HSPA1 and HSPA8. In vitro methylates 'Lys-561' in HSPA1, 'Lys-564' in HSPA2, 'Lys-585' in HSPA5, 'Lys-563' in HSPA6 and 'Lys-561' in HSPA8.
