Accession	P12081;B4DHQ1;B4DY73;D6REN6;J3KNE5
EntryName	HARS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histidine--tRNA ligase, cytoplasmic (EC 6.1.1.21) (Histidyl-tRNA synthetase) (HisRS)
GeneName	HARS1 HARS HRS
Length	509
Function	Catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of histidine to the 3'-end of its cognate tRNA, via the formation of an aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate (His-AMP) (PubMed:29235198). Plays a role in axon guidance (PubMed:26072516).
