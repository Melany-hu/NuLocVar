UniprotID	Q4V339
Accession	Q4V339
EntryName	ZNG1F_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc-regulated GTPase metalloprotein activator 1F (EC 3.6.5.-) (Cobalamin synthase W domain-containing protein 6) (COBW domain-containing protein 6)
GeneName	ZNG1F CBWD6 CBWD7
Length	395
Function	Zinc chaperone that directly transfers zinc cofactor to target metalloproteins, thereby activating them (By similarity). Catalyzes zinc insertion into the active site of methionine aminopeptidase METAP1, which function to cleave the initiator methionine from polypeptides during or after protein translation (PubMed:35584702). Mechanistically, the N-terminal psi-PxLVp motif binds to the C6H2-type zinc finger of inactive form of METAP1 (By similarity). After formation of the docked complex, zinc is transferred from the CXCC motif in the GTPase domain of ZNG1F to the zinc binding site in the peptidase domain of METAP1 in a process requiring GTP hydrolysis (By similarity). GTP/GDP exchange is required for release of active METAP1 (By similarity).
