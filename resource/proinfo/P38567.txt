UniprotID	P38567
Accession	P38567;Q8TC30
EntryName	HYALP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hyaluronidase PH-20 (Hyal-PH20) (EC 3.2.1.35) (Hyaluronoglucosaminidase PH-20) (Sperm adhesion molecule 1) (Sperm surface protein PH-20)
GeneName	SPAM1 HYAL3 PH20
Length	509
Function	Involved in sperm-egg adhesion. Upon fertilization sperm must first penetrate a layer of cumulus cells that surrounds the egg before reaching the zona pellucida. The cumulus cells are embedded in a matrix containing hyaluronic acid which is formed prior to ovulation. This protein aids in penetrating the layer of cumulus cells by digesting hyaluronic acid.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
