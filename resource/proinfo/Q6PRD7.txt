UniprotID	Q6PRD7
Accession	Q6PRD7;B2RUY1
EntryName	CEMP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cementoblastoma-derived protein 1 (Cementum protein 1) (Cementum protein 23) (CP-23)
GeneName	CEMP1
Length	247
Function	May play a role in development of the periodontium which surrounds and supports the teeth by promoting the differentiation of multi-potent cells from the periodontal ligament into cementoblasts to form the cementum (PubMed:17509525, PubMed:21465469, PubMed:21929512). Binds hydroxyapatite and may promote the biomineralization of the cementum (PubMed:19393626). Also promotes cell proliferation (PubMed:17509525, PubMed:21929512, PubMed:26011628).
