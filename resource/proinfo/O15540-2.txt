UniprotID	O15540-2
Accession	O15540;B2R4L1;O14951;Q6IAU7;Q9H047
EntryName	FABP7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fatty acid-binding protein, brain (Brain lipid-binding protein) (BLBP) (Brain-type fatty acid-binding protein) (B-FABP) (Fatty acid-binding protein 7) (Mammary-derived growth inhibitor related)
GeneName	FABP7 BLBP FABPB MRG
Length	166
Function	B-FABP could be involved in the transport of a so far unknown hydrophobic ligand with potential morphogenic activity during CNS development. It is required for the establishment of the radial glial fiber system in developing brain, a system that is necessary for the migration of immature neurons to establish cortical layers (By similarity).
