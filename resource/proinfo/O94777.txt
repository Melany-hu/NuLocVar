UniprotID	O94777
Accession	O94777;Q5XKK9;Q6FGH3
EntryName	DPM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dolichol phosphate-mannose biosynthesis regulatory protein (Dolichol-phosphate mannose synthase subunit 2) (DPM synthase subunit 2)
GeneName	DPM2 My026
Length	84
Function	Regulates the biosynthesis of dolichol phosphate-mannose (PubMed:10835346). Regulatory subunit of the dolichol-phosphate mannose (DPM) synthase complex; essential for the ER localization and stable expression of DPM1 (PubMed:10835346). Part of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex that catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol and participates in the first step of GPI biosynthesis (PubMed:16162815). May act by regulating the GPI-GNT complex (PubMed:10944123).
