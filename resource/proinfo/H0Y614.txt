UniprotID	H0Y614
Accession	H0Y614
EntryName	H0Y614_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-fold modifier 1
GeneName	UFM1
Length	81
Function	Ubiquitin-like modifier which can be covalently attached via an isopeptide bond to lysine residues of substrate proteins as a monomer or a lysine-linked polymer. The so-called ufmylation, requires the UFM1-activating E1 enzyme UBA5, the UFM1-conjugating E2 enzyme UFC1, and the UFM1-ligase E3 enzyme UFL1. Ufmylation is involved in various processes, such as ribosome recycling, response to DNA damage, transcription or reticulophagy (also called ER-phagy) induced in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress.
