UniprotID	O94992
Accession	O94992;B2R8Y5
EntryName	HEXI1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein HEXIM1 (Cardiac lineage protein 1) (Estrogen down-regulated gene 1 protein) (Hexamethylene bis-acetamide-inducible protein 1) (Menage a quatre protein 1)
GeneName	HEXIM1 CLP1 EDG1 HIS1 MAQ1
Length	359
Function	Transcriptional regulator which functions as a general RNA polymerase II transcription inhibitor (PubMed:14580347, PubMed:15201869, PubMed:15713661). Core component of the 7SK RNP complex: in cooperation with 7SK snRNA sequesters P-TEFb in a large inactive 7SK snRNP complex preventing RNA polymerase II phosphorylation and subsequent transcriptional elongation (PubMed:12832472, PubMed:14580347, PubMed:15201869, PubMed:15713661). May also regulate NF-kappa-B, ESR1, NR3C1 and CIITA-dependent transcriptional activity (PubMed:15940264, PubMed:15941832, PubMed:17088550). Plays a role in the regulation of DNA virus-mediated innate immune response by assembling into the HDP-RNP complex, a complex that serves as a platform for IRF3 phosphorylation and subsequent innate immune response activation through the cGAS-STING pathway (PubMed:28712728).
