ProteinName	Polyribonucleotide 5'-hydroxyl-kinase Clp1 (EC 2.7.1.78) (Polyadenylation factor Clp1) (Polynucleotide kinase Clp1) (Pre-mRNA cleavage complex II protein Clp1)
GeneName	CLP1 HEAB
Length	425
Function	Polynucleotide kinase that can phosphorylate the 5'-hydroxyl groups of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and double-stranded DNA:RNA hybrids. dsRNA is phosphorylated more efficiently than dsDNA, and the RNA component of a DNA:RNA hybrid is phosphorylated more efficiently than the DNA component. Plays a key role in both tRNA splicing and mRNA 3'-end formation. Component of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex: phosphorylates the 5'-terminus of the tRNA 3'-exon during tRNA splicing; this phosphorylation event is a prerequisite for the subsequent ligation of the two exon halves and the production of a mature tRNA (PubMed:24766809, PubMed:24766810). Its role in tRNA splicing and maturation is required for cerebellar development (PubMed:24766809, PubMed:24766810). Component of the pre-mRNA cleavage complex II (CF-II), which seems to be required for mRNA 3'-end formation. Also phosphorylates the 5'-terminus of exogenously introduced short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which is a necessary prerequisite for their incorporation into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). However, endogenous siRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) that are produced by the cleavage of dsRNA precursors by DICER1 already contain a 5'-phosphate group, so this protein may be dispensible for normal RNA-mediated gene silencing.
