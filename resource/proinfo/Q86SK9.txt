EntryName	SCD5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 5 (EC 1.14.19.1) (Acyl-CoA-desaturase 4) (HSCD5) (Stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase) (Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2)
GeneName	SCD5 ACOD4 SCD2 SCD4
Length	330
Function	Stearoyl-CoA desaturase that utilizes O(2) and electrons from reduced cytochrome b5 to introduce the first double bond into saturated fatty acyl-CoA substrates. Catalyzes the insertion of a cis double bond at the delta-9 position into fatty acyl-CoA substrates including palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA (PubMed:15610069, PubMed:15907797, PubMed:22745828). Gives rise to a mixture of 16:1 and 18:1 unsaturated fatty acids (PubMed:15610069, PubMed:15907797). Involved in neuronal cell proliferation and differentiation through down-regulation of EGFR/AKT/MAPK and Wnt signaling pathways (PubMed:22745828).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
