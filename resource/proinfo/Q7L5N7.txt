EntryName	PCAT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2 (LPC acyltransferase 2) (LPCAT-2) (LysoPC acyltransferase 2) (EC 2.3.1.23) (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 11) (1-AGP acyltransferase 11) (1-AGPAT 11) (EC 2.3.1.51) (1-acylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase) (1-alkenylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.25) (1-alkylglycerophosphocholine O-acetyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.67) (Acetyl-CoA:lyso-platelet-activating factor acetyltransferase) (Acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase) (Lyso-PAF acetyltransferase) (LysoPAFAT) (Acyltransferase-like 1) (Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase alpha) (LPAAT-alpha)
GeneName	LPCAT2 AGPAT11 AYTL1
Length	544
Function	Exhibits both acyltransferase and acetyltransferase activities (PubMed:17182612, PubMed:20363836, PubMed:21498505). Catalyzes the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or LPC) into phosphatidylcholine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or PC) (PubMed:21498505). Catalyzes the conversion 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid or LPA) into 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (phosphatidic acid or PA) by incorporating an acyl moiety at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone (PubMed:20363836). Involved in platelet-activating factor (PAF) biosynthesis by catalyzing the conversion of the PAF precursor, 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PAF) into 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAF) (PubMed:17182612). Also converts lyso-PAF to 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC), a major component of cell membranes and a PAF precursor (By similarity). Under resting conditions, acyltransferase activity is preferred (By similarity). Upon acute inflammatory stimulus, acetyltransferase activity is enhanced and PAF synthesis increases (By similarity). Involved in the regulation of lipid droplet number and size (PubMed:25491198).
