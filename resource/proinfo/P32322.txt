UniprotID	P32322
Accession	P32322;A6NFM2;B4DMU0;Q6FHI4;Q96DI6;Q9HBQ4
EntryName	P5CR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1, mitochondrial (P5C reductase 1) (P5CR 1) (EC 1.5.1.2)
GeneName	PYCR1
Length	319
Function	Oxidoreductase that catalyzes the last step in proline biosynthesis, which corresponds to the reduction of pyrroline-5-carboxylate to L-proline using NAD(P)H (PubMed:16730026, PubMed:19648921, PubMed:23024808, PubMed:28258219). At physiologic concentrations, has higher specific activity in the presence of NADH (PubMed:16730026, PubMed:23024808). Involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress (PubMed:16730026, PubMed:19648921).
