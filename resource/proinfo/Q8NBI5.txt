UniprotID	Q8NBI5
Accession	Q8NBI5;B4DNR8;E7EQD2;Q9NSS4
EntryName	S43A3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Equilibrative nucleobase transporter 1 (Protein FOAP-13) (Solute carrier family 43 member 3)
GeneName	SLC43A3 ENBT1 PSEC0252
Length	491
Function	Sodium-independent purine-selective nucleobase transporter which mediates the equilibrative transport of extracellular purine nucleobases such as adenine, guanine and hypoxanthine (PubMed:26455426, PubMed:32339528). May regulate fatty acid (FA) transport in adipocytes, acting as a positive regulator of FA efflux and as a negative regulator of FA uptake (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Basolateral cell membrane
