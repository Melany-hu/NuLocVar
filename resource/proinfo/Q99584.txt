UniprotID	Q99584
Accession	Q99584;Q52PI9;Q6FGF8
EntryName	S10AD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein S100-A13 (S100 calcium-binding protein A13)
GeneName	S100A13
Length	98
Function	Plays a role in the export of proteins that lack a signal peptide and are secreted by an alternative pathway. Binds two calcium ions per subunit. Binds one copper ion. Binding of one copper ion does not interfere with calcium binding. Required for the copper-dependent stress-induced export of IL1A and FGF1. The calcium-free protein binds to lipid vesicles containing phosphatidylserine, but not to vesicles containing phosphatidylcholine (By similarity).
