UniprotID	Q96HR3
Accession	Q96HR3;C6GKU9
EntryName	MED30_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 30 (Mediator complex subunit 30) (TRAP/Mediator complex component TRAP25) (Thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 6) (Thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein complex 25 kDa component) (Trap25)
GeneName	MED30 THRAP6 TRAP25
Length	178
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
