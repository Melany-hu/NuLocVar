EntryName	VDAC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Non-selective voltage-gated ion channel VDAC2 (VDAC-2) (hVDAC2) (Outer mitochondrial membrane protein porin 2)
GeneName	VDAC2
Length	294
Function	Non-selective voltage-gated ion channel that mediates the transport of anions and cations through the mitochondrion outer membrane and plasma membrane (PubMed:8420959). The channel adopts an open conformation at zero mV and a closed conformation at both positive and negative potentials (PubMed:8420959). There are two populations of channels; the main that functions in a lower open-state conductance with lower ion selectivity, that switch, in a voltage-dependent manner, from the open to a low-conducting 'closed' state and the other that has a normal ion selectivity in the typical high conductance, 'open' state (PubMed:8420959). Binds various lipids, including the sphingolipid ceramide, the phospholipid phosphatidylcholine, and the sterols cholesterol and oxysterol (PubMed:31015432). Binding of ceramide promotes the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) apoptotic pathway (PubMed:31015432).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane; Membrane
