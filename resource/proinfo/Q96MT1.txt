UniprotID	Q96MT1
Accession	Q96MT1;B7Z903;B7Z949;E7EVI7;Q8IVP7
EntryName	RN145_HUMAN
ProteinName	RING finger protein 145 (EC 2.3.2.27)
GeneName	RNF145
Length	663
Function	E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes the direct transfer of ubiquitin from E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to a specific substrate. In response to bacterial infection, negatively regulates the phagocyte oxidative burst by controlling the turnover of the NADPH oxidase complex subunits. Promotes monoubiquitination of CYBA and 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of CYBB NADPH oxidase catalytic subunits, both essential for the generation of antimicrobial reactive oxygen species. Involved in the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis. In response to high sterol concentrations ubiquitinates HMGCR, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, and targets it for degradation. The interaction with INSIG1 is required for this function. In addition, triggers ubiquitination of SCAP, likely inhibiting its transport to the Golgi apparatus and the subsequent processing/maturation of SREBPF2, ultimately down-regulating cholesterol biosynthesis.
