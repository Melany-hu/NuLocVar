EntryName	KDM1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (EC 1.14.99.66) (BRAF35-HDAC complex protein BHC110) (Flavin-containing amine oxidase domain-containing protein 2) ([histone H3]-dimethyl-L-lysine(4) FAD-dependent demethylase 1A)
GeneName	KDM1A AOF2 KDM1 KIAA0601 LSD1
Length	852
Function	Histone demethylase that can demethylate both 'Lys-4' (H3K4me) and 'Lys-9' (H3K9me) of histone H3, thereby acting as a coactivator or a corepressor, depending on the context (PubMed:15620353, PubMed:15811342, PubMed:16079794, PubMed:16079795, PubMed:16140033, PubMed:16223729, PubMed:27292636). Acts by oxidizing the substrate by FAD to generate the corresponding imine that is subsequently hydrolyzed (PubMed:15620353, PubMed:15811342, PubMed:16079794, PubMed:21300290). Acts as a corepressor by mediating demethylation of H3K4me, a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation. Demethylates both mono- (H3K4me1) and di-methylated (H3K4me2) H3K4me (PubMed:15620353, PubMed:20389281, PubMed:21300290, PubMed:23721412). May play a role in the repression of neuronal genes. Alone, it is unable to demethylate H3K4me on nucleosomes and requires the presence of RCOR1/CoREST to achieve such activity (PubMed:16079794, PubMed:16140033, PubMed:16885027, PubMed:21300290, PubMed:23721412). Also acts as a coactivator of androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcription, by being recruited to AR target genes and mediating demethylation of H3K9me, a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression. The presence of PRKCB in AR-containing complexes, which mediates phosphorylation of 'Thr-6' of histone H3 (H3T6ph), a specific tag that prevents demethylation H3K4me, prevents H3K4me demethylase activity of KDM1A (PubMed:16079795). Demethylates di-methylated 'Lys-370' of p53/TP53 which prevents interaction of p53/TP53 with TP53BP1 and represses p53/TP53-mediated transcriptional activation. Demethylates and stabilizes the DNA methylase DNMT1 (PubMed:29691401). Demethylates methylated 'Lys-42' and methylated 'Lys-117' of SOX2 (PubMed:29358331). Required for gastrulation during embryogenesis. Component of a RCOR/GFI/KDM1A/HDAC complex that suppresses, via histone deacetylase (HDAC) recruitment, a number of genes implicated in multilineage blood cell development (PubMed:16079794, PubMed:16140033). Facilitates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by acting as an effector of SNAI1-mediated transcription repression of epithelial markers E-cadherin/CDH1, CDN7 and KRT8 (PubMed:20562920, PubMed:27292636). Required for the maintenance of the silenced state of the SNAI1 target genes E-cadherin/CDH1 and CDN7 (PubMed:20389281). Required for the repression of GIPR expression (PubMed:34655521, PubMed:34906447).
