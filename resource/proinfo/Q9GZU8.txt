UniprotID	Q9GZU8
Accession	Q9GZU8
EntryName	PIP30_HUMAN
ProteinName	PSME3-interacting protein (NEFA-interacting nuclear protein NIP30) (PA28G-interacting protein)
GeneName	PSME3IP1 C16orf94 FAM192A NIP30 PIP30 CDA018 CDA10
Length	254
Function	Promotes the association of the proteasome activator complex subunit PSME3 with the 20S proteasome and regulates its activity. Inhibits PSME3-mediated degradation of some proteasome substrates, probably by affecting their diffusion rate into the catalytic chamber of the proteasome. Also inhibits the interaction of PSME3 with COIL, inhibits accumulation of PSME3 in Cajal bodies and positively regulates the number of Cajal bodies in the nucleus.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
