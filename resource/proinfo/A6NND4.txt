UniprotID	A6NND4
Accession	A6NND4;B9EGZ8
EntryName	O2AT4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Olfactory receptor 2AT4 (Olfactory receptor OR11-265)
GeneName	OR2AT4
Length	320
Function	Olfactory receptor (PubMed:24999593, PubMed:30228264). Activated by the synthetic sandalwood odorant sandalore (PubMed:24999593, PubMed:30228264). Endogenous ligand is unknown (Probable). The activity of this receptor is probably mediated by G proteins which induce elevation of intracellular Ca(2+), a cAMP-dependent pathway and phosphorylation of MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and p38 MAPKs (PubMed:24999593, PubMed:30228264). Activation of OR2AT4 induces proliferation, migration, and re-epithelialization during wound-healing processes of keratinocytes (PubMed:24999593). Stimulation of OR2AT4 by sandalore promotes hair growth by decreasing apoptosis and increasing production of the anagen-prolonging growth factor IGF1 as well as other pathways involving various kinases (PubMed:30228264).
