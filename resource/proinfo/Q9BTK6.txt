EntryName	PAGR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	PAXIP1-associated glutamate-rich protein 1 (Glutamate-rich coactivator interacting with SRC1) (GAS) (PAXIP1-associated protein 1) (PTIP-associated protein 1)
GeneName	PAGR1 C16orf53 PA1
Length	254
Function	Its association with the histone methyltransferase MLL2/MLL3 complex is suggesting a role in epigenetic transcriptional activation. However, in association with PAXIP1/PTIP is proposed to function at least in part independently of the MLL2/MLL3 complex. Proposed to be recruited by PAXIP1 to sites of DNA damage where the PAGR1:PAXIP1 complex is required for cell survival in response to DNA damage independently of the MLL2/MLL3 complex (PubMed:19124460). However, its function in DNA damage has been questioned (By similarity). During immunoglobulin class switching in activated B-cells is involved in transcription regulation of downstream switch regions at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (Igh) locus independently of the MLL2/MLL3 complex (By similarity). Involved in both estrogen receptor-regulated gene transcription and estrogen-stimulated G1/S cell-cycle transition (PubMed:19039327). Acts as a transcriptional cofactor for nuclear hormone receptors. Inhibits the induction properties of several steroid receptors such as NR3C1, AR and PPARG; the mechanism of inhibition appears to be gene-dependent (PubMed:23161582).
