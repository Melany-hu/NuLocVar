UniprotID	Q92504
Accession	Q92504;B0UXF6;Q5STP8;Q9UIQ0
EntryName	S39A7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc transporter SLC39A7 (Histidine-rich membrane protein Ke4) (Really interesting new gene 5 protein) (Solute carrier family 39 member 7) (Zrt-, Irt-like protein 7) (ZIP7)
GeneName	SLC39A7 HKE4 RING5
Length	469
Function	Transports Zn(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi apparatus to the cytosol, playing an essential role in the regulation of cytosolic zinc levels (PubMed:14525538, PubMed:15705588, PubMed:28205653, PubMed:29980658). Acts as a gatekeeper of zinc release from intracellular stores, requiring post-translational activation by phosphorylation, resulting in activation of multiple downstream pathways leading to cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:22317921, PubMed:28205653, PubMed:29980658). Has an essential role in B cell development and is required for proper B cell receptor signaling (PubMed:30718914). Plays an important role in maintaining intestinal epithelial homeostasis and skin dermis development by regulating ER function (By similarity). Controls cell signaling pathways involved in glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle (By similarity). Has a protective role against ER stress in different biological contexts (PubMed:29980658, PubMed:30237509). Mediates Zn(2+)-induced ferroptosis (PubMed:33608508).
