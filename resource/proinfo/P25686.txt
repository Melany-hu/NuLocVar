EntryName	DNJB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 2 (Heat shock 40 kDa protein 3) (Heat shock protein J1) (HSJ-1)
GeneName	DNAJB2 HSJ1 HSPF3
Length	324
Function	Functions as a co-chaperone, regulating the substrate binding and activating the ATPase activity of chaperones of the HSP70/heat shock protein 70 family (PubMed:22219199, PubMed:7957263). In parallel, also contributes to the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of misfolded proteins (PubMed:15936278, PubMed:21625540). Thereby, may regulate the aggregation and promote the functional recovery of misfolded proteins like HTT, MC4R, PRKN, RHO and SOD1 and be crucial for many biological processes (PubMed:12754272, PubMed:20889486, PubMed:21719532, PubMed:22396390, PubMed:24023695). Isoform 1 which is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes may specifically function in ER-associated protein degradation of misfolded proteins (PubMed:15936278).
