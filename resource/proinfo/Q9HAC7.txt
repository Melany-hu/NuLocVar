ProteinName	Succinyl-CoA:glutarate CoA-transferase (EC 2.8.3.-) (Dermal papilla-derived protein 13) (Dicarboxyl-CoA:dicarboxylic acid coenzyme A transferase SUGCT) (Succinate--hydroxymethylglutarate CoA-transferase) (EC 2.8.3.13)
GeneName	SUGCT C7orf10 DERP13
Length	438
Function	Coenzyme A (CoA) transferase that reversibly catalyzes the transfer of a CoA moiety from a dicarboxyl-CoA to a dicarboxylate in a metabolite recycling process. Displays preference for succinyl-CoA and glutarate-CoA as dicarboxyl-CoA donors and glutarate, succinate, adipate/hexanedioate, itaconate and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate as dicarboxylate acceptors (PubMed:23893049, PubMed:34492704, PubMed:38915184). Acts on intermediates or end products of lysine and tryptophan degradation pathway, in particular catalyzes succinyl-CoA-dependent reesterification of free glutarate into glutaryl-CoA to prevent renal excretion of glutarate (PubMed:18926513, PubMed:23893049, PubMed:38915184). Upon inflammation, may convert macrophage-derived itaconate to itaconyl-CoA in erythroid precursors where it negatively regulates the TCA cycle and heme synthesis to limit erythroid differentiation in the context of stress erythropoiesis (PubMed:34492704).
