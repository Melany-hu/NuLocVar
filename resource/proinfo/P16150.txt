UniprotID	P16150
Accession	P16150;A8K9B1
EntryName	LEUK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leukosialin (GPL115) (Galactoglycoprotein) (GALGP) (Leukocyte sialoglycoprotein) (Sialophorin) (CD antigen CD43) [Cleaved into: CD43 cytoplasmic tail (CD43-ct) (CD43ct)]
GeneName	SPN CD43
Length	400
Function	Predominant cell surface sialoprotein of leukocytes which regulates multiple T-cell functions, including T-cell activation, proliferation, differentiation, trafficking and migration. Positively regulates T-cell trafficking to lymph-nodes via its association with ERM proteins (EZR, RDX and MSN) (By similarity). Negatively regulates Th2 cell differentiation and predisposes the differentiation of T-cells towards a Th1 lineage commitment. Promotes the expression of IFN-gamma by T-cells during T-cell receptor (TCR) activation of naive cells and induces the expression of IFN-gamma by CD4(+) T-cells and to a lesser extent by CD8(+) T-cells (PubMed:18036228). Plays a role in preparing T-cells for cytokine sensing and differentiation into effector cells by inducing the expression of cytokine receptors IFNGR and IL4R, promoting IFNGR and IL4R signaling and by mediating the clustering of IFNGR with TCR (PubMed:24328034). Acts as a major E-selectin ligand responsible for Th17 cell rolling on activated vasculature and recruitment during inflammation. Mediates Th17 cells, but not Th1 cells, adhesion to E-selectin. Acts as a T-cell counter-receptor for SIGLEC1 (By similarity).
