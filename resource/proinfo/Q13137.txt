EntryName	CACO2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium-binding and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 2 (Antigen nuclear dot 52 kDa protein) (Nuclear domain 10 protein NDP52) (Nuclear domain 10 protein 52) (Nuclear dot protein 52)
GeneName	CALCOCO2 NDP52
Length	446
Function	Xenophagy-specific receptor required for autophagy-mediated intracellular bacteria degradation. Acts as an effector protein of galectin-sensed membrane damage that restricts the proliferation of infecting pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium upon entry into the cytosol by targeting LGALS8-associated bacteria for autophagy (PubMed:22246324). Initially orchestrates bacteria targeting to autophagosomes and subsequently ensures pathogen degradation by regulating pathogen-containing autophagosome maturation (PubMed:23022382, PubMed:25771791). Bacteria targeting to autophagosomes relies on its interaction with MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B and/or GABARAPL2, whereas regulation of pathogen-containing autophagosome maturation requires the interaction with MAP3LC3C (PubMed:23022382, PubMed:25771791). May play a role in ruffle formation and actin cytoskeleton organization and seems to negatively regulate constitutive secretion (PubMed:17635994).
