UniprotID	H0YMK0
Accession	H0YMK0
EntryName	H0YMK0_HUMAN
ProteinName	ARPIN-AP3S2 readthrough
GeneName	ARPIN-AP3S2
Length	184
Function	Part of the AP-3 complex, an adaptor-related complex which is not clathrin-associated. The complex is associated with the Golgi region as well as more peripheral structures. It facilitates the budding of vesicles from the Golgi membrane and may be directly involved in trafficking to lysosomes. In concert with the BLOC-1 complex, AP-3 is required to target cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals.
