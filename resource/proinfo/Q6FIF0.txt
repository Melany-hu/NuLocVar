UniprotID	Q6FIF0
Accession	Q6FIF0;D3DW92;D3DW94;O95792;Q9BQF7;Q9GZY3
EntryName	ZFAN6_HUMAN
ProteinName	AN1-type zinc finger protein 6 (Associated with PRK1 protein) (Zinc finger A20 domain-containing protein 3)
GeneName	ZFAND6 AWP1 ZA20D3 HT032
Length	208
Function	Involved in regulation of TNF-alpha induced NF-kappa-B activation and apoptosis. Involved in modulation of 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination status of TRAF2 and decreases association of TRAF2 with RIPK1. Required for PTS1 target sequence-dependent protein import into peroxisomes and PEX5 stability; may cooperate with PEX6. In vitro involved in PEX5 export from the cytosol to peroxisomes (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
