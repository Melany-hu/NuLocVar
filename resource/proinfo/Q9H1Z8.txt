UniprotID	Q9H1Z8
Accession	Q9H1Z8;D3DVK2
EntryName	AUGN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Augurin (Esophageal cancer-related gene 4 protein) (ECRG4)
GeneName	ECRG4 C2orf40 UNQ761/PRO1508
Length	148
Function	Probable hormone that may attenuate cell proliferation and induce senescence of oligodendrocyte and neural precursor cells in the central nervous system (By similarity). ECRG4-induced senescence is characterized by G1 arrest, RB1 dephosphorylation and accelerated CCND1 and CCND3 proteasomal degradation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Cytoplasm; Apical cell membrane
