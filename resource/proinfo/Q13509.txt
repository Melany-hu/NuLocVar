GeneName	TUBB3 TUBB4
Length	450
Function	Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules, a cylinder consisting of laterally associated linear protofilaments composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers (PubMed:34996871). Microtubules grow by the addition of GTP-tubulin dimers to the microtubule end, where a stabilizing cap forms (PubMed:34996871). Below the cap, tubulin dimers are in GDP-bound state, owing to GTPase activity of alpha-tubulin (PubMed:34996871). TUBB3 plays a critical role in proper axon guidance and maintenance (PubMed:20074521). Binding of NTN1/Netrin-1 to its receptor UNC5C might cause dissociation of UNC5C from polymerized TUBB3 in microtubules and thereby lead to increased microtubule dynamics and axon repulsion (PubMed:28483977). Plays a role in dorsal root ganglion axon projection towards the spinal cord (PubMed:28483977).
