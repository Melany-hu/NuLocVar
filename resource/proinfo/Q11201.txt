ProteinName	CMP-N-acetylneuraminate-beta-galactosamide-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 1 (Alpha 2,3-ST 1) (Beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 1) (EC 2.4.3.4) (Gal-NAc6S) (Gal-beta-1,3-GalNAc-alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase) (Monosialoganglioside sialyltransferase) (EC 2.4.3.2) (SIATFL) (ST3Gal I) (ST3GalI) (ST3GalA.1) (ST3O) (Sialyltransferase 4A) (SIAT4-A)
GeneName	ST3GAL1 SIAT4 SIAT4A
Length	340
Function	A beta-galactoside alpha2->3 sialyltransferase involved in terminal sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids (PubMed:31784620, PubMed:8027041). Catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid (N-acetyl-neuraminic acid; Neu5Ac) from the nucleotide sugar donor CMP-Neu5Ac onto acceptor Galbeta-(1->3)-GalNAc-terminated glycoconjugates through an alpha2-3 linkage (PubMed:31784620, PubMed:8027041, PubMed:31719620). Adds sialic acid to the core 1 O-glycan, Galbeta-(1->3)-GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr, which is a major structure of mucin-type O-glycans. As part of a homeostatic mechanism that regulates CD8-positive T cell numbers, sialylates core 1 O-glycans of T cell glycoproteins, SPN/CD43 and PTPRC/CD45. Prevents premature apoptosis of thymic CD8-positive T cells prior to peripheral emigration, whereas in the secondary lymphoid organs controls the survival of CD8-positive memory T cells generated following a successful immune response (By similarity). Transfers sialic acid to asialofetuin, presumably onto Galbeta-(1->3)-GalNAc-O-Ser (By similarity). Sialylates GM1a, GA1 and GD1b gangliosides to form GD1a, GM1b and GT1b, respectively (By similarity) (PubMed:8027041).
