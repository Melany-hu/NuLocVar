EntryName	AL3A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 3 member A2 (EC 1.2.1.3) (EC 1.2.1.94) (Aldehyde dehydrogenase 10) (Fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase) (Microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase)
GeneName	ALDH3A2 ALDH10 FALDH
Length	485
Function	Catalyzes the oxidation of medium and long chain aliphatic aldehydes to fatty acids. Active on a variety of saturated and unsaturated aliphatic aldehydes between 6 and 24 carbons in length (PubMed:18035827, PubMed:18182499, PubMed:22633490, PubMed:25047030, PubMed:9133646, PubMed:9662422). Responsible for conversion of the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) degradation product hexadecenal to hexadecenoic acid (PubMed:22633490).
Subcellular Location	Microsome membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
