UniprotID	Q92839
Accession	Q92839;Q14470;Q9NS49
EntryName	HYAS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hyaluronan synthase 1 (EC 2.4.1.212) (Hyaluronate synthase 1) (Hyaluronic acid synthase 1) (HA synthase 1) (HuHAS1)
GeneName	HAS1 HAS
Length	578
Function	Catalyzes the addition of GlcNAc or GlcUA monosaccharides to the nascent hyaluronan polymer. Therefore, it is essential to hyaluronan synthesis a major component of most extracellular matrices that has a structural role in tissues architectures and regulates cell adhesion, migration and differentiation. This is one of the isozymes catalyzing that reaction. Also able to catalyze the synthesis of chito-oligosaccharide depending on the substrate (By similarity).
