UniprotID	P40306
Accession	P40306;B2R5J4;Q5U098
EntryName	PSB10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteasome subunit beta type-10 (EC 3.4.25.1) (Low molecular mass protein 10) (Macropain subunit MECl-1) (Multicatalytic endopeptidase complex subunit MECl-1) (Proteasome MECl-1) (Proteasome subunit beta-2i)
GeneName	PSMB10 LMP10 MECL1
Length	273
Function	The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex which is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or slightly basic pH. The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity. This subunit is involved in antigen processing to generate class I binding peptides.
