UniprotID	Q9Y3C6
Accession	Q9Y3C6;O15001;Q5TDC9
EntryName	PPIL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase-like 1 (PPIase) (EC 5.2.1.8) (Rotamase PPIL1)
GeneName	PPIL1 CYPL1 CGI-124 UNQ2425/PRO4984
Length	166
Function	Involved in pre-mRNA splicing as component of the spliceosome (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:33220177). PPIases accelerate the folding of proteins. Catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides (PubMed:16595688). Catalyzes prolyl peptide bond isomerization in CDC40/PRP17 (PubMed:33220177). Plays an important role in embryonic brain development; this function is independent of its isomerase activity (PubMed:33220177).
