UniprotID	P09211
Accession	P09211;O00460;Q15690;Q5TZY3
EntryName	GSTP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutathione S-transferase P (EC 2.5.1.18) (GST class-pi) (GSTP1-1)
GeneName	GSTP1 FAEES3 GST3
Length	210
Function	Conjugation of reduced glutathione to a wide number of exogenous and endogenous hydrophobic electrophiles. Involved in the formation of glutathione conjugates of both prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) and prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) (PubMed:9084911). Participates in the formation of novel hepoxilin regioisomers (PubMed:21046276). Negatively regulates CDK5 activity via p25/p35 translocation to prevent neurodegeneration.
