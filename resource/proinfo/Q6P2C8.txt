UniprotID	Q6P2C8
Accession	Q6P2C8;O95401;Q4F964;Q5VTA4;Q5VTA5;Q9BU57;Q9NYR4;V9GYV9
EntryName	MED27_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 27 (Cofactor required for Sp1 transcriptional activation subunit 8) (CRSP complex subunit 8) (Mediator complex subunit 27) (P37 TRAP/SMCC/PC2 subunit) (Transcriptional coactivator CRSP34)
GeneName	MED27 CRSP34 CRSP8
Length	311
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
