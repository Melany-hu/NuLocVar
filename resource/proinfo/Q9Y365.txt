UniprotID	Q9Y365
Accession	Q9Y365;O60532
EntryName	STA10_HUMAN
ProteinName	START domain-containing protein 10 (StARD10) (Antigen NY-CO-28) (PCTP-like protein) (PCTP-L) (Serologically defined colon cancer antigen 28) (StAR-related lipid transfer protein 10)
GeneName	STARD10 SDCCAG28 CGI-52
Length	291
Function	May play metabolic roles in sperm maturation or fertilization (By similarity). Phospholipid transfer protein that preferentially selects lipid species containing a palmitoyl or stearoyl chain on the sn-1 and an unsaturated fatty acyl chain (18:1 or 18:2) on the sn-2 position. Able to transfer phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidyetanolamline (PE) between membranes.
