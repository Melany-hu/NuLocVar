EntryName	ARY2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (EC 2.3.1.5) (Arylamide acetylase 2) (N-acetyltransferase type 2) (NAT-2) (N-hydroxyarylamine O-acetyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.118) (Polymorphic arylamine N-acetyltransferase) (PNAT)
GeneName	NAT2 AAC2
Length	290
Function	Catalyzes the N- or O-acetylation of various arylamine and heterocyclic amine substrates (PubMed:12222688, PubMed:7915226). Participates in the detoxification of a plethora of hydrazine and arylamine drugs, and is able to bioactivate several known carcinogens.
