UniprotID	Q9Y234
Accession	Q9Y234;Q4ZFZ1
EntryName	LIPT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lipoyl amidotransferase LIPT1, mitochondrial (EC 2.3.1.200) (Lipoate biosynthesis protein) (Lipoate-protein ligase) (Lipoyl ligase) (Lipoyltransferase 1) (EC 2.3.1.-)
GeneName	LIPT1
Length	373
Function	Lipoyl amidotransferase that catalyzes the transfer of lipoyl moieties from lipoyl-protein H of the glycine cleavage system (lipoyl-GCSH) to E2 subunits of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDCE2) (PubMed:29987032). Unable to catalyze the transfer of octanoyl from octanoyl-GCSH to PDCE2 (PubMed:29987032). In vitro, it is also able to catalyze the transfer of the lipoyl group from lipoyl-AMP to the specific lysine residue of lipoyl domains of lipoate-dependent enzymes but this reaction may not be physiologically relevant (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
