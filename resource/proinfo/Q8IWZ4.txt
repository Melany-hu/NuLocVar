UniprotID	Q8IWZ4
Accession	Q8IWZ4;Q9BUW4
EntryName	TRI48_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM48 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 101) (Tripartite motif-containing protein 48)
GeneName	TRIM48 RNF101
Length	224
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which promotes K48-linked polyubiquitination of protein methyltransferase PRMT1, leading to PRMT1 degradation (PubMed:29186683). This suppresses methylation of the PRMT1 substrate MAP3K5/ASK1, promoting its activation and increasing MAP3K5-dependent cell death induced by oxidative stress (PubMed:29186683). TRIM48-mediated ubiquitination of PRMT1 also suppresses methylation of FOXO1 by PRMT1, leading to inhibition of FOXO1 transcriptional activity (PubMed:29186683).
