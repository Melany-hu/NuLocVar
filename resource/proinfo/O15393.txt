UniprotID	O15393
Accession	O15393;A8K6Z8;B2R8E5;B7Z459;D3DSJ2;F8WES1;Q6GTK7;Q9BXX1
EntryName	TMPS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protease serine 2 (EC 3.4.21.122) (Serine protease 10) [Cleaved into: Transmembrane protease serine 2 non-catalytic chain; Transmembrane protease serine 2 catalytic chain]
GeneName	TMPRSS2 PRSS10
Length	492
Function	Plasma membrane-anchored serine protease that cleaves at arginine residues (PubMed:32703818, PubMed:35676539, PubMed:37990007, PubMed:38964328). Participates in proteolytic cascades of relevance for the normal physiologic function of the prostate (PubMed:25122198). Androgen-induced TMPRSS2 activates several substrates that include pro-hepatocyte growth factor/HGF, the protease activated receptor-2/F2RL1 or matriptase/ST14 leading to extracellular matrix disruption and metastasis of prostate cancer cells (PubMed:15537383, PubMed:25122198, PubMed:26018085). In addition, activates trigeminal neurons and contribute to both spontaneous pain and mechanical allodynia (By similarity).
