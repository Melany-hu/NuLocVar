UniprotID	Q9NX47
Accession	Q9NX47
EntryName	MARH5_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MARCHF5 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Membrane-associated RING finger protein 5) (Membrane-associated RING-CH protein V) (MARCH-V) (Mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase) (MITOL) (RING finger protein 153) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase MARCHF5)
GeneName	MARCHF5 MARCH5 RNF153
Length	278
Function	Mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a crucial role in the control of mitochondrial morphology by acting as a positive regulator of mitochondrial fission. May play a role in the prevention of cell senescence acting as a regulator of mitochondrial quality control. Promotes ubiquitination of FIS1, DNM1L and MFN1.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
