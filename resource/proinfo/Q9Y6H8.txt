EntryName	CXA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gap junction alpha-3 protein (Connexin-46) (Cx46)
GeneName	GJA3
Length	435
Function	Structural component of lens fiber gap junctions (PubMed:30044662). Gap junctions are dodecameric channels that connect the cytoplasm of adjoining cells (By similarity). They are formed by the docking of two hexameric hemichannels, one from each cell membrane. Small molecules and ions diffuse from one cell to a neighboring cell via the central pore (PubMed:30044662).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell junction; Gap junction
