UniprotID	Q53HL2
Accession	Q53HL2;D3DPT4;Q53HN1;Q96AM3;Q9NVW5
EntryName	BOREA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Borealin (Cell division cycle-associated protein 8) (Dasra-B) (hDasra-B) (Pluripotent embryonic stem cell-related gene 3 protein)
GeneName	CDCA8 PESCRG3
Length	280
Function	Component of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC), a complex that acts as a key regulator of mitosis. The CPC complex has essential functions at the centromere in ensuring correct chromosome alignment and segregation and is required for chromatin-induced microtubule stabilization and spindle assembly. Major effector of the TTK kinase in the control of attachment-error-correction and chromosome alignment.
