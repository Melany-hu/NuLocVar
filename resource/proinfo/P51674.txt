UniprotID	P51674
Accession	P51674;B7Z642;E9PHI5;Q92602
EntryName	GPM6A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuronal membrane glycoprotein M6-a (M6a)
GeneName	GPM6A M6A
Length	278
Function	Involved in neuronal differentiation, including differentiation and migration of neuronal stem cells. Plays a role in neuronal plasticity and is involved in neurite and filopodia outgrowth, filopodia motility and probably synapse formation. GPM6A-induced filopodia formation involves mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Src signaling pathways. May be involved in neuronal NGF-dependent Ca(2+) influx. May be involved in regulation of endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); enhances internalization and recycling of mu-type opioid receptor.
