Function	Transports adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and possibly other nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) from cytosol to the extracellular space. Mainly regulates their levels locally in peripheral tissues while playing a minor systemic role. Prevents abnormal ectopic mineralization of the joints by regulating the extracellular levels of the calcification inhibitor inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), which originates from the conversion of extracellular NTPs to NMPs and PPis by ENPP1 (PubMed:20943778, PubMed:32639996, PubMed:35147247). Regulates the release of the TCA cycle intermediates to the extracellular space, in particular citrate, succinate and malate. Extracellular citrate mostly present in bone tissue is required for osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, stabilization of hydroxyapatite structure and overall bone strength (PubMed:32639996). The transport mechanism remains to be elucidated (Probable).
