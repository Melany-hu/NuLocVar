UniprotID	Q9BUN5
Accession	Q9BUN5;A8K789;Q8TBV8
EntryName	CC28B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 28B
GeneName	CCDC28B
Length	200
Function	Involved in ciliogenesis. Regulates cilia length through its interaction with MAPKAP1/SIN1 but independently of mTORC2 complex. Modulates mTORC2 complex assembly and function, possibly enhances AKT1 phosphorylation. Does not seem to modulate assembly and function of mTORC1 complex.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome
