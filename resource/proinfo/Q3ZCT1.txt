UniprotID	Q3ZCT1
Accession	Q3ZCT1;Q0VF43
EntryName	ZN260_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein 260 (Zfp-260)
GeneName	ZNF260 ZFP260
Length	412
Function	Transcription factor that acts as a cardiac regulator and an effector of alpha1-adrenergic signaling. Binds to PE response elements (PERE) present in the promoter of genes such as ANF/NPPA and acts as a direct transcriptional activator of NPPA. Also acts as a cofactor with GATA4, a key cardiac regulator (By similarity).
