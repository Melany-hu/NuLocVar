UniprotID	Q8WVE7
Accession	Q8WVE7;B2R4R3;B4DPS4;D3DUK2;Q7Z6F3
EntryName	T170A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 170A
GeneName	TMEM170A TMEM170
Length	144
Function	Acts as a regulator of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (NE) morphogenesis. Affects the ratio between tubular ER and ER sheets by promoting sheet formation at the expense of tubules. Influences NE expansion, nuclear pore complex formation and proper localization of inner nuclear membrane proteins (PubMed:26906412).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Nucleus envelope
