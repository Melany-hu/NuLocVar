UniprotID	O75380
Accession	O75380
EntryName	NDUS6_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 6, mitochondrial (Complex I-13kD-A) (CI-13kD-A) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 13 kDa-A subunit)
GeneName	NDUFS6
Length	124
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
