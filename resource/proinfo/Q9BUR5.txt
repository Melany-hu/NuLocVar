UniprotID	Q9BUR5
Accession	Q9BUR5;B2R4K9;Q9H3J9
EntryName	MIC26_HUMAN
ProteinName	MICOS complex subunit MIC26 (Apolipoprotein O) (MICOS complex subunit MIC23) (Protein FAM121B)
GeneName	APOO FAM121B MIC23 MIC26 My025 UNQ1866/PRO4302
Length	198
Function	Component of the MICOS complex, a large protein complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane that plays crucial roles in the maintenance of crista junctions, inner membrane architecture, and formation of contact sites to the outer membrane. Plays a crucial role in crista junction formation and mitochondrial function (PubMed:25764979). Can promote cardiac lipotoxicity by enhancing mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid metabolism in cardiac myoblasts (PubMed:24743151). Promotes cholesterol efflux from macrophage cells. Detected in HDL, LDL and VLDL. Secreted by a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP)-dependent mechanism, probably as a VLDL-associated protein that is subsequently transferred to HDL (PubMed:16956892).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Secreted; Mitochondrion; Golgi apparatus membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
