EntryName	CALCR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcitonin receptor (CT-R)
GeneName	CALCR
Length	474
Function	G protein-coupled receptor activated by ligand peptides amylin (IAPP), calcitonin (CT/CALCA) and calcitonin gene-related peptide type 1 (CGRP1/CALCA) (PubMed:35324283, PubMed:38603770). CALCR interacts with receptor-activity-modifying proteins RAMP1, 2 and 3 to form receptor complexes AMYR1, 2 and 3, respectively (PubMed:35324283, PubMed:38603770). IAPP, CT and CGRP1 activate CALCR and AMYRs with distinct modes of receptor activation resulting in specific phenotypes (PubMed:35324283, PubMed:38603770). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors. Activates cAMP-dependent pathway (PubMed:35324283, PubMed:7476993).
