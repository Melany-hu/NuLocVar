EntryName	HAT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone acetyltransferase type B catalytic subunit (EC 2.3.1.48) (Histone acetyltransferase 1)
GeneName	HAT1 KAT1
Length	419
Function	Histone acetyltransferase that plays a role in different biological processes including cell cycle progression, glucose metabolism, histone production or DNA damage repair (PubMed:20953179, PubMed:23653357, PubMed:31278053, PubMed:32081014). Coordinates histone production and acetylation via H4 promoter binding (PubMed:31278053). Acetylates histone H4 at 'Lys-5' (H4K5ac) and 'Lys-12' (H4K12ac) and, to a lesser extent, histone H2A at 'Lys-5' (H2AK5ac) (PubMed:11585814, PubMed:22615379). Drives H4 production by chromatin binding to support chromatin replication and acetylation. Since transcription of H4 genes is tightly coupled to S-phase, plays an important role in S-phase entry and progression (PubMed:31278053). Promotes homologous recombination in DNA repair by facilitating histone turnover and incorporation of acetylated H3.3 at sites of double-strand breaks (PubMed:23653357). In addition, acetylates other substrates such as chromatin-related proteins (PubMed:32081014). Also acetylates RSAD2 which mediates the interaction of ubiquitin ligase UBE4A with RSAD2 leading to RSAD2 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (PubMed:31812350).
