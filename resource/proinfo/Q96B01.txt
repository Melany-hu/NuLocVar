EntryName	R51A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RAD51-associated protein 1 (HsRAD51AP1) (RAD51-interacting protein)
GeneName	RAD51AP1 PIR51
Length	352
Function	Structure-specific DNA-binding protein involved in DNA repair by promoting RAD51-mediated homologous recombination (PubMed:17996710, PubMed:17996711, PubMed:20871616, PubMed:25288561, PubMed:26323318). Acts by stimulating D-Loop formation by RAD51: specifically enhances joint molecule formation through its structure-specific DNA interaction and its interaction with RAD51 (PubMed:17996710, PubMed:17996711). Binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and secondary DNA structures, such as D-loop structures: has a strong preference for branched-DNA structures that are obligatory intermediates during joint molecule formation (PubMed:17996710, PubMed:17996711, PubMed:22375013, PubMed:9396801). Cooperates with WDR48/UAF1 to stimulate RAD51-mediated homologous recombination: both WDR48/UAF1 and RAD51AP1 have coordinated role in DNA-binding during homologous recombination and DNA repair (PubMed:27239033, PubMed:27463890, PubMed:32350107). WDR48/UAF1 and RAD51AP1 also have a coordinated role in DNA-binding to promote USP1-mediated deubiquitination of FANCD2 (PubMed:31253762). Also involved in meiosis by promoting DMC1-mediated homologous meiotic recombination (PubMed:21307306). Key mediator of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway, a homology-directed repair mechanism of telomere elongation that controls proliferation in aggressive cancers, by stimulating homologous recombination (PubMed:31400850). May also bind RNA; additional evidences are however required to confirm RNA-binding in vivo (PubMed:9396801).
