UniprotID	Q93079
Accession	Q93079;B2R541;Q4VB74
EntryName	H2B1H_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type 1-H (H2B-clustered histone 9) (Histone H2B.j) (H2B/j)
GeneName	H2BC9 H2BFJ HIST1H2BH
Length	126
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
