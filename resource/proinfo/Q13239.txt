UniprotID	Q13239
Accession	Q13239;B7Z4J2;B7Z4L6;Q6FI01;Q9UMQ8
EntryName	SLAP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Src-like-adapter (Src-like-adapter protein 1) (SLAP-1) (hSLAP)
GeneName	SLA SLAP SLAP1
Length	276
Function	Adapter protein, which negatively regulates T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Inhibits T-cell antigen-receptor induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells. Involved in the negative regulation of positive selection and mitosis of T-cells. May act by linking signaling proteins such as ZAP70 with CBL, leading to a CBL dependent degradation of signaling proteins.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Endosome
