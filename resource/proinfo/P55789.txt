UniprotID	P55789
Accession	P55789;Q53YM6;Q8TAH6;Q9H290;Q9UK40
EntryName	ALR_HUMAN
ProteinName	FAD-linked sulfhydryl oxidase ALR (EC 1.8.3.2) (Augmenter of liver regeneration) (hERV1) (Hepatopoietin)
GeneName	GFER ALR HERV1 HPO
Length	205
Function	FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase that regenerates the redox-active disulfide bonds in CHCHD4/MIA40, a chaperone essential for disulfide bond formation and protein folding in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The reduced form of CHCHD4/MIA40 forms a transient intermolecular disulfide bridge with GFER/ERV1, resulting in regeneration of the essential disulfide bonds in CHCHD4/MIA40, while GFER/ERV1 becomes re-oxidized by donating electrons to cytochrome c or molecular oxygen.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion intermembrane space; Mitochondrion; Cytoplasm; Secreted
