UniprotID	Q9UQV4
Accession	Q9UQV4;D3DNS4;O94781;Q8NEC8
EntryName	LAMP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 3 (LAMP-3) (Lysosomal-associated membrane protein 3) (DC-lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein) (DC LAMP) (Protein TSC403) (CD antigen CD208)
GeneName	LAMP3 DCLAMP TSC403
Length	416
Function	Lysosomal membrane glycoprotein which plays a role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) that contributes to protein degradation and cell survival during proteasomal dysfunction (PubMed:25681212). Plays a role in the process of fusion of the lysosome with the autophagosome, thereby modulating the autophagic process (PubMed:24434718). Promotes hepatocellular lipogenesis through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (PubMed:29056532). May also play a role in dendritic cell function and in adaptive immunity (PubMed:9768752).
Subcellular Location	Cell surface; Lysosome membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Early endosome membrane
