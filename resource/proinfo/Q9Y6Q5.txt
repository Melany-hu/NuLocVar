UniprotID	Q9Y6Q5
Accession	Q9Y6Q5;B2RDV5;Q9BSI8
EntryName	AP1M2_HUMAN
ProteinName	AP-1 complex subunit mu-2 (AP-mu chain family member mu1B) (Adaptor protein complex AP-1 subunit mu-2) (Adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit mu-2) (Clathrin assembly protein complex 1 mu-2 medium chain 2) (Golgi adaptor HA1/AP1 adaptin mu-2 subunit) (Mu-adaptin 2) (Mu1B-adaptin)
GeneName	AP1M2
Length	423
Function	Subunit of clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1 that plays a role in protein sorting in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. The AP complexes mediate the recruitment of clathrin to membranes and the recognition of sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane
