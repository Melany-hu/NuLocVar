Function	May have an important role in maintaining nuclear envelope structure by organizing protein complexes at the inner nuclear membrane. Required for retaining emerin at the inner nuclear membrane (By similarity). Plays a role in the modulation of innate immune signaling through the cGAS-STING pathway by interacting with RNF26 (PubMed:32614325). In addition, functions as a critical signaling component in mediating NF-kappa-B activation by acting downstream of EGFR and upstream of CARD10 (PubMed:27991920). Contributes to passive conductance current in cochlear glia-like supporting cells, mediated by gap junctions and necessary for hearing and speech discrimination (PubMed:34050020).
