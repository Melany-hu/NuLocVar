UniprotID	Q6NVU6
Accession	Q6NVU6;A0A5F9ZGY7;A4D2E4;A8K8V2;B6ZDG6;Q9BXP6
EntryName	UFSP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ufm1-specific protease 1 (UfSP1) (EC 3.4.22.-)
GeneName	UFSP1
Length	218
Function	Thiol-dependent isopeptidase that specifically mediate the processing of UFM1 precursors as well as the deconjugation of UFM1 from target proteins (PubMed:35525273, PubMed:35926457). Mainly responsible for the maturation of the UFM1 precursor, a prerequisite for conjugation reactions (PubMed:35525273, PubMed:35926457).
