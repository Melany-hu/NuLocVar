GeneName	B3GNT3 B3GALT8 TMEM3 UNQ637/PRO1266
Length	372
Function	Beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase involved in the synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine. Has activity for type 2 oligosaccharides (PubMed:11042166). Also acts as a core1-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (Core1-beta3GlcNAcT) to form the 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis x on extended core1 O-glycans (PubMed:11439191).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
