UniprotID	Q8NBI2
Accession	Q8NBI2;B3KPU2;B4DLN9;J3KQH4;Q6PK96
EntryName	CYAC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysosomal membrane ascorbate-dependent ferrireductase CYB561A3 (EC 7.2.1.3) (Cytochrome b ascorbate-dependent protein 3) (Cytochrome b561 family member A3) (Lysosomal cytochrome b) (LCytb)
GeneName	CYB561A3 CYBASC3 PSEC0259
Length	242
Function	Transmembrane reductase that uses ascorbate as an electron donor in the cytoplasm and transfers electrons across membranes to reduce iron cations Fe(3+) into Fe(2+) in the lumen of the late endosome and lysosome. Reduced iron can then be extruded from the late endosome and lysosome to the cytoplasm by divalent metal-specific transporters. It is therefore most probably involved in endosomal and lysosomal cellular iron homeostasis.
Subcellular Location	Late endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane
