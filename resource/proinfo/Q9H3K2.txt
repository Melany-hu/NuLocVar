EntryName	GHITM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Growth hormone-inducible transmembrane protein (Dermal papilla-derived protein 2) (Mitochondrial morphology and cristae structure 1) (MICS1) (Transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif-containing protein 5)
GeneName	GHITM DERP2 MICS1 TMBIM5 My021 UNQ244/PRO281
Length	345
Function	Plays an important role in maintenance of mitochondrial morphology and in mediating either calcium or potassium/proton antiport (PubMed:18417609, PubMed:32977469, PubMed:35912435, PubMed:36321428). Mediates proton-dependent calcium efflux from mitochondrion (PubMed:35912435, PubMed:36321428). Also functions as an electroneutral mitochondrial proton/potassium exchanger (PubMed:36321428). Required for the mitochondrial tubular network and cristae organization (PubMed:18417609, PubMed:32977469, PubMed:36321428). Involved in apoptotic release of cytochrome c (PubMed:18417609). Inhibits the proteolytic activity of AFG3L2, stimulating respiration and stabilizing respiratory enzymes in actively respiring mitochondria (PubMed:36321428). However, when mitochondria become hyperpolarized, GHITM loses its inhibitory activity toward AFG3L2 and the now the active AFG3L2 turns first on GHITM and, if hyperpolarization persists, on other proteins of the mitochondria, leading to a broad remodeling of the mitochondrial proteome (PubMed:36321428).
