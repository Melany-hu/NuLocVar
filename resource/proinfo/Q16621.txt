UniprotID	Q16621
Accession	Q16621;Q07720;Q6ICV9
EntryName	NFE2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor NF-E2 45 kDa subunit (Leucine zipper protein NF-E2) (Nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2 45 kDa subunit) (p45 NF-E2)
GeneName	NFE2
Length	373
Function	Component of the NF-E2 complex essential for regulating erythroid and megakaryocytic maturation and differentiation. Binds to the hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) of the beta-globin control region (LCR). This subunit (NFE2) recognizes the TCAT/C sequence of the AP-1-like core palindrome present in a number of erythroid and megakaryocytic gene promoters. Requires MAFK or other small MAF proteins for binding to the NF-E2 motif. May play a role in all aspects of hemoglobin production from globin and heme synthesis to procurement of iron.
