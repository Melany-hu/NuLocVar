UniprotID	P22557
Accession	P22557;A8K3F0;A8K6C4;Q13735;Q5JZF5;Q8N6H3
EntryName	HEM0_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-aminolevulinate synthase, erythroid-specific, mitochondrial (ALAS-E) (EC 2.3.1.37) (5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 2) (Delta-ALA synthase 2) (Delta-aminolevulinate synthase 2)
GeneName	ALAS2 ALASE ASB
Length	587
Function	Catalyzes the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent condensation of succinyl-CoA and glycine to form aminolevulinic acid (ALA), with CoA and CO2 as by-products (PubMed:14643893, PubMed:21252495, PubMed:21309041, PubMed:21653323, PubMed:32499479, PubMed:34492704). Contributes significantly to heme formation during erythropoiesis (PubMed:2050125).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane; Mitochondrion inner membrane
