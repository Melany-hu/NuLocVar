UniprotID	Q9NRP4
Accession	Q9NRP4;A4D1J3;Q75MD6
EntryName	SDHF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 3, mitochondrial (SDH assembly factor 3) (SDHAF3)
GeneName	SDHAF3 ACN9 DC11
Length	125
Function	Plays an essential role in the assembly of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), an enzyme complex (also referred to as respiratory complex II) that is a component of both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and which couples the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with the reduction of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) to ubiquinol. Promotes maturation of the iron-sulfur protein subunit SDHB of the SDH catalytic dimer, protecting it from the deleterious effects of oxidants. May act together with SDHAF1.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
