UniprotID	O95139
Accession	O95139;A8K0Y7;Q5VYT2;Q6IB84
EntryName	NDUB6_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 6 (Complex I-B17) (CI-B17) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase B17 subunit)
GeneName	NDUFB6
Length	128
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
