UniprotID	P63211
Accession	P63211;A4D1H2;O43835;Q08447;Q16026;Q6LCP6
EntryName	GBG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(T) subunit gamma-T1 (Transducin gamma chain)
GeneName	GNGT1
Length	74
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
