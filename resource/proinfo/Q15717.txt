EntryName	ELAV1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ELAV-like protein 1 (Hu-antigen R) (HuR)
GeneName	ELAVL1 HUR
Length	326
Function	RNA-binding protein that binds to the 3'-UTR region of mRNAs and increases their stability (PubMed:14517288, PubMed:18285462, PubMed:31358969). Involved in embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation: preferentially binds mRNAs that are not methylated by N6-methyladenosine (m6A), stabilizing them, promoting ESC differentiation (By similarity). Has also been shown to be capable of binding to m6A-containing mRNAs and contributes to MYC stability by binding to m6A-containing MYC mRNAs (PubMed:32245947). Binds to poly-U elements and AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3'-UTR of target mRNAs (PubMed:14731398, PubMed:17632515, PubMed:18285462, PubMed:23519412, PubMed:8626503). Binds avidly to the AU-rich element in FOS and IL3/interleukin-3 mRNAs. In the case of the FOS AU-rich element, binds to a core element of 27 nucleotides that contain AUUUA, AUUUUA, and AUUUUUA motifs. Binds preferentially to the 5'-UUUUUUU-3' motif in vitro (PubMed:8626503). With ZNF385A, binds the 3'-UTR of p53/TP53 mRNA to control their nuclear export induced by CDKN2A. Hence, may regulate p53/TP53 expression and mediate in part the CDKN2A anti-proliferative activity. May also bind with ZNF385A the CCNB1 mRNA (By similarity). Increases the stability of the leptin mRNA harboring an AU-rich element (ARE) in its 3' UTR (PubMed:29180010).
