UniprotID	O75907
Accession	O75907;B2RWQ2;D3DWL6;Q96BB8
EntryName	DGAT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (EC 2.3.1.20) (ACAT-related gene product 1) (Acyl-CoA retinol O-fatty-acyltransferase) (ARAT) (Retinol O-fatty-acyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.76) (Diglyceride acyltransferase)
GeneName	DGAT1 AGRP1 DGAT
Length	488
Function	Catalyzes the terminal and only committed step in triacylglycerol synthesis by using diacylglycerol and fatty acyl CoA as substrates (PubMed:16214399, PubMed:18768481, PubMed:28420705, PubMed:32433610, PubMed:32433611, PubMed:9756920). Highly expressed in epithelial cells of the small intestine and its activity is essential for the absorption of dietary fats (PubMed:18768481). In liver, plays a role in esterifying exogenous fatty acids to glycerol, and is required to synthesize fat for storage (PubMed:16214399). Also present in female mammary glands, where it produces fat in the milk (By similarity). May be involved in VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) assembly (PubMed:18768481). In contrast to DGAT2 it is not essential for survival (By similarity). Functions as the major acyl-CoA retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) in the skin, where it acts to maintain retinoid homeostasis and prevent retinoid toxicity leading to skin and hair disorders (PubMed:16214399). Exhibits additional acyltransferase activities, includin acyl CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT), wax monoester and wax diester synthases (By similarity). Also able to use 1-monoalkylglycerol (1-MAkG) as an acyl acceptor for the synthesis of monoalkyl-monoacylglycerol (MAMAG) (PubMed:28420705).
