UniprotID	Q02833
Accession	Q02833;G5E9N9;Q3KP41;Q3KP42
EntryName	RASF7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras association domain-containing protein 7 (HRAS1-related cluster protein 1)
GeneName	RASSF7 C11orf13 HRC1
Length	373
Function	Negatively regulates stress-induced JNK activation and apoptosis by promoting MAP2K7 phosphorylation and inhibiting its ability to activate JNK. Following prolonged stress, anti-apoptotic effect stops because of degradation of RASSF7 protein via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Required for the activation of AURKB and chromosomal congression during mitosis where it stimulates microtubule polymerization.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome
