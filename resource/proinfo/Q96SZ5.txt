UniprotID	Q96SZ5
Accession	Q96SZ5;B1AL29
EntryName	AEDO_HUMAN
ProteinName	2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.19) (Cysteamine dioxygenase)
GeneName	ADO C10orf22
Length	270
Function	Plays a vital role in regulating thiol metabolism and preserving oxygen homeostasis by oxidizing the sulfur of cysteamine and N-terminal cysteine-containing proteins to their corresponding sulfinic acids using O2 as a cosubstrate (PubMed:17581819, PubMed:29752763, PubMed:31273118, PubMed:32601061). Catalyzes the oxidation of cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol) to hypotaurine (PubMed:17581819, PubMed:29752763, PubMed:32601061). Catalyzes the oxidation of regulators of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) and 5 (RGS5) and interleukin-32 (IL32) (PubMed:31273118, PubMed:32601061).
