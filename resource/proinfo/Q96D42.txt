UniprotID	Q96D42
Accession	Q96D42;O43656
EntryName	HAVR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (HAVcr-1) (Kidney injury molecule 1) (KIM-1) (T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 1) (TIMD-1) (T-cell immunoglobulin mucin receptor 1) (TIM) (TIM-1) (T-cell membrane protein 1) (CD antigen CD365)
GeneName	HAVCR1 KIM1 TIM1 TIMD1
Length	364
Function	Phosphatidylserine receptor that plays an important functional role in regulatory B-cells homeostasis including generation, expansion and suppressor functions (By similarity). As P-selectin/SELPLG ligand, plays a specialized role in activated but not naive T-cell trafficking during inflammatory responses (PubMed:24703780). Controls thereby T-cell accumulation in the inflamed central nervous system (CNS) and the induction of autoimmune disease (PubMed:24703780). Also regulates expression of various anti-inflammatory cytokines and co-inhibitory ligands including IL10 (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of T-cell proliferation (By similarity). May play a role in kidney injury and repair (PubMed:17471468).
