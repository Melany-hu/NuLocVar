UniprotID	Q8TEZ7
Accession	Q8TEZ7;B2RCF6;Q86WL0;Q8N6D3;Q9HD02
EntryName	PAQR8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Membrane progestin receptor beta (mPR beta) (Lysosomal membrane protein in brain 1) (Membrane progesterone P4 receptor beta) (Membrane progesterone receptor beta) (Progesterone and adipoQ receptor family member 8) (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 8) (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member VIII)
GeneName	PAQR8 C6orf33 LMPB1 MPRB
Length	354
Function	Plasma membrane progesterone (P4) receptor coupled to G proteins (PubMed:23763432). Seems to act through a G(i) mediated pathway (PubMed:23763432). May be involved in oocyte maturation (By similarity). Also binds dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), pregnanolone, pregnenolone and allopregnanolone (PubMed:23161870).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
