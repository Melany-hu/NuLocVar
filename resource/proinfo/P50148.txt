EntryName	GNAQ_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) subunit alpha (EC 3.6.5.-) (Guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha-q)
GeneName	GNAQ GAQ
Length	359
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in numerous signaling cascades (PubMed:37991948). The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (PubMed:37991948). Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding (PubMed:37991948). The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal (PubMed:37991948). Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numerous regulatory proteins (PubMed:37991948). Signaling is mediated via phospholipase C-beta-dependent inositol lipid hydrolysis for signal propagation: activates phospholipase C-beta: following GPCR activation, GNAQ activates PLC-beta (PLCB1, PLCB2, PLCB3 or PLCB4), leading to production of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (PubMed:37991948). Required for platelet activation (By similarity). Regulates B-cell selection and survival and is required to prevent B-cell-dependent autoimmunity (By similarity). Regulates chemotaxis of BM-derived neutrophils and dendritic cells (in vitro) (By similarity). Transduces FFAR4 signaling in response to long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) (PubMed:27852822). Together with GNA11, required for heart development (By similarity).
