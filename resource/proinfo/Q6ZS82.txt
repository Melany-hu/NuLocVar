UniprotID	Q6ZS82
Accession	Q6ZS82;Q6ZVJ6
EntryName	R9BP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of G-protein signaling 9-binding protein (RGS9-anchoring protein)
GeneName	RGS9BP R9AP
Length	235
Function	Regulator of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in phototransduction. Participates in the recovery phase of visual transduction via its interaction with RGS9-1 isoform. Acts as a membrane-anchor that mediates the targeting of RGS9-1 to the photoreceptor outer segment, where phototransduction takes place. Enhances the ability of RGS9-1 to stimulate G protein GTPase activity, allowing the visual signal to be terminated on the physiologically time scale. It also controls the proteolytic stability of RGS9-1, probably by protecting it from degradation (By similarity).
