UniprotID	Q9BQ51
Accession	Q9BQ51;Q14CN8;Q5T7Z6;Q6JXL8;Q6JXL9
EntryName	PD1L2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-1 ligand 2) (PD-L2) (PDCD1 ligand 2) (Programmed death ligand 2) (Butyrophilin B7-DC) (B7-DC) (CD antigen CD273)
GeneName	PDCD1LG2 B7DC CD273 PDCD1L2 PDL2
Length	273
Function	Involved in the costimulatory signal, essential for T-cell proliferation and IFNG production in a PDCD1-independent manner. Interaction with PDCD1 inhibits T-cell proliferation by blocking cell cycle progression and cytokine production (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Endomembrane system; Cell membrane
