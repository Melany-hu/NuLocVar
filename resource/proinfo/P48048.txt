ProteinName	ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 1 (ATP-regulated potassium channel ROM-K) (Inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir1.1) (Potassium channel, inwardly rectifying subfamily J member 1)
GeneName	KCNJ1 ROMK1
Length	391
Function	Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium. This channel is activated by internal ATP and can be blocked by external barium. In the kidney, probably plays a major role in potassium homeostasis.
