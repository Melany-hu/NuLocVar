EntryName	CSN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	COP9 signalosome complex subunit 2 (SGN2) (Signalosome subunit 2) (Alien homolog) (JAB1-containing signalosome subunit 2) (Thyroid receptor-interacting protein 15) (TR-interacting protein 15) (TRIP-15)
GeneName	COPS2 CSN2 TRIP15
Length	443
Function	Essential component of the COP9 signalosome complex (CSN), a complex involved in various cellular and developmental processes. The CSN complex is an essential regulator of the ubiquitin (Ubl) conjugation pathway by mediating the deneddylation of the cullin subunits of SCF-type E3 ligase complexes, leading to decrease the Ubl ligase activity of SCF-type complexes such as SCF, CSA or DDB2. The complex is also involved in phosphorylation of p53/TP53, c-jun/JUN, IkappaBalpha/NFKBIA, ITPK1 and IRF8/ICSBP, possibly via its association with CK2 and PKD kinases. CSN-dependent phosphorylation of TP53 and JUN promotes and protects degradation by the Ubl system, respectively. Involved in early stage of neuronal differentiation via its interaction with NIF3L1.
