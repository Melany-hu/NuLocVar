UniprotID	Q5T9L3
Accession	Q5T9L3;B2RNT2;Q5JRS7;Q7Z2Z9;Q8NC43
EntryName	WLS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein wntless homolog (Integral membrane protein GPR177) (Protein evenness interrupted homolog) (EVI) (Putative NF-kappa-B-activating protein 373)
GeneName	WLS C1orf139 GPR177 UNQ85/PRO18667
Length	541
Function	Regulates Wnt proteins sorting and secretion in a feedback regulatory mechanism. This reciprocal interaction plays a key role in the regulation of expression, subcellular location, binding and organelle-specific association of Wnt proteins (PubMed:34587386). Plays also an important role in establishment of the anterior-posterior body axis formation during development (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Cell membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Early endosome membrane
