UniprotID	P50395
Accession	P50395;O43928;Q5SX88;Q9UQM6
EntryName	GDIB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor beta (Rab GDI beta) (Guanosine diphosphate dissociation inhibitor 2) (GDI-2)
GeneName	GDI2 RABGDIB
Length	445
Function	GDP-dissociation inhibitor preventing the GDP to GTP exchange of most Rab proteins. By keeping these small GTPases in their inactive GDP-bound form regulates intracellular membrane trafficking (PubMed:25860027). Negatively regulates protein transport to the cilium and ciliogenesis through the inhibition of RAB8A (PubMed:25860027).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Membrane; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network
