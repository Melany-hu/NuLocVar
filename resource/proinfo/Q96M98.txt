UniprotID	Q96M98
Accession	Q96M98;E1P5B5;Q6IMB8;Q8IZM1;Q8NHP5;Q9H1V9
EntryName	PACRG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Parkin coregulated gene protein (Molecular chaperone/chaperonin-binding protein) (PARK2 coregulated gene protein)
GeneName	PACRG GLUP
Length	296
Function	Microtubule inner protein (MIP) part of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in cilia axoneme, which is required for motile cilia beating (PubMed:36191189). Suppresses cell death induced by accumulation of unfolded Pael receptor (Pael-R, a substrate of Parkin) (PubMed:14532270). Facilitates the formation of inclusions consisting of Pael-R, molecular chaperones, protein degradation molecules and itself when proteasome is inhibited (PubMed:14532270). May play an important role in the formation of Lewy bodies and protection of dopaminergic neurons against Parkinson disease (PubMed:14532270).
