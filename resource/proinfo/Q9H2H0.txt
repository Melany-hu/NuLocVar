UniprotID	Q9H2H0
Accession	Q9H2H0
EntryName	CXXC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	CXXC-type zinc finger protein 4 (Inhibition of the Dvl and axin complex protein)
GeneName	CXXC4 IDAX
Length	198
Function	Acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway via its interaction with DVL1 (By similarity). Binds preferentially to DNA containing cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) dinucleotides over CpH (H=A, T, and C), hemimethylated-CpG and hemimethylated-hydroxymethyl-CpG (PubMed:29276034).
