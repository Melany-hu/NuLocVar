UniprotID	Q9H4I9
Accession	Q9H4I9;B2R5D1;Q8TAB9
EntryName	EMRE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Essential MCU regulator, mitochondrial (Single-pass membrane protein with aspartate-rich tail 1, mitochondrial)
GeneName	SMDT1 C22orf32 EMRE
Length	107
Function	Essential regulatory subunit of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex (uniplex), a complex that mediates calcium uptake into mitochondria (PubMed:24231807, PubMed:26774479, PubMed:27099988, PubMed:30454562, PubMed:31080062, PubMed:32315830, PubMed:32494073, PubMed:32762847, PubMed:32790952, PubMed:33296646). Required to bridge the calcium-sensing proteins MICU1 with the calcium-conducting subunit MCU (PubMed:24231807, PubMed:30454562, PubMed:32494073, PubMed:32762847, PubMed:32790952). Acts by mediating activation of MCU and retention of MICU1 to the MCU pore, in order to ensure tight regulation of the uniplex complex and appropriate responses to intracellular calcium signaling (PubMed:27099988, PubMed:31080062, PubMed:32315830, PubMed:33296646).
