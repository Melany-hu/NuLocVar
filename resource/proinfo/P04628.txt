UniprotID	P04628
Accession	P04628;Q5U0N2
EntryName	WNT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proto-oncogene Wnt-1 (Proto-oncogene Int-1 homolog)
GeneName	WNT1 INT1
Length	370
Function	Ligand for members of the frizzled family of seven transmembrane receptors (Probable). Acts in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by promoting beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation (PubMed:23499309, PubMed:23656646, PubMed:26902720, PubMed:28528193). In some developmental processes, is also a ligand for the coreceptor RYK, thus triggering Wnt signaling (By similarity). Plays an essential role in the development of the embryonic brain and central nervous system (CNS) (By similarity). Has a role in osteoblast function, bone development and bone homeostasis (PubMed:23499309, PubMed:23656646).
