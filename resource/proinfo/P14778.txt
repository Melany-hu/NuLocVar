ProteinName	Interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R-1) (IL-1RT-1) (IL-1RT1) (EC 3.2.2.6) (CD121 antigen-like family member A) (Interleukin-1 receptor alpha) (IL-1R-alpha) (Interleukin-1 receptor type I) (p80) (CD antigen CD121a) [Cleaved into: Interleukin-1 receptor type 1, membrane form (mIL-1R1) (mIL-1RI); Interleukin-1 receptor type 1, soluble form (sIL-1R1) (sIL-1RI)]
GeneName	IL1R1 IL1R IL1RA IL1RT1
Length	569
Function	Receptor for IL1A, IL1B and IL1RN (PubMed:2950091, PubMed:37315560). After binding to interleukin-1 associates with the coreceptor IL1RAP to form the high affinity interleukin-1 receptor complex which mediates interleukin-1-dependent activation of NF-kappa-B, MAPK and other pathways. Signaling involves the recruitment of adapter molecules such as TOLLIP, MYD88, and IRAK1 or IRAK2 via the respective TIR domains of the receptor/coreceptor subunits. Binds ligands with comparable affinity and binding of antagonist IL1RN prevents association with IL1RAP to form a signaling complex. Involved in IL1B-mediated costimulation of IFNG production from T-helper 1 (Th1) cells (PubMed:10653850).
