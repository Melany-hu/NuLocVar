UniprotID	Q8N966
Accession	Q8N966;A6NH02;B7Z2L5;Q149P4
EntryName	ZDH22_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC22 (EC 2.3.1.225) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 22) (DHHC-22) (zDHHC22)
GeneName	ZDHHC22 C14orf59
Length	263
Function	Palmitoyltransferase that could catalyze the addition of palmitate onto various protein substrates and be involved in a variety of cellular processes (PubMed:22399288). Catalyzes the palmitoylation of KCNMA1, regulating localization of KCNMA1 to the plasma membrane (PubMed:22399288). Might also mediate palmitoylation of CNN3 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane
