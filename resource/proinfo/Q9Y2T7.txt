UniprotID	Q9Y2T7
Accession	Q9Y2T7;D3DTP1;Q8N4P0
EntryName	YBOX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Y-box-binding protein 2 (Contrin) (DNA-binding protein C) (Dbpc) (Germ cell-specific Y-box-binding protein) (MSY2 homolog)
GeneName	YBX2 CSDA3 MSY2
Length	364
Function	Major constituent of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs). Involved in the regulation of the stability and/or translation of germ cell mRNAs. Binds to Y-box consensus promoter element. Binds to full-length mRNA with high affinity in a sequence-independent manner. Binds to short RNA sequences containing the consensus site 5'-UCCAUCA-3' with low affinity and limited sequence specificity. Its binding with maternal mRNAs is necessary for its cytoplasmic retention. May mark specific mRNAs (those transcribed from Y-box promoters) in the nucleus for cytoplasmic storage, thereby linking transcription and mRNA storage/translational delay (By similarity).
