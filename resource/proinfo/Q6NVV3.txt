UniprotID	Q6NVV3
Accession	Q6NVV3;B3KTB0;Q68DA9
EntryName	NIPA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Magnesium transporter NIPA3 (NIPA-like protein 1) (Non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region protein 3)
GeneName	NIPAL1 NIPA3 NPAL1
Length	410
Function	Acts as a Mg(2+) transporter. Can also transport other divalent cations such as Fe(2+), Sr(2+), Ba(2+), Mn(2+), Cu(2+) and Co(2+) but to a much less extent than Mg(2+) (By similarity).
