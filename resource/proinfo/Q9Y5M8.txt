UniprotID	Q9Y5M8
Accession	Q9Y5M8;Q6P595;Q8N2D8
EntryName	SRPRB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal recognition particle receptor subunit beta (SR-beta) (Protein APMCF1)
GeneName	SRPRB PSEC0230
Length	271
Function	Component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) complex receptor (SR) (By similarity). Ensures, in conjunction with the SRP complex, the correct targeting of the nascent secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane system (By similarity). May mediate the membrane association of SR (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
