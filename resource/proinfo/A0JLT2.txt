UniprotID	A0JLT2
Accession	A0JLT2;Q8IV02;Q8IZD1
EntryName	MED19_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 19 (Lung cancer metastasis-related protein 1) (Mediator complex subunit 19)
GeneName	MED19 LCMR1
Length	244
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
