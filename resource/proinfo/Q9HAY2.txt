UniprotID	Q9HAY2
Accession	Q9HAY2;Q9H215
EntryName	MAGF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Melanoma-associated antigen F1 (MAGE-F1) (MAGE-F1 antigen)
GeneName	MAGEF1
Length	307
Function	Enhances ubiquitin ligase activity of RING-type zinc finger-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases. Proposed to act through recruitment and/or stabilization of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme at the E3:substrate complex. MAGEF1-NSMCE1 ubiquitin ligase complex promotes proteasomal degradation of MMS19, a key component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) machinery. Down-regulation of MMS19 impairs the activity of several DNA repair and metabolism enzymes such as ERCC2/XPD, FANCJ, RTEL1 and POLD1 that require iron-sulfur clusters as cofactors. May negatively regulate genome integrity by inhibiting homologous recombination-mediated double-strand break DNA repair (PubMed:29225034).
