EntryName	PINK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase PINK1, mitochondrial (EC 2.7.11.1) (BRPK) (PTEN-induced putative kinase protein 1)
GeneName	PINK1
Length	581
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase which acts as a sensor of mitochondrial damage and protects against mitochondrial dysfunction during cellular stress. It phosphorylates mitochondrial proteins to coordinate mitochondrial quality control mechanisms that remove and replace dysfunctional mitochondrial components (PubMed:14607334, PubMed:15087508, PubMed:18443288, PubMed:18957282, PubMed:19229105, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:20404107, PubMed:20547144, PubMed:20798600, PubMed:22396657, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:23754282, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:24660806, PubMed:24751536, PubMed:24784582, PubMed:24896179, PubMed:24898855, PubMed:25527291, PubMed:32484300). Depending on the severity of mitochondrial damage, activity ranges from preventing apoptosis and stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis to eliminating severely damaged mitochondria via PINK1-PRKN-dependent mitophagy (PubMed:14607334, PubMed:15087508, PubMed:18443288, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:20404107, PubMed:20798600, PubMed:22396657, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:24898855, PubMed:32047033, PubMed:32484300). When cellular stress results in irreversible mitochondrial damage, PINK1 accumulates at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) where it phosphorylates pre-existing polyubiquitin chains at 'Ser-65', recruits PRKN from the cytosol to the OMM and activates PRKN by phosphorylation at 'Ser-65'; activated PRKN then ubiquinates VDAC1 and other OMM proteins to initiate mitophagy (PubMed:14607334, PubMed:15087508, PubMed:19966284, PubMed:20404107, PubMed:20798600, PubMed:23754282, PubMed:23933751, PubMed:24660806, PubMed:24751536, PubMed:24784582, PubMed:25474007, PubMed:25527291, PubMed:32047033). The PINK1-PRKN pathway also promotes fission of damaged mitochondria through phosphorylation and PRKN-dependent degradation of mitochondrial proteins involved in fission such as MFN2 (PubMed:18443288, PubMed:23620051, PubMed:24898855). This prevents the refusion of unhealthy mitochondria with the mitochondrial network or initiates mitochondrial fragmentation facilitating their later engulfment by autophagosomes (PubMed:18443288, PubMed:23620051). Also promotes mitochondrial fission independently of PRKN and ATG7-mediated mitophagy, via the phosphorylation and activation of DNM1L (PubMed:18443288, PubMed:32484300). Regulates motility of damaged mitochondria by promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MIRO1 and MIRO2; in motor neurons, this likely inhibits mitochondrial intracellular anterograde transport along the axons which probably increases the chance of the mitochondria undergoing mitophagy in the soma (PubMed:22396657). Required for ubiquinone reduction by mitochondrial complex I by mediating phosphorylation of complex I subunit NDUFA10 (By similarity). Phosphorylates LETM1, positively regulating its mitochondrial calcium transport activity (PubMed:29123128).
