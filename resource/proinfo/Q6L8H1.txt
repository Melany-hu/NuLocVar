UniprotID	Q6L8H1
Accession	Q6L8H1
EntryName	KRA54_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 5-4 (Keratin-associated protein 5.4) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 5.4)
GeneName	KRTAP5-4 KAP5.4 KRTAP5.4
Length	288
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated protein (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
