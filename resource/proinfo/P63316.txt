UniprotID	P63316
Accession	P63316;O14800;P02590;P04463
EntryName	TNNC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Troponin C, slow skeletal and cardiac muscles (TN-C)
GeneName	TNNC1 TNNC
Length	161
Function	Troponin is the central regulatory protein of striated muscle contraction. Tn consists of three components: Tn-I which is the inhibitor of actomyosin ATPase, Tn-T which contains the binding site for tropomyosin and Tn-C. The binding of calcium to Tn-C abolishes the inhibitory action of Tn on actin filaments.
