UniprotID	Q4G112
Accession	Q4G112;Q08EH7;Q8N7V2
EntryName	HSF5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heat shock factor protein 5 (HSF 5) (Heat shock transcription factor 5) (HSTF 5)
GeneName	HSF5 HSTF5
Length	596
Function	DNA-binding transcription factor that is essential for male fertility, spermatogenesis and meiotic prophase progression in spermatocytes under non-stress conditions. Positvely and negatively regulates gene expression to ensure progression of meiotic prophase beyond pachytene stage in spermatocytes. Plays a role in male germline meiotic sex chromosome remodeling and silencing through regulation of SMARCA4.
