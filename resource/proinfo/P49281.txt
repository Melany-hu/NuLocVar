EntryName	NRAM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 2 (NRAMP 2) (Divalent cation transporter 1) (Divalent metal transporter 1) (DMT-1) (Solute carrier family 11 member 2)
GeneName	SLC11A2 DCT1 DMT1 NRAMP2 OK/SW-cl.20
Length	568
Function	Proton-coupled metal ion symporter operating with a proton to metal ion stoichiometry of 1:1 (PubMed:17109629, PubMed:17293870, PubMed:22736759, PubMed:25326704, PubMed:25491917). Selectively transports various divalent metal cations, in decreasing affinity: Cd(2+) > Fe(2+) > Co(2+), Mn(2+) >> Zn(2+), Ni(2+), VO(2+) (PubMed:17109629, PubMed:17293870, PubMed:22736759, PubMed:25326704, PubMed:25491917). Essential for maintenance of iron homeostasis by modulating intestinal absorption of dietary Fe(2+) and TF-associated endosomal Fe(2+) transport in erythroid precursors and other cells (By similarity). Enables Fe(2+) and Mn(2+) ion entry into mitochondria, and is thus expected to promote mitochondrial heme synthesis, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and antioxidant defense (By similarity) (PubMed:24448823). Can mediate uncoupled fluxes of either protons or metal ions.
