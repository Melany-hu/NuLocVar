UniprotID	Q15761
Accession	Q15761;Q6GTR7;Q92916
EntryName	NPY5R_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuropeptide Y receptor type 5 (NPY5-R) (NPY-Y5 receptor) (NPYY5-R) (Y5 receptor)
GeneName	NPY5R NPYR5
Length	445
Function	Receptor for neuropeptide Y and peptide YY. The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins that inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. Seems to be associated with food intake. Could be involved in feeding disorders.
