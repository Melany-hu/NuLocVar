UniprotID	P43629
Accession	P43629;O43473;Q14946;Q16541
EntryName	KI3L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 3DL1 (CD158 antigen-like family member E) (HLA-BW4-specific inhibitory NK cell receptor) (Natural killer-associated transcript 3) (NKAT-3) (p70 natural killer cell receptor clones CL-2/CL-11) (p70 NK receptor CL-2/CL-11) (CD antigen CD158e)
GeneName	KIR3DL1 CD158E NKAT3 NKB1
Length	444
Function	Receptor on natural killer (NK) cells for HLA Bw4 allele. Inhibits the activity of NK cells thus preventing cell lysis.
