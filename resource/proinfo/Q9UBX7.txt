UniprotID	Q9UBX7
Accession	Q9UBX7;O75837;Q0WXX5;Q8IXD7;Q9NS65
EntryName	KLK11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kallikrein-11 (hK11) (EC 3.4.21.-) (Hippostasin) (Serine protease 20) (Trypsin-like protease) [Cleaved into: Kallikrein-11 inactive chain 1; Kallikrein-11 inactive chain 2]
GeneName	KLK11 PRSS20 TLSP UNQ649/PRO1279
Length	282
Function	Possible multifunctional protease. Efficiently cleaves 'bz-Phe-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide', a kallikrein substrate, and weakly cleaves other substrates for kallikrein and trypsin. Cleaves synthetic peptides after arginine but not lysine residues.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Golgi apparatus; Secreted
