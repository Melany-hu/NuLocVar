UniprotID	P49006
Accession	P49006;D3DPQ0;Q5TEE6;Q6NXS5
EntryName	MRP_HUMAN
ProteinName	MARCKS-related protein (MARCKS-like protein 1) (Macrophage myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) (Mac-MARCKS) (MacMARCKS)
GeneName	MARCKSL1 MLP MRP
Length	195
Function	Controls cell movement by regulating actin cytoskeleton homeostasis and filopodium and lamellipodium formation (PubMed:22751924). When unphosphorylated, induces cell migration (By similarity). When phosphorylated by MAPK8, induces actin bundles formation and stabilization, thereby reducing actin plasticity, hence restricting cell movement, including neuronal migration (By similarity). May be involved in coupling the protein kinase C and calmodulin signal transduction systems (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cell membrane
