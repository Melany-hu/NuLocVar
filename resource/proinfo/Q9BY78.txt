ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF26 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 26)
GeneName	RNF26
Length	433
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a key role in endosome organization by retaining vesicles in the perinuclear cloud (PubMed:27368102). Acts as a platform for perinuclear positioning of the endosomal system by mediating ubiquitination of SQSTM1 through interaction with the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBE2J1 (PubMed:27368102, PubMed:33472082). Ubiquitinated SQSTM1 attracts specific vesicle-associated adapters, forming a molecular bridge that restrains cognate vesicles in the perinuclear region and organizes the endosomal pathway for efficient cargo transport (PubMed:27368102, PubMed:33472082). Also acts as a regulator of type I interferon production in response to viral infection by mediating the formation of 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitin chains on TMEM173/STING, leading to stabilize TMEM173/STING (PubMed:25254379, PubMed:32614325). Also required to limit type I interferon response by promoting autophagic degradation of IRF3 (PubMed:25254379).
