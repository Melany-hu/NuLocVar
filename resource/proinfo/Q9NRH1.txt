UniprotID	Q9NRH1
Accession	Q9NRH1;A4D1W4;B4DE83;Q6IAF7;Q8WVZ5
EntryName	YAE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein YAE1 homolog (Yae1 domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	YAE1 C7orf36 YAE1D1 GK003
Length	226
Function	The complex LTO1:YAE1 functions as a target specific adapter that probably recruits apo-ABCE1 to the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) complex machinery (PubMed:26182403). May be required for biogenesis of the large ribosomal subunit and initiation of translation (PubMed:26182403).
