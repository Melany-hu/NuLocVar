UniprotID	Q5TA76
Accession	Q5TA76
EntryName	LCE3A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Late cornified envelope protein 3A (Late envelope protein 13)
GeneName	LCE3A LEP13
Length	89
Function	A structural component of the cornified envelope of the stratum corneum involved in innate cutaneous host defense (Probable). Possesses defensin-like antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic species. Upon inflammation, may regulate skin barrier repair by shaping cutaneous microbiota composition and immune response to bacterial antigens (PubMed:28634035).
