ProteinName	3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta 5-->4-isomerase type 1 (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta 5-->4-isomerase type I) (3-beta-HSD I) (3-beta-hydroxy-5-ene steroid dehydrogenase) (3-beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-steroid dehydrogenase) (EC 1.1.1.145) (3-beta-hydroxysteroid 3-dehydrogenase) (EC 1.1.1.270) (Delta-5-3-ketosteroid isomerase) (Dihydrotestosterone oxidoreductase) (EC 1.1.1.210) (Steroid Delta-isomerase) (EC 5.3.3.1) (Trophoblast antigen FDO161G)
GeneName	HSD3B1 3BH HSDB3A
Length	373
Function	A bifunctional enzyme responsible for the oxidation and isomerization of 3beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-steroid precursors to 3-oxo-Delta(4)-steroids, an essential step in steroid hormone biosynthesis. Specifically catalyzes the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone, 17alpha-hydroxypregnenolone to 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to 4-androstenedione, and androstenediol to testosterone. Additionally, catalyzes the interconversion between 3beta-hydroxy and 3-oxo-5alpha-androstane steroids controlling the bioavalability of the active forms. Specifically converts dihydrotestosterone to its inactive form 5alpha-androstanediol, that does not bind androgen receptor/AR. Also converts androstanedione, a precursor of testosterone and estrone, to epiandrosterone (PubMed:1401999, PubMed:2139411). Expected to use NAD(+) as preferred electron donor for the 3beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase activity and NADPH for the 3-ketosteroid reductase activity (Probable).
