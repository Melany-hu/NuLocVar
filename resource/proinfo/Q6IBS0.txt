UniprotID	Q6IBS0
Accession	Q6IBS0;Q9Y3F5
EntryName	TWF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Twinfilin-2 (A6-related protein) (hA6RP) (Protein tyrosine kinase 9-like) (Twinfilin-1-like protein)
GeneName	TWF2 PTK9L MSTP011
Length	349
Function	Actin-binding protein involved in motile and morphological processes. Inhibits actin polymerization, likely by sequestering G-actin. By capping the barbed ends of filaments, it also regulates motility. Seems to play an important role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and distribution of endocytic organelles. May play a role in regulating the mature length of the middle and short rows of stereocilia (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region; Cell projection; Stereocilium
