UniprotID	Q7RTS1
Accession	Q7RTS1;A4D271;Q14DE4
EntryName	BHA15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 15 (bHLHa15) (Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 8) (bHLHb8) (Muscle, intestine and stomach expression 1) (MIST-1)
GeneName	BHLHA15 BHLHB8 MIST1
Length	189
Function	Plays a role in controlling the transcriptional activity of MYOD1, ensuring that expanding myoblast populations remain undifferentiated. Repression may occur through muscle-specific E-box occupancy by homodimers. May also negatively regulate bHLH-mediated transcription through an N-terminal repressor domain. Serves as a key regulator of acinar cell function, stability, and identity. Also required for normal organelle localization in exocrine cells and for mitochondrial calcium ion transport. May function as a unique regulator of gene expression in several different embryonic and postnatal cell lineages. Binds to the E-box consensus sequence 5'-CANNTG-3' (By similarity).
