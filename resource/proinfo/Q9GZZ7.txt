UniprotID	Q9GZZ7
Accession	Q9GZZ7;Q5JT74;Q9H191;Q9H192
EntryName	GFRA4_HUMAN
ProteinName	GDNF family receptor alpha-4 (GDNF receptor alpha-4) (GDNFR-alpha-4) (GFR-alpha-4) (Persephin receptor)
GeneName	GFRA4
Length	299
Function	Receptor for persephin (PSPN), a growth factor that exhibits neurotrophic activity on mesencephalic dopaminergic and motor neurons (PubMed:11116144). Acts by binding to its coreceptor, GFRA4, leading to autophosphorylation and activation of the RET receptor (PubMed:11116144). May be important in C-cell development and, in the postnatal development of the adrenal medulla (PubMed:11116144).
