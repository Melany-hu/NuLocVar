EntryName	ANGL4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Angiopoietin-related protein 4 (Angiopoietin-like protein 4) (Hepatic fibrinogen/angiopoietin-related protein) (HFARP) [Cleaved into: ANGPTL4 N-terminal chain; ANGPTL4 C-terminal chain]
GeneName	ANGPTL4 ARP4 HFARP PGAR PP1158 PSEC0166 UNQ171/PRO197
Length	406
Function	Mediates inactivation of the lipoprotein lipase LPL, and thereby plays a role in the regulation of triglyceride clearance from the blood serum and in lipid metabolism (PubMed:19270337, PubMed:21398697, PubMed:27929370, PubMed:29899144). May also play a role in regulating glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (Probable). Inhibits proliferation, migration, and tubule formation of endothelial cells and reduces vascular leakage (PubMed:14583458, PubMed:17068295). Upon heterologous expression, inhibits the adhesion of endothelial cell to the extracellular matrix (ECM), and inhibits the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions in endothelial cells that have adhered to ANGPTL4-containing ECM (in vitro) (PubMed:17068295). Depending on context, may modulate tumor-related angiogenesis (By similarity).
