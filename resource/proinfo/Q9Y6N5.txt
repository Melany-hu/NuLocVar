ProteinName	Sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, mitochondrial (SQOR) (EC 1.8.5.8) (Sulfide dehydrogenase-like) (Sulfide quinone oxidoreductase)
GeneName	SQOR SQRDL CGI-44
Length	450
Function	Catalyzes the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide with the help of a quinone, such as ubiquinone-10, giving rise to thiosulfate and ultimately to sulfane (molecular sulfur) atoms. Requires an additional electron acceptor; can use sulfite, sulfide or cyanide (in vitro) (PubMed:22852582). It is believed the in vivo electron acceptor is glutathione (PubMed:25225291, PubMed:29715001).
