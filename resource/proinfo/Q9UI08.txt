Accession	Q9UI08;A8K105;B7Z3I5;O95884;Q7Z522;Q8TBV1;Q9UF25;Q9UIC2
EntryName	EVL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ena/VASP-like protein (Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-like)
GeneName	EVL RNB6
Length	416
Function	Ena/VASP proteins are actin-associated proteins involved in a range of processes dependent on cytoskeleton remodeling and cell polarity such as axon guidance and lamellipodial and filopodial dynamics in migrating cells. EVL enhances actin nucleation and polymerization.
