UniprotID	P58546
Accession	P58546
EntryName	MTPN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myotrophin (Protein V-1)
GeneName	MTPN
Length	118
Function	Promotes dimerization of NF-kappa-B subunits and regulates NF-kappa-B transcription factor activity (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of the growth of actin filaments. Inhibits the activity of the F-actin-capping protein complex formed by the CAPZA1 and CAPZB heterodimer. Promotes growth of cardiomyocytes, but not cardiomyocyte proliferation. Promotes cardiac muscle hypertrophy.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region
