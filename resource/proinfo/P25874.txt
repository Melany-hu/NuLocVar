EntryName	UCP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial brown fat uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) (Solute carrier family 25 member 7) (Thermogenin)
GeneName	UCP1 SLC25A7 UCP
Length	307
Function	Mitochondrial protein responsible for thermogenic respiration, a specialized capacity of brown adipose tissue and beige fat that participates in non-shivering adaptive thermogenesis to temperature and diet variations and more generally to the regulation of energy balance (By similarity). Functions as a long-chain fatty acid/LCFA and proton symporter, simultaneously transporting one LCFA and one proton through the inner mitochondrial membrane (PubMed:24196960, PubMed:28781081). However, LCFAs remaining associated with the transporter via their hydrophobic tails, it results in an apparent transport of protons activated by LCFAs. Thereby, dissipates the mitochondrial proton gradient and converts the energy of substrate oxydation into heat instead of ATP. Regulates the production of reactive oxygen species/ROS by mitochondria (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
