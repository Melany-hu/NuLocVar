UniprotID	Q9BW11
Accession	Q9BW11;B4E0J1;Q53HK1;Q7Z4Y0;Q8NDJ7;Q96ME3
EntryName	MAD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Max dimerization protein 3 (Max dimerizer 3) (Class C basic helix-loop-helix protein 13) (bHLHc13) (Max-associated protein 3) (Max-interacting transcriptional repressor MAD3) (Myx)
GeneName	MXD3 BHLHC13 MAD3
Length	206
Function	Transcriptional repressor. Binds with MAX to form a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein complex which recognizes the core sequence 5'-CACTG-3'. Antagonizes MYC transcriptional activity by competing for MAX and suppresses MYC dependent cell transformation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
