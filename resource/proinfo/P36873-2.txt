UniprotID	P36873-2
Accession	P36873
EntryName	PP1G_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1-gamma catalytic subunit (PP-1G) (EC 3.1.3.16) (Protein phosphatase 1C catalytic subunit)
GeneName	PPP1CC
Length	337
Function	Protein phosphatase that associates with over 200 regulatory proteins to form highly specific holoenzymes which dephosphorylate hundreds of biological targets (PubMed:17936702, PubMed:25012651). Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is essential for cell division, and participates in the regulation of glycogen metabolism, muscle contractility and protein synthesis. Dephosphorylates RPS6KB1 (PubMed:17936702). Involved in regulation of ionic conductances and long-term synaptic plasticity. May play an important role in dephosphorylating substrates such as the postsynaptic density-associated Ca(2+)/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II. Component of the PTW/PP1 phosphatase complex, which plays a role in the control of chromatin structure and cell cycle progression during the transition from mitosis into interphase (PubMed:20516061). In balance with CSNK1D and CSNK1E, determines the circadian period length, through the regulation of the speed and rhythmicity of PER1 and PER2 phosphorylation (PubMed:21712997). May dephosphorylate CSNK1D and CSNK1E (By similarity). Regulates the recruitment of the SKA complex to kinetochores (PubMed:28982702). Dephosphorylates the 'Ser-418' residue of FOXP3 in regulatory T-cells (Treg) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, thereby inactivating FOXP3 and rendering Treg cells functionally defective (PubMed:23396208). Together with PPP1CA (PP1-alpha subunit), dephosphorylates IFIH1/MDA5 and RIG-I leading to their activation and a functional innate immune response (PubMed:23499489). Core component of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1c (SMP) holophosphatase complex that regulates the MAPK pathway activation (PubMed:35768504, PubMed:35831509). The SMP complex specifically dephosphorylates the inhibitory phosphorylation at 'Ser-259' of RAF1 kinase, 'Ser-365' of BRAF kinase and 'Ser-214' of ARAF kinase, stimulating their kinase activities (PubMed:35768504, PubMed:35831509). Dephosphorylates MKI67 at the onset of anaphase (PubMed:25012651). The SMP complex enhances the dephosphorylation activity and substrate specificity of PP1c (PubMed:35768504, PubMed:35831509).
