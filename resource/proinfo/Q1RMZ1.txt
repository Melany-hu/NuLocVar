UniprotID	Q1RMZ1
Accession	Q1RMZ1;Q8N3D0;Q96MV7
EntryName	SAMTR_HUMAN
ProteinName	S-adenosylmethionine sensor upstream of mTORC1 (Probable methyltransferase BMT2 homolog) (EC 2.1.1.-)
GeneName	SAMTOR BMT2 C7orf60
Length	405
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-binding protein that acts as an inhibitor of mTORC1 signaling via interaction with the GATOR1 and KICSTOR complexes (PubMed:29123071, PubMed:35776786). Acts as a sensor of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to signal methionine sufficiency to mTORC1: in presence of methionine, binds S-adenosyl-L-methionine, leading to disrupt interaction with the GATOR1 and KICSTOR complexes and promote mTORC1 signaling (PubMed:29123071, PubMed:35776786). Upon methionine starvation, S-adenosyl-L-methionine levels are reduced, thereby promoting the association with GATOR1 and KICSTOR, leading to inhibit mTORC1 signaling (PubMed:29123071, PubMed:35776786). Probably also acts as a S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase (Potential).
