UniprotID	Q6STE5-2
Accession	Q6STE5;D3DX10;Q2YD86;Q75MJ2;Q75MR8;Q92926;Q9BUH1
EntryName	SMRD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily D member 3 (60 kDa BRG-1/Brm-associated factor subunit C) (BRG1-associated factor 60C) (BAF60C)
GeneName	SMARCD3 BAF60C
Length	470
Function	Involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology). Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Stimulates nuclear receptor mediated transcription. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth (By similarity).
