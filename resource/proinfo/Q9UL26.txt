UniprotID	Q9UL26
Accession	Q9UL26;B3KR86;E1P605;Q8TF12;Q9H4E6
EntryName	RB22A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-22A (Rab-22)
GeneName	RAB22A RAB22
Length	194
Function	Plays a role in endocytosis and intracellular protein transport. Mediates trafficking of TF from early endosomes to recycling endosomes (PubMed:16537905). Required for NGF-mediated endocytosis of NTRK1, and subsequent neurite outgrowth (PubMed:21849477). Binds GTP and GDP and has low GTPase activity. Alternates between a GTP-bound active form and a GDP-bound inactive form (PubMed:16537905).
