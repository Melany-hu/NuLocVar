UniprotID	I3L1E1
Accession	I3L1E1
EntryName	CS084_HUMAN
ProteinName	piRNA-mediated silencing protein C19orf84
GeneName	C19orf84
Length	186
Function	Protein adapter involved in piRNA-directed transposon methylation by connecting PIWIL4-piRNA and DNA methylation machineries. The PIWIL4-piRNA pathway plays a central role during spermatogenesis by directing transposon DNA methylation and silencing, thereby preventing their mobilization, which is essential for the germline integrity.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleoplasm
