UniprotID	O60259
Accession	O60259;Q5V9X1;Q5V9X2;Q8IW69;Q9HCB3;Q9NR68;Q9NR69;Q9UIL9;Q9UQ47
EntryName	KLK8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kallikrein-8 (hK8) (EC 3.4.21.118) (Neuropsin) (NP) (Ovasin) (Serine protease 19) (Serine protease TADG-14) (Tumor-associated differentially expressed gene 14 protein)
GeneName	KLK8 NRPN PRSS19 TADG14 UNQ283/PRO322
Length	260
Function	Serine protease which is capable of degrading a number of proteins such as casein, fibrinogen, kininogen, fibronectin and collagen type IV. Also cleaves L1CAM in response to increased neural activity. Induces neurite outgrowth and fasciculation of cultured hippocampal neurons. Plays a role in the formation and maturation of orphan and small synaptic boutons in the Schaffer-collateral pathway, regulates Schaffer-collateral long-term potentiation in the hippocampus and is required for memory acquisition and synaptic plasticity. Involved in skin desquamation and keratinocyte proliferation. Plays a role in the secondary phase of pathogenesis following spinal cord injury.
