UniprotID	P41143
Accession	P41143;B5B0B8
EntryName	OPRD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Delta-type opioid receptor (D-OR-1) (DOR-1)
GeneName	OPRD1 OPRD
Length	372
Function	G-protein coupled receptor that functions as a receptor for endogenous enkephalins and for a subset of other opioids. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Signaling leads to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. Inhibits neurotransmitter release by reducing calcium ion currents and increasing potassium ion conductance. Plays a role in the perception of pain and in opiate-mediated analgesia. Plays a role in developing analgesic tolerance to morphine.
