EntryName	TGT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase catalytic subunit 1 (EC 2.4.2.64) (Guanine insertion enzyme) (tRNA-guanine transglycosylase)
GeneName	QTRT1 TGT TGUT
Length	403
Function	Catalytic subunit of the queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase (TGT) that catalyzes the base-exchange of a guanine (G) residue with queuine (Q) at position 34 (anticodon wobble position) in tRNAs with GU(N) anticodons (tRNA-Asp, -Asn, -His and -Tyr), resulting in the hypermodified nucleoside queuosine (7-(((4,5-cis-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-yl)amino)methyl)-7-deazaguanosine) (PubMed:11255023, PubMed:20354154, PubMed:34009357, PubMed:34241577). Catalysis occurs through a double-displacement mechanism. The nucleophile active site attacks the C1' of nucleotide 34 to detach the guanine base from the RNA, forming a covalent enzyme-RNA intermediate. The proton acceptor active site deprotonates the incoming queuine, allowing a nucleophilic attack on the C1' of the ribose to form the product (By similarity). Modification of cytoplasmic tRNAs with queuosine controls the elongation speed of cognate codons, thereby ensuring the correct folding of nascent proteins to maintain proteome integrity (PubMed:30093495).
