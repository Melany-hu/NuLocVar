UniprotID	P26842
Accession	P26842;B2RDZ0
EntryName	CD27_HUMAN
ProteinName	CD27 antigen (CD27L receptor) (T-cell activation antigen CD27) (T14) (Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 7) (CD antigen CD27)
GeneName	CD27 TNFRSF7
Length	260
Function	Costimulatory immune-checkpoint receptor expressed at the surface of T-cells, NK-cells and B-cells which binds to and is activated by its ligand CD70/CD27L expressed by B-cells (PubMed:28011863). The CD70-CD27 signaling pathway mediates antigen-specific T-cell activation and expansion which in turn provides immune surveillance of B-cells (PubMed:28011863). Mechanistically, CD70 ligation activates the TRAF2-PTPN6 axis that subsequently inhibits LCK phosphorylation to promote phenotypic and transcriptional adaptations of T-cell memory (PubMed:38354704). In addition, activation by CD70 on early progenitor cells provides a negative feedback signal to leukocyte differentiation during immune activation and thus modulates hematopoiesis (By similarity). Negatively regulates the function of Th2 lymphocytes in the adipose tissue (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
