UniprotID	Q99935
Accession	Q99935;A8MZ07;P85047
EntryName	PROL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Opiorphin prepropeptide (Basic proline-rich lacrimal protein) (Proline-rich protein 1) (PRL1) [Cleaved into: Opiorphin]
GeneName	OPRPN BPLP PROL1
Length	248
Function	Opiorphin is an endogenous inhibitor of neprilysin and aminopeptidase N. Inhibits the breakdown of substance P, Mca-BK2 and Met-enkephalin by neprilysin in vitro with IC(50) values of 29 uM, 33 uM and 33 uM respectively. Inhibits the breakdown of Ala-pNA by aminopeptidase N in vitro with an IC(50) of 65 uM. Has a potent analgesic effect when administered to rats by intravenous injection.
