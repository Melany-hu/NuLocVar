UniprotID	O95393
Accession	O95393;Q53R17;Q6NTE0
EntryName	BMP10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bone morphogenetic protein 10 (BMP-10)
GeneName	BMP10
Length	424
Function	Required for maintaining the proliferative activity of embryonic cardiomyocytes by preventing premature activation of the negative cell cycle regulator CDKN1C/p57KIP and maintaining the required expression levels of cardiogenic factors such as MEF2C and NKX2-5. Acts as a ligand for ACVRL1/ALK1, BMPR1A/ALK3 and BMPR1B/ALK6, leading to activation of SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 transcription factors. Inhibits endothelial cell migration and growth. May reduce cell migration and cell matrix adhesion in breast cancer cell lines.
