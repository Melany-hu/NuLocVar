ProteinName	Kelch-like protein 20 (Kelch-like ECT2-interacting protein) (Kelch-like protein X)

Length	609
Function	Substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex involved in interferon response and anterograde Golgi to endosome transport. The BCR(KLHL20) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex mediates the ubiquitination of DAPK1, leading to its degradation by the proteasome, thereby acting as a negative regulator of apoptosis (PubMed:20389280). The BCR(KLHL20) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex also specifically mediates 'Lys-33'-linked ubiquitination (PubMed:24768539). Involved in anterograde Golgi to endosome transport by mediating 'Lys-33'-linked ubiquitination of CORO7, promoting interaction between CORO7 and EPS15, thereby facilitating actin polymerization and post-Golgi trafficking (PubMed:24768539). Also acts as a regulator of endothelial migration during angiogenesis by controlling the activation of Rho GTPases. The BCR(KLHL20) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex acts as a regulator of neurite outgrowth by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of PDZ-RhoGEF/ARHGEF11 (PubMed:21670212). In case of tumor, the BCR(KLHL20) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex is involved in tumor hypoxia: following hypoxia, the BCR(KLHL20)complex mediates ubiquitination and degradation of PML, potentiating HIF-1 signaling and cancer progression (PubMed:21840486).
