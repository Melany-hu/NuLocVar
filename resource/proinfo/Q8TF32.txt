UniprotID	Q8TF32
Accession	Q8TF32;A8KAK7;Q8IWC4
EntryName	ZN431_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein 431
GeneName	ZNF431 KIAA1969
Length	576
Function	Sequence-specific DNA binding transcriptional repressor. Represses target gene transcription by recruiting HDAC1 and HDAC2 histone deacetylases. Acts as a specific transcriptional repressor for PTCH1 during embryonic development. Required for osteoblast differentiation and sonic hedgehog/SHH signaling response. Binds to the consensus site 5'-GCGCCC-3' in the promoter of PTCH1 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
