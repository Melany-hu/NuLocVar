Accession	Q15084;B3KY95;B5MCQ5;B7Z254;B7Z4M8;F8WA83;Q53RC7;Q6ZSH5;Q99778
EntryName	PDIA6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein disulfide-isomerase A6 (EC 5.3.4.1) (Endoplasmic reticulum protein 5) (ER protein 5) (ERp5) (Protein disulfide isomerase P5) (Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 7)
GeneName	PDIA6 ERP5 P5 TXNDC7
Length	440
Function	May function as a chaperone that inhibits aggregation of misfolded proteins (PubMed:12204115). Negatively regulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) through binding to UPR sensors such as ERN1, which in turn inactivates ERN1 signaling (PubMed:24508390). May also regulate the UPR via the EIF2AK3 UPR sensor (PubMed:24508390). Plays a role in platelet aggregation and activation by agonists such as convulxin, collagen and thrombin (PubMed:15466936).
