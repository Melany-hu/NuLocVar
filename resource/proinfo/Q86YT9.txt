Accession	Q86YT9;B0YIV1;B0YIV2;Q496M1;Q5DTC6;Q7Z499;Q8N9I7;Q8NF70
EntryName	JAML_HUMAN
ProteinName	Junctional adhesion molecule-like (Adhesion molecule interacting with CXADR antigen 1) (Dendritic cell-specific protein CREA7-1)
GeneName	JAML AMICA1 UNQ722/PRO1387
Length	394
Function	Transmembrane protein of the plasma membrane of leukocytes that control their migration and activation through interaction with CXADR, a plasma membrane receptor found on adjacent epithelial and endothelial cells. The interaction between both receptors mediates the activation of gamma-delta T-cells, a subpopulation of T-cells residing in epithelia and involved in tissue homeostasis and repair. Upon epithelial CXADR-binding, JAML induces downstream cell signaling events in gamma-delta T-cells through PI3-kinase and MAP kinases. It results in proliferation and production of cytokines and growth factors by T-cells that in turn stimulate epithelial tissues repair. It also controls the transmigration of leukocytes within epithelial and endothelial tissues through adhesive interactions with epithelial and endothelial CXADR.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell junction
