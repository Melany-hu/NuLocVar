UniprotID	P30531
Accession	P30531;Q8N4K8
EntryName	SC6A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sodium- and chloride-dependent GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1) (Solute carrier family 6 member 1)
GeneName	SLC6A1 GABATR GABT1 GAT1
Length	599
Function	Mediates transport of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) together with sodium and chloride and is responsible for the reuptake of GABA from the synapse (PubMed:30132828). The translocation of GABA, however, may also occur in the reverse direction leading to the release of GABA (By similarity). The direction and magnitude of GABA transport is a consequence of the prevailing thermodynamic conditions, determined by membrane potential and the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of Na(+), Cl(-) and GABA (By similarity). Can also mediate sodium- and chloride-dependent transport of hypotaurine but to a much lower extent as compared to GABA (By similarity).
