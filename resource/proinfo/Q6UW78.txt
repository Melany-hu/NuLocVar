UniprotID	Q6UW78
Accession	Q6UW78;Q5FVD5
EntryName	UQCC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase complex assembly factor 3 (Assembly factor CBP4 homolog)
GeneName	UQCC3 C11orf83 UNQ655/PRO1286
Length	93
Function	Required for the assembly of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex (mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III or cytochrome b-c1 complex), mediating cytochrome b recruitment and probably stabilization within the complex. Thereby, plays an important role in ATP production by mitochondria. Cardiolipin-binding protein, it may also control the cardiolipin composition of mitochondria membranes and their morphology.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
