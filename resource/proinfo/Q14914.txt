EntryName	PTGR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prostaglandin reductase 1 (PRG-1) (15-oxoprostaglandin 13-reductase) (EC 1.3.1.48) (Dithiolethione-inducible gene 1 protein) (D3T-inducible gene 1 protein) (DIG-1) (Leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase) (NAD(P)H-dependent alkenal/one oxidoreductase) (EC 1.3.1.74)
GeneName	PTGR1 LTB4DH
Length	329
Function	NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase involved in metabolic inactivation of pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids: prostaglandins (PG), leukotrienes (LT) and lipoxins (LX) (PubMed:25619643). Catalyzes with high efficiency the reduction of the 13,14 double bond of 15-oxoPGs, including 15-oxo-PGE1, 15-oxo-PGE2, 15-oxo-PGF1-alpha and 15-oxo-PGF2-alpha (PubMed:25619643). Catalyzes with lower efficiency the oxidation of the hydroxyl group at C12 of LTB4 and its derivatives, converting them into biologically less active 12-oxo-LTB4 metabolites (By similarity) (PubMed:25619643). Reduces 15-oxo-LXA4 to 13,14 dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4, enhancing neutrophil recruitment at the inflammatory site (By similarity). May play a role in metabolic detoxification of alkenals and ketones. Reduces alpha,beta-unsaturated alkenals and ketones, particularly those with medium-chain length, showing highest affinity toward (2E)-decenal and (3E)-3-nonen-2-one (PubMed:25619643). May inactivate 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, a cytotoxic lipid constituent of oxidized low-density lipoprotein particles (By similarity).
