UniprotID	Q8N511
Accession	Q8N511
EntryName	TM199_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 199
GeneName	TMEM199 C17orf32
Length	208
Function	Accessory component of the proton-transporting vacuolar (V)-ATPase protein pump involved in intracellular iron homeostasis. In aerobic conditions, required for intracellular iron homeostasis, thus triggering the activity of Fe(2+) prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes, and leading to HIF1A hydroxylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Necessary for endolysosomal acidification and lysosomal degradation (PubMed:28296633). May be involved in Golgi homeostasis (PubMed:26833330). Binds 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol (20(S)-OHC) (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; COPI-coated vesicle membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
