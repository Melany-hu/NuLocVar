EntryName	TNR16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 16 (Gp80-LNGFR) (Low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75NTR) (Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) (NGF receptor) (Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor p75NGFR) (Low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor p75NGR) (p75 ICD) (CD antigen CD271)
GeneName	NGFR TNFRSF16
Length	427
Function	Low affinity receptor which can bind to NGF, BDNF, NTF3, and NTF4. Forms a heterodimeric receptor with SORCS2 that binds the precursor forms of NGF, BDNF and NTF3 with high affinity, and has much lower affinity for mature NGF and BDNF (PubMed:24908487). Plays an important role in differentiation and survival of specific neuronal populations during development (By similarity). Can mediate cell survival as well as cell death of neural cells. Plays a role in the inactivation of RHOA (PubMed:26646181). Plays a role in the regulation of the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface in adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells in response to insulin, probably by regulating RAB31 activity, and thereby contributes to the regulation of insulin-dependent glucose uptake (By similarity). Necessary for the circadian oscillation of the clock genes BMAL1, PER1, PER2 and NR1D1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCmgetaN) of the brain and in liver and of the genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism in the liver (PubMed:23785138). Together with BFAR negatively regulates NF-kappa-B and JNK-related signaling pathways (PubMed:22566094).
