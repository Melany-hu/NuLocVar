UniprotID	P49447
Accession	P49447;B2RE96;B7Z775;D3DU11;Q5BJG9;Q9BU05;Q9BWR9
EntryName	CY561_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane ascorbate-dependent reductase CYB561 (EC 7.2.1.-) (Cytochrome b-561) (Cytochrome b561)
GeneName	CYB561
Length	251
Function	Transmembrane reductase that uses ascorbate as an electron donor in the cytoplasm and transfers electrons across membranes to reduce monodehydro-L-ascorbate radical in the lumen of secretory vesicles. It is therefore involved the regeneration and homeostasis within secretory vesicles of ascorbate which in turn provides reducing equivalents needed to support the activity of intravesicular enzymes.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Chromaffin granule membrane
