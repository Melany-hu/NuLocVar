UniprotID	P06865
Accession	P06865;B4DKE7;E7ENH7;Q53HS8;Q6AI32
EntryName	HEXA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-hexosaminidase subunit alpha (EC 3.2.1.52) (Beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase subunit alpha) (Hexosaminidase subunit A) (N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase subunit alpha)
GeneName	HEXA
Length	529
Function	Hydrolyzes the non-reducing end N-acetyl-D-hexosamine and/or sulfated N-acetyl-D-hexosamine of glycoconjugates, such as the oligosaccharide moieties from proteins and neutral glycolipids, or from certain mucopolysaccharides (PubMed:11707436, PubMed:8123671, PubMed:8672428, PubMed:9694901). The isozyme S is as active as the isozyme A on the anionic bis-sulfated glycans, the chondroitin-6-sulfate trisaccharide (C6S-3), and the dermatan sulfate pentasaccharide, and the sulfated glycosphingolipid SM2 (PubMed:11707436). The isozyme B does not hydrolyze each of these substrates, however hydrolyzes efficiently neutral oligosaccharide (PubMed:11707436). Only the isozyme A is responsible for the degradation of GM2 gangliosides in the presence of GM2A (PubMed:8123671, PubMed:8672428, PubMed:9694901).
