EntryName	SUMF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) (EC 1.8.3.7) (C-alpha-formylglycine-generating enzyme 1) (Sulfatase-modifying factor 1)
GeneName	SUMF1 PSEC0152 UNQ3037/PRO9852
Length	374
Function	Oxidase that catalyzes the conversion of cysteine to 3-oxoalanine on target proteins, using molecular oxygen and an unidentified reducing agent (PubMed:12757706, PubMed:15657036, PubMed:15907468, PubMed:16368756, PubMed:21224894, PubMed:25931126). 3-oxoalanine modification, which is also named formylglycine (fGly), occurs in the maturation of arylsulfatases and some alkaline phosphatases that use the hydrated form of 3-oxoalanine as a catalytic nucleophile (PubMed:12757706, PubMed:15657036, PubMed:15907468, PubMed:16368756, PubMed:25931126). Known substrates include GALNS, ARSA, STS and ARSE (PubMed:12757706, PubMed:15657036, PubMed:15907468).
