UniprotID	O60216
Accession	O60216;A8K0E0;Q15001;Q99568
EntryName	RAD21_HUMAN
ProteinName	Double-strand-break repair protein rad21 homolog (hHR21) (Nuclear matrix protein 1) (NXP-1) (SCC1 homolog) [Cleaved into: 64-kDa C-terminal product (64-kDa carboxy-terminal product) (65-kDa carboxy-terminal product)]
GeneName	RAD21 HR21 KIAA0078 NXP1 SCC1
Length	631
Function	As a member of the cohesin complex, involved in sister chromatid cohesion from the time of DNA replication in S phase to their segregation in mitosis, a function that is essential for proper chromosome segregation, post-replicative DNA repair, and the prevention of inappropriate recombination between repetitive regions (PubMed:11509732). The cohesin complex may also play a role in spindle pole assembly during mitosis (PubMed:11590136). In interphase, cohesins may function in the control of gene expression by binding to numerous sites within the genome (By similarity). May control RUNX1 gene expression (Probable). Binds to and represses APOB gene promoter (PubMed:25575569). May play a role in embryonic gut development, possibly through the regulation of enteric neuron development (By similarity).
