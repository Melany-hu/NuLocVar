UniprotID	Q04900
Accession	Q04900;B4DQ85;E1P5E7;E1P5E8;E1P5E9;O95413;Q5JSU6;Q9BPV0;Q9NR26
EntryName	MUC24_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sialomucin core protein 24 (MUC-24) (Endolyn) (Multi-glycosylated core protein 24) (MGC-24) (MGC-24v) (CD antigen CD164)
GeneName	CD164
Length	197
Function	Sialomucin that may play a key role in hematopoiesis by facilitating the adhesion of CD34(+) cells to the stroma and by negatively regulating CD34(+)CD38(lo/-) cell proliferation. Modulates the migration of umbilical cord blood CD133+ cells and this is mediated through the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. May play an important role in prostate cancer metastasis and the infiltration of bone marrow by cancer cells. Promotes myogenesis by enhancing CXCR4-dependent cell motility. Positively regulates myoblast migration and promotes myoblast fusion into myotubes (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane; Endosome membrane; Cell membrane; Secreted
