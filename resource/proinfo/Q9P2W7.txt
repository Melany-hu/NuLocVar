UniprotID	Q9P2W7
Accession	Q9P2W7;B7Z5Z8;Q96FS7
EntryName	B3GA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Galactosylgalactosylxylosylprotein 3-beta-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (EC 2.4.1.135) (Beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase 1) (Glucuronosyltransferase P) (GlcAT-P) (UDP-GlcUA:glycoprotein beta-1,3-glucuronyltransferase) (GlcUAT-P)
GeneName	B3GAT1 GLCATP
Length	334
Function	Involved in the biosynthesis of L2/HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope on glycoproteins. Can also play a role in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. Substrates include asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR), asialo-fetuin, and asialo-neural cell adhesion molecule. Requires sphingomyelin for activity: stearoyl-sphingomyelin was the most effective, followed by palmitoyl-sphingomyelin and lignoceroyl-sphingomyelin. Activity was demonstrated only for sphingomyelin with a saturated fatty acid and not for that with an unsaturated fatty acid, regardless of the length of the acyl group.
