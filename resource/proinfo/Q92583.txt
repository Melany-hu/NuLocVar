UniprotID	Q92583
Accession	Q92583;A0N0Q9;Q2M287
EntryName	CCL17_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 17 (CC chemokine TARC) (Small-inducible cytokine A17) (Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine)
GeneName	CCL17 SCYA17 TARC
Length	94
Function	Chemokine, which displays chemotactic activity for T lymphocytes, preferentially Th2 cells, but not monocytes or granulocytes. Therefore plays an important role in a wide range of inflammatory and immunological processes (PubMed:8702936, PubMed:9169480). Acts by binding to CCR4 at T-cell surface (PubMed:10540332, PubMed:9169480). Mediates GM-CSF/CSF2-driven pain and inflammation (PubMed:27525438). In the brain, required to maintain the typical, highly branched morphology of hippocampal microglia under homeostatic conditions. May be important for the appropriate adaptation of microglial morphology and synaptic plasticity to acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation (By similarity). Plays a role in wound healing, mainly by inducing fibroblast migration into the wound (By similarity).
