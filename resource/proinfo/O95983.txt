UniprotID	O95983
Accession	O95983;A8K4B7;D6W5Z2;Q6PIL9;Q6PJZ9;Q86XF4
EntryName	MBD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 3 (Methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD3)
GeneName	MBD3
Length	291
Function	Acts as a component of the histone deacetylase NuRD complex which participates in the remodeling of chromatin (PubMed:12124384, PubMed:16428440, PubMed:28977666). Acts as transcriptional repressor and plays a role in gene silencing (PubMed:10947852, PubMed:18644863). Does not bind to methylated DNA by itself (PubMed:12124384, PubMed:16428440). Binds to a lesser degree DNA containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (PubMed:24307175). Recruits histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases.
