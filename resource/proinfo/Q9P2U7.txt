UniprotID	Q9P2U7
Accession	Q9P2U7;B4DFR9;B4DG46;Q6PCD0
EntryName	VGLU1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) (Brain-specific Na(+)-dependent inorganic phosphate cotransporter) (Solute carrier family 17 member 7)
GeneName	SLC17A7 BNPI VGLUT1
Length	560
Function	Multifunctional transporter that transports L-glutamate as well as multiple ions such as chloride, proton, potassium, sodium and phosphate (PubMed:10820226). At the synaptic vesicle membrane, mainly functions as an uniporter which transports preferentially L-glutamate but also phosphate from the cytoplasm into synaptic vesicles at presynaptic nerve terminals of excitatory neural cells (By similarity). The L-glutamate or phosphate uniporter activity is electrogenic and is driven by the proton electrochemical gradient, mainly by the electrical gradient established by the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase across the synaptic vesicle membrane (By similarity). In addition, functions as a chloride channel that allows a chloride permeation through the synaptic vesicle membrane that affects the proton electrochemical gradient and promotes synaptic vesicles acidification (By similarity). Moreover, may function as a K(+)/H(+) antiport allowing to maintain the electrical gradient and to decrease chemical gradient and therefore sustain vesicular glutamate uptake (By similarity). The vesicular K(+)/H(+) antiport activity is electroneutral (By similarity). At the plasma membrane, following exocytosis, functions as a symporter of Na(+) and phosphate from the extracellular space to the cytoplasm allowing synaptic phosphate homeostasis regulation (PubMed:10820226). The symporter activity is driven by an inside negative membrane potential and is electrogenic (By similarity). Is necessary for synaptic signaling of visual-evoked responses from photoreceptors (By similarity).
