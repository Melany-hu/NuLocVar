UniprotID	Q96AP4
Accession	Q96AP4;Q5TD92;Q6PJH7;Q96NV6
EntryName	ZUP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger-containing ubiquitin peptidase 1 (EC 3.4.19.12) (Lys-63-specific deubiquitinase ZUFSP) (DUB) (Zinc finger with UFM1-specific peptidase domain protein)
GeneName	ZUP1 C6orf113 ZUFSP
Length	578
Function	Deubiquitinase with endodeubiquitinase activity that specifically interacts with and cleaves 'Lys-63'-linked long polyubiquitin chains. Shows only weak activity against 'Lys-11' and 'Lys-48'-linked chains (PubMed:29476094, PubMed:29563501, PubMed:29576528). Plays an important role in genome stability pathways, functioning to prevent spontaneous DNA damage and also promote cellular survival in response to exogenous DNA damage (PubMed:29576527, PubMed:29576528). Modulates the ubiquitination status of replication protein A (RPA) complex proteins in response to replication stress (PubMed:29563501).
