EntryName	TRIP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thyroid receptor-interacting protein 6 (TR-interacting protein 6) (TRIP-6) (Opa-interacting protein 1) (OIP-1) (Zyxin-related protein 1) (ZRP-1)
GeneName	TRIP6 OIP1
Length	476
Function	Relays signals from the cell surface to the nucleus to weaken adherens junction and promote actin cytoskeleton reorganization and cell invasiveness. Involved in lysophosphatidic acid-induced cell adhesion and migration. Acts as a transcriptional coactivator for NF-kappa-B and JUN, and mediates the transrepression of these transcription factors induced by glucocorticoid receptor.
