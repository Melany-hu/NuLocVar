UniprotID	Q8N0S6
Accession	Q8N0S6;Q5TEL5;Q96ND4
EntryName	CENPL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Centromere protein L (CENP-L) (Interphase centromere complex protein 33)
GeneName	CENPL C1orf155 ICEN33
Length	344
Function	Component of the CENPA-CAD (nucleosome distal) complex, a complex recruited to centromeres which is involved in assembly of kinetochore proteins, mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. May be involved in incorporation of newly synthesized CENPA into centromeres via its interaction with the CENPA-NAC complex.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome; Centromere
