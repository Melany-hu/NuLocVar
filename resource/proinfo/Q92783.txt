UniprotID	Q92783
Accession	Q92783;B0YJ99;D3DRU5;Q8N6D9
EntryName	STAM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Signal transducing adapter molecule 1 (STAM-1)
GeneName	STAM STAM1
Length	540
Function	Involved in intracellular signal transduction mediated by cytokines and growth factors. Upon IL-2 and GM-CSL stimulation, it plays a role in signaling leading to DNA synthesis and MYC induction. May also play a role in T-cell development. Involved in down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase via multivesicular body (MVBs) when complexed with HGS (ESCRT-0 complex). The ESCRT-0 complex binds ubiquitin and acts as a sorting machinery that recognizes ubiquitinated receptors and transfers them to further sequential lysosomal sorting/trafficking processes.
