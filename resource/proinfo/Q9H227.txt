ProteinName	Cytosolic beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) (Cytosolic beta-glucosidase-like protein 1) (Cytosolic galactosylceramidase) (EC 3.2.1.46) (Cytosolic glucosylceramidase) (EC 3.2.1.45) (Cytosolic glycosylceramidase) (Cytosolic GCase) (Glucosidase beta acid 3) (Glucosylceramidase beta 3) (Klotho-related protein) (KLrP)
GeneName	GBA3 CBG CBGL1
Length	469
Function	Neutral cytosolic beta-glycosidase with a broad substrate specificity that could play a role in the catabolism of glycosylceramides (PubMed:11389701, PubMed:11784319, PubMed:17595169, PubMed:20728381, PubMed:26724485, PubMed:33361282). Has a significant glucosylceramidase activity in vitro (PubMed:17595169, PubMed:26724485). However, that activity is relatively low and its significance in vivo is not clear (PubMed:17595169, PubMed:20728381, PubMed:26724485). Hydrolyzes galactosylceramides/GalCers, glucosylsphingosines/GlcSphs and galactosylsphingosines/GalSphs (PubMed:17595169). However, the in vivo relevance of these activities is unclear (PubMed:17595169). It can also hydrolyze a broad variety of dietary glycosides including phytoestrogens, flavonols, flavones, flavanones and cyanogens in vitro and could therefore play a role in the metabolism of xenobiotics (PubMed:11784319). Possesses transxylosylase activity in vitro using xylosylated ceramides/XylCers (such as beta-D-xylosyl-(1<->1')-N-acylsphing-4-enine) as xylosyl donors and cholesterol as acceptor (PubMed:33361282). Could also play a role in the catabolism of cytosolic sialyl free N-glycans (PubMed:26193330).
