UniprotID	P00505
Accession	P00505;B4DJA6;E7ERW2;Q53FL3;Q9BWA3
EntryName	AATM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aspartate aminotransferase, mitochondrial (mAspAT) (EC 2.6.1.1) (EC 2.6.1.7) (Fatty acid-binding protein) (FABP-1) (Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase 2) (Kynurenine aminotransferase 4) (Kynurenine aminotransferase IV) (Kynurenine--oxoglutarate transaminase 4) (Kynurenine--oxoglutarate transaminase IV) (Plasma membrane-associated fatty acid-binding protein) (FABPpm) (Transaminase A)
GeneName	GOT2 KYAT4
Length	430
Function	Catalyzes the irreversible transamination of the L-tryptophan metabolite L-kynurenine to form kynurenic acid (KA). As a member of the malate-aspartate shuttle, it has a key role in the intracellular NAD(H) redox balance. Is important for metabolite exchange between mitochondria and cytosol, and for amino acid metabolism. Facilitates cellular uptake of long-chain free fatty acids.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix; Cell membrane
