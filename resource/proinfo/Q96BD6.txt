UniprotID	Q96BD6
Accession	Q96BD6;A2A275;Q59FA1;Q5TIH9;Q9BRY9;Q9H6C5
EntryName	SPSB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	SPRY domain-containing SOCS box protein 1 (SSB-1)
GeneName	SPSB1 SSB1
Length	273
Function	Substrate recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin BC-CUL2/5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (PubMed:15601820, PubMed:21199876). Negatively regulates nitric oxide (NO) production and limits cellular toxicity in activated macrophages by mediating the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NOS2 (PubMed:21199876). Acts as a bridge which links NOS2 with the ECS E3 ubiquitin ligase complex components ELOC and CUL5 (PubMed:21199876).
