UniprotID	Q9BQE4
Accession	Q9BQE4;Q3B771;Q9P0I6
EntryName	SELS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Selenoprotein S (SelS) (VCP-interacting membrane protein)
GeneName	SELENOS SELS VIMP AD-015 SBBI8
Length	189
Function	Involved in the degradation process of misfolded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal proteins. Participates in the transfer of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol, where they are destroyed by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. Probably acts by serving as a linker between DERL1, which mediates the retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins into the cytosol, and the ATPase complex VCP, which mediates the translocation and ubiquitination.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Cytoplasm
