UniprotID	Q9BY77
Accession	Q9BY77;A8K6F8;A8K6V9;Q009A7;Q5H972;Q6PGN6;Q7Z6Z0;Q9NSP5;Q9NSP6
EntryName	PDIP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polymerase delta-interacting protein 3 (46 kDa DNA polymerase delta interaction protein) (p46) (S6K1 Aly/REF-like target) (SKAR)
GeneName	POLDIP3 KIAA1649 PDIP46
Length	421
Function	Is involved in regulation of translation. Is preferentially associated with CBC-bound spliced mRNA-protein complexes during the pioneer round of mRNA translation. Contributes to enhanced translational efficiency of spliced over nonspliced mRNAs. Recruits activated ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 I/RPS6KB1 to newly synthesized mRNA. Involved in nuclear mRNA export; probably mediated by association with the TREX complex.
