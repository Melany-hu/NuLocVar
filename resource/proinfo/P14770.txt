UniprotID	P14770
Accession	P14770;Q14445;Q8N1D1;Q92525
EntryName	GPIX_HUMAN
ProteinName	Platelet glycoprotein IX (GP-IX) (GPIX) (Glycoprotein 9) (CD antigen CD42a)
GeneName	GP9
Length	177
Function	The GPIb-V-IX complex functions as the vWF receptor and mediates vWF-dependent platelet adhesion to blood vessels. The adhesion of platelets to injured vascular surfaces in the arterial circulation is a critical initiating event in hemostasis. GP-IX may provide for membrane insertion and orientation of GP-Ib.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
