UniprotID	Q96NX9
Accession	Q96NX9;B1AJV3;B4DQG3;Q8NAY3;Q8ND17;Q96N55
EntryName	DACH2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dachshund homolog 2 (Dach2)
GeneName	DACH2
Length	599
Function	Transcription factor that is involved in regulation of organogenesis. Seems to be a regulator for SIX1 and SIX6. Seems to act as a corepressor of SIX6 in regulating proliferation by directly repressing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, including the p27Kip1 promoter. Is recruited with SIX6 to the p27Kip1 promoter in embryonal retina. SIX6 corepression also seems to involve NCOR1, TBL1, HDAC1 and HDAC3. May be involved together with PAX3, SIX1, and EYA2 in regulation of myogenesis. In the developing somite, expression of DACH2 and PAX3 is regulated by the overlying ectoderm, and DACH2 and PAX3 positively regulate each other's expression (By similarity). Probably binds to DNA via its DACHbox-N domain.
