ProteinName	5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (5-HT-1A) (5-HT1A) (G-21) (Serotonin receptor 1A)
GeneName	HTR1A ADRB2RL1 ADRBRL1
Length	422
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (PubMed:22957663, PubMed:3138543, PubMed:33762731, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37935377, PubMed:8138923, PubMed:8393041). Also functions as a receptor for various drugs and psychoactive substances (PubMed:22957663, PubMed:3138543, PubMed:33762731, PubMed:38552625, PubMed:8138923, PubMed:8393041). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase (PubMed:22957663, PubMed:3138543, PubMed:33762731, PubMed:8138923, PubMed:8393041). HTR1A is coupled to G(i)/G(o) G alpha proteins and mediates inhibitory neurotransmission: signaling inhibits adenylate cyclase activity and activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system that regulates the release of Ca(2+) ions from intracellular stores (PubMed:33762731, PubMed:35610220). Beta-arrestin family members regulate signaling by mediating both receptor desensitization and resensitization processes (PubMed:18476671, PubMed:20363322, PubMed:20945968). Plays a role in the regulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine release and in the regulation of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine metabolism (PubMed:18476671, PubMed:20363322, PubMed:20945968). Plays a role in the regulation of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels in the brain, and thereby affects neural activity, mood and behavior (PubMed:18476671, PubMed:20363322, PubMed:20945968). Plays a role in the response to anxiogenic stimuli (PubMed:18476671, PubMed:20363322, PubMed:20945968).
