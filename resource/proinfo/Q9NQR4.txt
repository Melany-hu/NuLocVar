UniprotID	Q9NQR4
Accession	Q9NQR4;B2R9A3;D3DN47;Q8WUF0
EntryName	NIT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Omega-amidase NIT2 (EC 3.5.1.3) (Nitrilase homolog 2)
GeneName	NIT2 CUA002
Length	276
Function	Has omega-amidase activity (PubMed:19595734, PubMed:22674578). The role of omega-amidase is to remove potentially toxic intermediates by converting 2-oxoglutaramate and 2-oxosuccinamate to biologically useful 2-oxoglutarate and oxaloacetate, respectively (PubMed:19595734).
