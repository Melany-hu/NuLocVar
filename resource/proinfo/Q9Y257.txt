UniprotID	Q9Y257
Accession	Q9Y257;Q9HB47
EntryName	KCNK6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Potassium channel subfamily K member 6 (Inward rectifying potassium channel protein TWIK-2) (TWIK-originated similarity sequence)
GeneName	KCNK6 TOSS TWIK2
Length	313
Function	K(+) channel that conducts outward rectifying currents at the membranes of the endolysosomal system (PubMed:10887187, PubMed:28381826). Active in lysosomes where it regulates lysosome numbers and size (PubMed:28381826). In macrophages, enables K(+) efflux coupled to ATP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation upon bacterial infection. Cooperates with ATP-gated P2RX7 channels to activate NLRP3 inflammasome, with P2RX7 conducting Ca(2+) and Na(+) influx that sets the membrane potential for K(+) efflux (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Late endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane
