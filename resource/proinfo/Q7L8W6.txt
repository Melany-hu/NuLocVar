UniprotID	Q7L8W6
Accession	Q7L8W6;B3KWG1;Q96HJ6
EntryName	DPH6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Diphthine--ammonia ligase (EC 6.3.1.14) (ATP-binding domain-containing protein 4) (Diphthamide synthase) (Diphthamide synthetase) (Protein DPH6 homolog)
GeneName	DPH6 ATPBD4
Length	267
Function	Amidase that may catalyze the last step of diphthamide biosynthesis using ammonium and ATP (PubMed:23169644). Diphthamide biosynthesis consists in the conversion of an L-histidine residue in the translation elongation factor (EEF2) to diphthamide (By similarity).
