EntryName	SHPS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type substrate 1 (SHP substrate 1) (SHPS-1) (Brain Ig-like molecule with tyrosine-based activation motifs) (Bit) (CD172 antigen-like family member A) (Inhibitory receptor SHPS-1) (Macrophage fusion receptor) (MyD-1 antigen) (Signal-regulatory protein alpha-1) (Sirp-alpha-1) (Signal-regulatory protein alpha-2) (Sirp-alpha-2) (Signal-regulatory protein alpha-3) (Sirp-alpha-3) (p84) (CD antigen CD172a)
GeneName	SIRPA BIT MFR MYD1 PTPNS1 SHPS1 SIRP
Length	504
Function	Immunoglobulin-like cell surface receptor for CD47. Acts as docking protein and induces translocation of PTPN6, PTPN11 and other binding partners from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Supports adhesion of cerebellar neurons, neurite outgrowth and glial cell attachment. May play a key role in intracellular signaling during synaptogenesis and in synaptic function (By similarity). Involved in the negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase-coupled cellular responses induced by cell adhesion, growth factors or insulin. Mediates negative regulation of phagocytosis, mast cell activation and dendritic cell activation. CD47 binding prevents maturation of immature dendritic cells and inhibits cytokine production by mature dendritic cells. Plays a role in antiviral immunity and limits new world arenavirus infection by decreasing virus internalization (By similarity). Receptor for THBS1 (PubMed:24511121). Interaction with THBS1 stimulates phosphorylation of SIRPA (By similarity). In response to THBS1, involved in ROS signaling in non-phagocytic cells, stimulating NADPH oxidase-derived ROS production (PubMed:24511121).
