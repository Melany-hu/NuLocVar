EntryName	TSTD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thiosulfate:glutathione sulfurtransferase (TST) (EC 2.8.1.3)
GeneName	TSTD1 KAT
Length	115
Function	Thiosulfate:glutathione sulfurtransferase (TST) required to produce S-sulfanylglutathione (GSS(-)), a central intermediate in hydrogen sulfide metabolism (PubMed:24981631). Provides the link between the first step in mammalian H(2)S metabolism performed by the sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) which catalyzes the conversion of H(2)S to thiosulfate, and the sulfur dioxygenase (SDO) which uses GSS(-) as substrate (PubMed:24981631). The thermodynamic coupling of the irreversible SDO and reversible TST reactions provides a model for the physiologically relevant reaction with thiosulfate as the sulfane donor (PubMed:24981631). GSS(-) spontaneously reacts with glutathione to form glutathione disulfide (Probable).
