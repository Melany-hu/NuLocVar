UniprotID	Q6PKX4
Accession	Q6PKX4;A6NNG3;Q4V9S3;Q8WUZ8;Q96HI2;Q96LU2
EntryName	DOK6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Docking protein 6 (Downstream of tyrosine kinase 6)
GeneName	DOK6 DOK5L
Length	331
Function	DOK proteins are enzymatically inert adaptor or scaffolding proteins. They provide a docking platform for the assembly of multimolecular signaling complexes. DOK6 promotes Ret-mediated neurite growth. May have a role in brain development and/or maintenance.
