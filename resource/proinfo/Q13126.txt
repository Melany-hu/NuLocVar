EntryName	MTAP_HUMAN
ProteinName	S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.28) (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase) (MTA phosphorylase) (MTAP) (MTAPase)
GeneName	MTAP MSAP
Length	283
Function	Catalyzes the reversible phosphorylation of S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine (MTA) to adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate. Involved in the breakdown of MTA, a major by-product of polyamine biosynthesis. Responsible for the first step in the methionine salvage pathway after MTA has been generated from S-adenosylmethionine. Has broad substrate specificity with 6-aminopurine nucleosides as preferred substrates.
