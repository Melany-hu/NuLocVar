UniprotID	Q96I59
Accession	Q96I59;G3V178
EntryName	SYNM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase (AsnRS) (NARS2) (EC 6.1.1.22) (Asparagine--tRNA ligase, mitochondrial)
GeneName	NARS2
Length	477
Function	Mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that catalyzes the specific attachment of the asparagine amino acid (aa) to the homologous transfer RNA (tRNA), further participating in protein synthesis (PubMed:25385316). The reaction occurs in a two steps: asparagine is first activated by ATP to form Asn-AMP and then transferred to the acceptor end of tRNA(Asn) (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix; Mitochondrion
