UniprotID	Q9BVV7
Accession	Q9BVV7;Q9P010
EntryName	TIM21_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit Tim21 (TIM21-like protein, mitochondrial)
GeneName	TIMM21 C18orf55 TIM21 HSPC154
Length	248
Function	Participates in the translocation of transit peptide-containing proteins across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Also required for assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and complex IV as component of the MITRAC (mitochondrial translation regulation assembly intermediate of cytochrome c oxidase complex) complex. Probably shuttles between the presequence translocase and respiratory-chain assembly intermediates in a process that promotes incorporation of early nuclear-encoded subunits into these complexes.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion membrane
