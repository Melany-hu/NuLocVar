UniprotID	Q99877
Accession	Q99877;B2R5L4;Q494S8;Q96FB7
EntryName	H2B1N_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2B type 1-N (Histone H2B.d) (H2B/d)
GeneName	H2BC15 H2BFD HIST1H2BN
Length	126
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
