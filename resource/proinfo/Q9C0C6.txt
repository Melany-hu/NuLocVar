UniprotID	Q9C0C6
Accession	Q9C0C6;B2RCI1;Q8N389;Q8NDZ1
EntryName	CIPC_HUMAN
ProteinName	CLOCK-interacting pacemaker (CLOCK-interacting circadian protein)
GeneName	CIPC KIAA1737
Length	399
Function	Transcriptional repressor which may act as a negative-feedback regulator of CLOCK-BMAL1 transcriptional activity in the circadian-clock mechanism. May stimulate BMAL1-dependent phosphorylation of CLOCK. However, the physiological relevance of these observations is unsure, since experiments in an animal model showed that CIPC is not critially required for basic circadian clock.
