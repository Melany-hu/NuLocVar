UniprotID	O95999
Accession	O95999;Q5VUF1
EntryName	BCL10_HUMAN
ProteinName	B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 10) (Bcl-10) (CARD-containing molecule enhancing NF-kappa-B) (CARD-like apoptotic protein) (hCLAP) (CED-3/ICH-1 prodomain homologous E10-like regulator) (CIPER) (Cellular homolog of vCARMEN) (cCARMEN) (Cellular-E10) (c-E10) (Mammalian CARD-containing adapter molecule E10) (mE10)
GeneName	BCL10 CIPER CLAP
Length	233
Function	Plays a key role in both adaptive and innate immune signaling by bridging CARD domain-containing proteins to immune activation (PubMed:10187770, PubMed:10364242, PubMed:10400625, PubMed:24074955, PubMed:25365219). Acts by channeling adaptive and innate immune signaling downstream of CARD domain-containing proteins CARD9, CARD11 and CARD14 to activate NF-kappa-B and MAP kinase p38 (MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and/or MAPK14) pathways which stimulate expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (PubMed:24074955). Recruited by activated CARD domain-containing proteins: homooligomerized CARD domain-containing proteins form a nucleating helical template that recruits BCL10 via CARD-CARD interaction, thereby promoting polymerization of BCL10, subsequent recruitment of MALT1 and formation of a CBM complex (PubMed:24074955). This leads to activation of NF-kappa-B and MAP kinase p38 (MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and/or MAPK14) pathways which stimulate expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (PubMed:18287044, PubMed:24074955, PubMed:27777308). Activated by CARD9 downstream of C-type lectin receptors; CARD9-mediated signals are essential for antifungal immunity (PubMed:26488816). Activated by CARD11 downstream of T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) (PubMed:18264101, PubMed:18287044, PubMed:24074955, PubMed:27777308). Promotes apoptosis, pro-caspase-9 maturation and activation of NF-kappa-B via NIK and IKK (PubMed:10187815).
