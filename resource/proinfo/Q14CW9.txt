EntryName	AT7L3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ataxin-7-like protein 3 (SAGA-associated factor 11 homolog)
GeneName	ATXN7L3
Length	347
Function	Component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complex SAGA, a multiprotein complex that activates transcription by remodeling chromatin and mediating histone acetylation and deubiquitination. Within the SAGA complex, participates in a subcomplex that specifically deubiquitinates both histones H2A and H2B (PubMed:18206972, PubMed:21746879). The SAGA complex is recruited to specific gene promoters by activators such as MYC, where it is required for transcription. Required for nuclear receptor-mediated transactivation. Within the complex, it is required to recruit USP22 and ENY2 into the SAGA complex (PubMed:18206972). Regulates H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1) levels. Affects subcellular distribution of ENY2, USP22 and ATXN7L3B (PubMed:27601583).
