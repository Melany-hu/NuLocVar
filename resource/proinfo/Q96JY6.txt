UniprotID	Q96JY6
Accession	Q96JY6;D3DSR5;J3KNH4;Q7Z584;Q86WM8;Q8WZ29;Q9H4L9;Q9H7I2
EntryName	PDLI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	PDZ and LIM domain protein 2 (PDZ-LIM protein mystique)
GeneName	PDLIM2 PP6345
Length	352
Function	Probable adapter protein located at the actin cytoskeleton that promotes cell attachment. Necessary for the migratory capacity of epithelial cells. Overexpression enhances cell adhesion to collagen and fibronectin and suppresses anchorage independent growth. May contribute to tumor cell migratory capacity.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Nucleus
