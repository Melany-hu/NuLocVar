EntryName	GLYG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycogenin-1 (GN-1) (GN1) (EC 2.4.1.186)
GeneName	GYG1 GYG
Length	350
Function	Glycogenin participates in the glycogen biosynthetic process along with glycogen synthase and glycogen branching enzyme. It catalyzes the formation of a short alpha (1,4)-glucosyl chain covalently attached via a glucose 1-O-tyrosyl linkage to internal tyrosine residues and these chains act as primers for the elongation reaction catalyzed by glycogen synthase.
