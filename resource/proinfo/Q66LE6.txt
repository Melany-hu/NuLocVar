UniprotID	Q66LE6
Accession	Q66LE6;A8KAK0;Q5SQJ2;Q9P1Y7
EntryName	2ABD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A 55 kDa regulatory subunit B delta isoform (PP2A subunit B isoform B55-delta) (PP2A subunit B isoform PR55-delta) (PP2A subunit B isoform R2-delta) (PP2A subunit B isoform delta)
GeneName	PPP2R2D KIAA1541
Length	453
Function	Substrate-recognition subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that plays a key role in cell cycle by controlling mitosis entry and exit. Involved in chromosome clustering during late mitosis by mediating dephosphorylation of MKI67 (By similarity). The activity of PP2A complexes containing PPP2R2D (PR55-delta) fluctuate during the cell cycle: the activity is high in interphase and low in mitosis (By similarity).
