EntryName	S10A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein S100-A1 (S-100 protein alpha chain) (S-100 protein subunit alpha) (S100 calcium-binding protein A1)
GeneName	S100A1 S100A
Length	94
Function	Small calcium binding protein that plays important roles in several biological processes such as Ca(2+) homeostasis, chondrocyte biology and cardiomyocyte regulation (PubMed:12804600). In response to an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels, binds calcium which triggers conformational changes (PubMed:23351007). These changes allow interactions with specific target proteins and modulate their activity (PubMed:22399290). Regulates a network in cardiomyocytes controlling sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) cycling and mitochondrial function through interaction with the ryanodine receptors RYR1 and RYR2, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase/ATP2A2 and mitochondrial F1-ATPase (PubMed:12804600). Facilitates diastolic Ca(2+) dissociation and myofilament mechanics in order to improve relaxation during diastole (PubMed:11717446).
