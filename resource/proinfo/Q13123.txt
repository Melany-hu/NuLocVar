EntryName	RED_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Red (Cytokine IK) (IK factor) (Protein RER)
GeneName	IK RED RER
Length	557
Function	Involved in pre-mRNA splicing as a component of the spliceosome (PubMed:28781166). Auxiliary spliceosomal protein that regulates selection of alternative splice sites in a small set of target pre-mRNA species (Probable). Required for normal mitotic cell cycle progression (PubMed:22351768, PubMed:24252166). Recruits MAD1L1 and MAD2L1 to kinetochores, and is required to trigger the spindle assembly checkpoint (PubMed:22351768). Required for normal accumulation of SMU1 (PubMed:24945353).
