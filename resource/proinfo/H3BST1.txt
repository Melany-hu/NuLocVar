UniprotID	H3BST1
Accession	H3BST1
EntryName	H3BST1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 subunit 6 (BLOC-1 subunit 6)
GeneName	BLOC1S6
Length	177
Function	Component of the BLOC-1 complex, a complex that is required for normal biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LRO), such as platelet dense granules and melanosomes. In concert with the AP-3 complex, the BLOC-1 complex is required to target membrane protein cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals. The BLOC-1 complex, in association with SNARE proteins, is also proposed to be involved in neurite extension. May play a role in intracellular vesicle trafficking, particularly in the vesicle-docking and fusion process.
