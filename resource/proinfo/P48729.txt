EntryName	KC1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Casein kinase I isoform alpha (CKI-alpha) (EC 2.7.11.1) (CK1)
GeneName	CSNK1A1
Length	337
Function	Casein kinases are operationally defined by their preferential utilization of acidic proteins such as caseins as substrates (PubMed:11955436, PubMed:1409656, PubMed:18305108, PubMed:23902688). It can phosphorylate a large number of proteins (PubMed:11955436, PubMed:1409656, PubMed:18305108, PubMed:23902688). Participates in Wnt signaling (PubMed:11955436). Phosphorylates CTNNB1 at 'Ser-45' (PubMed:11955436). May phosphorylate PER1 and PER2 (By similarity). May play a role in segregating chromosomes during mitosis (PubMed:1409656). May play a role in keratin cytoskeleton disassembly and thereby, it may regulate epithelial cell migration (PubMed:23902688). Acts as a positive regulator of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in response to nutrients by mediating phosphorylation of DEPTOR inhibitor (PubMed:22017875, PubMed:22017877). Acts as an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by mediating phosphorylation of NLRP3 (By similarity).
