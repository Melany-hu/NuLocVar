UniprotID	Q02509
Accession	Q02509;B4DNG8
EntryName	OC90_HUMAN
ProteinName	Otoconin-90 (Oc90) (Phospholipase A2 homolog)
GeneName	OC90 PLA2L
Length	477
Function	Major protein of the otoconia, a calcium carbonate structure in the saccule and utricle of the ear. Together with OTOL1, acts as a scaffold for otoconia biomineralization: sequesters calcium and forms interconnecting fibrils between otoconia that are incorporated into the calcium crystal structure. Together with OTOL1, modulates calcite crystal morphology and growth kinetics. It is unlikely that this protein has phospholipase A2 activity.
