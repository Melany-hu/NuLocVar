UniprotID	P62487
Accession	P62487;B2R5C0;P52433;Q2M1Z4
EntryName	RPB7_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB7 (RNA polymerase II subunit B7) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit G) (RNA polymerase II 19 kDa subunit) (RPB19)
GeneName	POLR2G RPB7
Length	172
Function	Core component of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. POLR2G/RPB7 is part of a subcomplex with POLR2D/RPB4 that binds to a pocket formed by POLR2A/RPB1, POLR2B/RPB2 and POLR2F/RPABC2 at the base of the clamp element. The POLR2D/RPB4-POLR2G/RPB7 subcomplex seems to lock the clamp via POLR2G/RPB7 in the closed conformation thus preventing double-stranded DNA to enter the active site cleft. The POLR2D/RPB4-POLR2G/RPB7 subcomplex binds single-stranded DNA and RNA.
