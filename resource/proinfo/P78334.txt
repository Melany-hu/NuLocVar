EntryName	GBRE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit epsilon (GABA(A) receptor subunit epsilon) (GABAAR subunit epsilon)
GeneName	GABRE
Length	506
Function	Epsilon subunit of the heteropentameric ligand-gated chloride channel gated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain (PubMed:16412217, PubMed:9882711). GABA-gated chloride channels, also named GABA(A) receptors (GABAAR), consist of five subunits arranged around a central pore and contain GABA active binding site(s) located at the alpha and beta subunit interfaces (By similarity). When activated by GABA, GABAARs selectively allow the flow of chloride anions across the cell membrane down their electrochemical gradient (By similarity). GABAARs containing epsilon subunits also permit spontaneous chloride channel activity while preserving the structural information required for GABA-gated openings (PubMed:16412217, PubMed:9882711). GABARs containing epsilon subunit may regulate cardiac function (Probable).
