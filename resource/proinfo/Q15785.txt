UniprotID	Q15785
Accession	Q15785;Q53GH9;Q6IBN7;Q9NTZ3
EntryName	TOM34_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOM34 (hTom34) (Translocase of outer membrane 34 kDa subunit)
GeneName	TOMM34 URCC3
Length	309
Function	Plays a role in the import of cytosolically synthesized preproteins into mitochondria. Binds the mature portion of precursor proteins. Interacts with cellular components, and possesses weak ATPase activity. May be a chaperone-like protein that helps to keep newly synthesized precursors in an unfolded import compatible state.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Mitochondrion outer membrane
