UniprotID	Q9BYR0
Accession	Q9BYR0;A0AVM6;A8MQ08;A8MTL4
EntryName	KRA47_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 4-7 (Keratin-associated protein 4.7) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 4.7)
GeneName	KRTAP4-7 KAP4.7 KRTAP4.7
Length	155
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
