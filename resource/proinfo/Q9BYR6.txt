UniprotID	Q9BYR6
Accession	Q9BYR6;Q52LP0;Q6NTD4
EntryName	KRA33_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 3-3 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 3.3) (Keratin-associated protein 3.3)
GeneName	KRTAP3-3 KAP3.3 KRTAP3.3
Length	98
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
