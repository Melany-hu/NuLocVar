Function	Component of centriolar satellites contributing to primary cilium formation (PubMed:25074808). In complex with CFAP263, acts as a regulator of ciliary beating that connects radial spoke 3 (RS3) to the inner dynein arm (IDA) and the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC). The complex is positioned parallel to N-DRC and forms a connection between the arch at the base of RS3, the IDA tail and N-DRC (By similarity).
