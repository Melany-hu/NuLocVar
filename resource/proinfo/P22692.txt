UniprotID	P22692
Accession	P22692;A0N9W2;B4E351;Q5U012;Q9UCL6
EntryName	IBP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 4 (IBP-4) (IGF-binding protein 4) (IGFBP-4)
GeneName	IGFBP4 IBP4
Length	258
Function	IGF-binding proteins prolong the half-life of the IGFs and have been shown to either inhibit or stimulate the growth promoting effects of the IGFs on cell culture. They alter the interaction of IGFs with their cell surface receptors.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
