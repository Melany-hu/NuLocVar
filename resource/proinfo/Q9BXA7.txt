UniprotID	Q9BXA7
Accession	Q9BXA7;B2R8D9
EntryName	TSSK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (TSK-1) (TSK1) (TSSK-1) (Testis-specific kinase 1) (EC 2.7.11.1) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase 22A)
GeneName	TSSK1B SPOGA1 SPOGA4 STK22A STK22D TSSK1 FKSG81
Length	367
Function	Testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase required during spermatid development. Phosphorylates 'Ser-288' of TSKS. Involved in the late stages of spermatogenesis, during the reconstruction of the cytoplasm. During spermatogenesis, required for the transformation of a ring-shaped structure around the base of the flagellum originating from the chromatoid body.
