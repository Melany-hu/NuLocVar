UniprotID	P35321
Accession	P35321;B1AN47;D3DV31;Q2M303;Q9UDG4
EntryName	SPR1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cornifin-A (19 kDa pancornulin) (SPRK) (Small proline-rich protein IA) (SPR-IA)
GeneName	SPRR1A
Length	89
Function	Cross-linked envelope protein of keratinocytes. It is a keratinocyte protein that first appears in the cell cytosol, but ultimately becomes cross-linked to membrane proteins by transglutaminase. All that results in the formation of an insoluble envelope beneath the plasma membrane.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
