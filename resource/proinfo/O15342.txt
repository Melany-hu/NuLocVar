UniprotID	O15342
Accession	O15342;B2R557;D3DQM1;Q6IBE8
EntryName	VA0E1_HUMAN
ProteinName	V-type proton ATPase subunit e 1 (V-ATPase subunit e 1) (V-ATPase 9.2 kDa membrane accessory protein) (V-ATPase M9.2 subunit) (Vacuolar proton pump subunit e 1)
GeneName	ATP6V0E1 ATP6H ATP6V0E
Length	81
Function	Subunit of the V0 complex of vacuolar(H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase), a multisubunit enzyme composed of a peripheral complex (V1) that hydrolyzes ATP and a membrane integral complex (V0) that translocates protons (PubMed:33065002). V-ATPase is responsible for acidifying and maintaining the pH of intracellular compartments and in some cell types, is targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is responsible for acidifying the extracellular environment (By similarity).
