UniprotID	Q86WS5
Accession	Q86WS5;B9ZVX2
EntryName	TMPSC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protease serine 12 (EC 3.4.21.-)
GeneName	TMPRSS12
Length	348
Function	Required for male fertility (By similarity). Plays a critical role in sperm capacitation and acrosome reactions during fertilization, and also plays a role in the regulation of proteins involved in spermatogenesis (By similarity). Regulates protein pathways that promote chromosomal synapsis formation, double-strand break repair, formation of the inner mitochondrial membrane cristae and apoptosis in developing sperm (By similarity). Required for normal sperm motility and binding to the zona pellucida, potentially via a role in ADAM3 protein maturation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Acrosome
