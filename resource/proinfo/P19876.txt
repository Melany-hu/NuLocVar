UniprotID	P19876
Accession	P19876;Q4W5H9
EntryName	CXCL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-X-C motif chemokine 3 (GRO-gamma(1-73)) (Growth-regulated protein gamma) (GRO-gamma) (Macrophage inflammatory protein 2-beta) (MIP2-beta) [Cleaved into: GRO-gamma(5-73)]
GeneName	CXCL3 GRO3 GROG SCYB3
Length	107
Function	Ligand for CXCR2 (By similarity). Has chemotactic activity for neutrophils. May play a role in inflammation and exert its effects on endothelial cells in an autocrine fashion. In vitro, the processed form GRO-gamma(5-73) shows a fivefold higher chemotactic activity for neutrophilic granulocytes.
