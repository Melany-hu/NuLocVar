UniprotID	Q8N2M4
Accession	Q8N2M4;Q96AJ0
EntryName	TM86A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysoplasmalogenase TMEM86A (EC 3.3.2.2) (Transmembrane protein 86A)
GeneName	TMEM86A
Length	240
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolysis of the vinyl ether bond of choline or ethanolamine lysoplasmalogens, forming fatty aldehyde and glycerophosphocholine or glycerophosphoethanolamine, respectively and is specific for the sn-2-deacylated (lyso) form of plasmalogen (PubMed:36592658). Plays an important role in lysoplasmalogen metabolism in the adipocyte tissue and macrophages (PubMed:36592658).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
