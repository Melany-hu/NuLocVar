UniprotID	O15371
Accession	O15371;A8MWD3;B2R7D4;B4DTF8;B4DVY1;Q3MJD9;Q5M9Q6
EntryName	EIF3D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit D (eIF3d) (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit 7) (eIF-3-zeta) (eIF3 p66)
GeneName	EIF3D EIF3S7
Length	548
Function	mRNA cap-binding component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complex, a complex required for several steps in the initiation of protein synthesis of a specialized repertoire of mRNAs (PubMed:27462815). The eIF-3 complex associates with the 40S ribosome and facilitates the recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A, eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation (PubMed:18599441, PubMed:25849773). The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression (PubMed:25849773). In the eIF-3 complex, EIF3D specifically recognizes and binds the 7-methylguanosine cap of a subset of mRNAs (PubMed:27462815).
