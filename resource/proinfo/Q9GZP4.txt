UniprotID	Q9GZP4
Accession	Q9GZP4;B2R7J4;Q5QPN6;Q5QPN7;Q9NRI8
EntryName	PITH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	PITH domain-containing protein 1
GeneName	PITHD1 C1orf128 AD039 HT014 PP603
Length	211
Function	Promotes megakaryocyte differentiation by up-regulating RUNX1 expression (PubMed:25134913). Regulates RUNX1 expression by activating the proximal promoter of the RUNX1 gene and by enhancing the translation activity of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element in the RUNX1 gene (PubMed:25134913).
