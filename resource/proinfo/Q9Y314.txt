UniprotID	Q9Y314
Accession	Q9Y314;Q96FD2
EntryName	NOSIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nitric oxide synthase-interacting protein (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase NOSIP) (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase NOSIP) (eNOS-interacting protein)
GeneName	NOSIP CGI-25
Length	301
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that is essential for proper development of the forebrain, the eye, and the face. Catalyzes monoubiquitination of serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit PPP2CA/PPP2CB (By similarity). Negatively regulates nitric oxide production by inducing NOS1 and NOS3 translocation to actin cytoskeleton and inhibiting their enzymatic activity (PubMed:11149895, PubMed:15548660, PubMed:16135813).
