EntryName	SMAD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 1 (MAD homolog 1) (Mothers against DPP homolog 1) (JV4-1) (Mad-related protein 1) (SMAD family member 1) (SMAD 1) (Smad1) (hSMAD1) (Transforming growth factor-beta-signaling protein 1) (BSP-1)
GeneName	SMAD1 BSP1 MADH1 MADR1
Length	465
Function	Transcriptional modulator that plays a role in various cellular processes, including embryonic development, cell differentiation, and tissue homeostasis (PubMed:9335504). Upon BMP ligand binding to their receptors at the cell surface, is phosphorylated by activated type I BMP receptors (BMPRIs) and associates with SMAD4 to form a heteromeric complex which translocates into the nucleus acting as transcription factor (PubMed:33667543). In turn, the hetero-trimeric complex recognizes cis-regulatory elements containing Smad Binding Elements (SBEs) to modulate the outcome of the signaling network (PubMed:33667543). SMAD1/OAZ1/PSMB4 complex mediates the degradation of the CREBBP/EP300 repressor SNIP1. Positively regulates BMP4-induced expression of odontogenic development regulator MSX1 following IPO7-mediated nuclear import (By similarity).
