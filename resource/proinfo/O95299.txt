UniprotID	O95299
Accession	O95299;Q8WXC9
EntryName	NDUAA_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 10, mitochondrial (Complex I-42kD) (CI-42kD) (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 42 kDa subunit)
GeneName	NDUFA10
Length	355
Function	Accessory subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Complex I functions in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the respiratory chain. The immediate electron acceptor for the enzyme is believed to be ubiquinone.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
