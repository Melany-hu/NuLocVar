UniprotID	Q06141
Accession	Q06141
EntryName	REG3A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regenerating islet-derived protein 3-alpha (REG-3-alpha) (Hepatointestinal pancreatic protein) (HIP/PAP) (Human proislet peptide) (HIP) (Pancreatitis-associated protein 1) (Regenerating islet-derived protein III-alpha) (Reg III-alpha) [Cleaved into: Regenerating islet-derived protein 3-alpha 16.5 kDa form; Regenerating islet-derived protein 3-alpha 15 kDa form]
GeneName	REG3A HIP PAP PAP1
Length	175
Function	Bactericidal C-type lectin which acts exclusively against Gram-positive bacteria and mediates bacterial killing by binding to surface-exposed carbohydrate moieties of peptidoglycan (PubMed:16931762). Binds membrane phospholipids and kills bacteria by forming a hexameric membrane-permeabilizing oligomeric pore (PubMed:24256734).
Subcellular Location	Secreted
