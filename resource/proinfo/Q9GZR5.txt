UniprotID	Q9GZR5
Accession	Q9GZR5;B2R6B5;Q5TCS2;Q86YJ1;Q9H139
EntryName	ELOV4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Very long chain fatty acid elongase 4 (EC 2.3.1.199) (3-keto acyl-CoA synthase ELOVL4) (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 4) (ELOVL FA elongase 4) (Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4) (Very long chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 4) (Very long chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA synthase 4)
GeneName	ELOVL4
Length	314
Function	Catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction of the four reactions that constitute the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle. This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process allows the addition of 2 carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) per cycle. Condensing enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of very long chain saturated (VLC-SFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators. May play a critical role in early brain and skin development.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
