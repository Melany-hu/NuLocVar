UniprotID	P62316
Accession	P62316;A8K797;J3KPM5;P43330
EntryName	SMD2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein Sm D2 (Sm-D2) (snRNP core protein D2)
GeneName	SNRPD2 SNRPD1
Length	118
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing as a core component of the spliceosomal U1, U2, U4 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:18984161, PubMed:19325628, PubMed:23333303, PubMed:25555158, PubMed:26912367, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:28781166, PubMed:32494006). Component of both the pre-catalytic spliceosome B complex and activated spliceosome C complexes (PubMed:11991638, PubMed:28076346, PubMed:28502770, PubMed:28781166). As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (PubMed:15146077).
