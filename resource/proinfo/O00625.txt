UniprotID	O00625
Accession	O00625;Q5U0G0;Q6FHD2
EntryName	PIR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pirin (EC 1.13.11.24) (Probable quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase PIR) (Probable quercetinase)
GeneName	PIR
Length	290
Function	Transcriptional coregulator of NF-kappa-B which facilitates binding of NF-kappa-B proteins to target kappa-B genes in a redox-state-dependent manner. May be required for efficient terminal myeloid maturation of hematopoietic cells. Has quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase activity (in vitro).
