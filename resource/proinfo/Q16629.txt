UniprotID	Q16629
Accession	Q16629;B4DLU6;G5E9M3;Q564D3
EntryName	SRSF7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 7 (Splicing factor 9G8) (Splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 7)
GeneName	SRSF7 SFRS7
Length	238
Function	Required for pre-mRNA splicing. Can also modulate alternative splicing in vitro. Represses the splicing of MAPT/Tau exon 10. May function as export adapter involved in mRNA nuclear export such as of histone H2A. Binds mRNA which is thought to be transferred to the NXF1-NXT1 heterodimer for export (TAP/NXF1 pathway); enhances NXF1-NXT1 RNA-binding activity. RNA-binding is semi-sequence specific.
