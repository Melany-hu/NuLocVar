UniprotID	Q9C037
Accession	Q9C037;A4D298;Q75MK1;Q96F06;Q9C036
EntryName	TRIM4_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM4 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 87) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase TRIM4) (Tripartite motif-containing protein 4)
GeneName	TRIM4 RNF87
Length	500
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Mediates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of the innate immune receptor RIGI, this linkage doesn't lead to proteasomal degradation but seems to enhance IFN induction.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
