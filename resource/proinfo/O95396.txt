Accession	O95396
EntryName	MOCS3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenylyltransferase and sulfurtransferase MOCS3 (Molybdenum cofactor synthesis protein 3) (Molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase) (MPT synthase sulfurylase) [Includes: Molybdopterin-synthase adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.80) (Adenylyltransferase MOCS3) (Sulfur carrier protein MOCS2A adenylyltransferase); Molybdopterin-synthase sulfurtransferase (EC 2.8.1.11) (Sulfur carrier protein MOCS2A sulfurtransferase) (Sulfurtransferase MOCS3)]
GeneName	MOCS3 UBA4
Length	460
Function	Plays a central role in 2-thiolation of mcm(5)S(2)U at tRNA wobble positions of cytosolic tRNA(Lys), tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln). Also essential during biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor. Acts by mediating the C-terminal thiocarboxylation of sulfur carriers URM1 and MOCS2A. Its N-terminus first activates URM1 and MOCS2A as acyl-adenylates (-COAMP), then the persulfide sulfur on the catalytic cysteine is transferred to URM1 and MOCS2A to form thiocarboxylation (-COSH) of their C-terminus. The reaction probably involves hydrogen sulfide that is generated from the persulfide intermediate and that acts as a nucleophile towards URM1 and MOCS2A. Subsequently, a transient disulfide bond is formed. Does not use thiosulfate as sulfur donor; NFS1 acting as a sulfur donor for thiocarboxylation reactions.
