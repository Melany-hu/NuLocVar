UniprotID	P61366
Accession	P61366;A1A4U3
EntryName	OSTN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Osteocrin (Musclin) [Cleaved into: Processed Osteocrin]
GeneName	OSTN
Length	133
Function	Hormone that acts as a regulator of dendritic growth in the developing cerebral cortex in response to sensory experience (PubMed:27830782). Induced in the brain following membrane depolarization and inhibits dendritic branching in neurons of the developing cortex (PubMed:27830782). Probably acts by binding to natriuretic peptide receptor NPR3/NPR-C, thereby preventing binding between NPR3/NPR-C and natriuretic peptides, leading to increase cGMP production (By similarity).
