UniprotID	P31269
Accession	P31269;O43369;O43429;Q99820
EntryName	HXA9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein Hox-A9 (Homeobox protein Hox-1G)
GeneName	HOXA9 HOX1G
Length	272
Function	Sequence-specific transcription factor which is part of a developmental regulatory system that provides cells with specific positional identities on the anterior-posterior axis. Required for induction of SELE/E-selectin and VCAM1 on the endothelial cells surface at sites of inflammation (PubMed:22269951). Positively regulates EIF4E-mediated mRNA nuclear export and also increases the translation efficiency of ODC mRNA in the cytoplasm by competing with factors which repress EIF4E activity such as PRH (By similarity).
