UniprotID	Q8NCW5
Accession	Q8NCW5;B4DGY3;Q496C6;Q5T3I2
EntryName	NNRE_HUMAN
ProteinName	NAD(P)H-hydrate epimerase (EC 5.1.99.6) (Apolipoprotein A-I-binding protein) (AI-BP) (NAD(P)HX epimerase) (NAXE) (YjeF N-terminal domain-containing protein 1) (YjeF_N1)
GeneName	NAXE AIBP APOA1BP YJEFN1
Length	288
Function	Catalyzes the epimerization of the S- and R-forms of NAD(P)HX, a damaged form of NAD(P)H that is a result of enzymatic or heat-dependent hydration (By similarity) (PubMed:27616477). This is a prerequisite for the S-specific NAD(P)H-hydrate dehydratase to allow the repair of both epimers of NAD(P)HX (By similarity). Accelerates cholesterol efflux from endothelial cells to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and thereby regulates angiogenesis (PubMed:23719382).
