UniprotID	P51808
Accession	P51808;Q6ICS3
EntryName	DYLT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynein light chain Tctex-type 3 (Protein 91/23) (T-complex-associated testis-expressed 1-like)
GeneName	DYNLT3 TCTE1L TCTE1XL
Length	116
Function	Acts as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex that are thought to be involved in linking dynein to cargos and to adapter proteins that regulate dynein function. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. Probably binds BUB3 as part of transport cargo. Required for the efficient progression through mitosis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Chromosome; Centromere; Kinetochore
