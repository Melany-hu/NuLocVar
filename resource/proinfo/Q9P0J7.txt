EntryName	KCMF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase KCMF1 (EC 2.3.2.27) (FGF-induced in gastric cancer) (Potassium channel modulatory factor) (PCMF) (ZZ-type zinc finger-containing protein 1)
GeneName	KCMF1 FIGC ZZZ1
Length	381
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which accepts ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and then transfers it to targeted substrates, promoting their degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:15581609, PubMed:25582440, PubMed:34893540, PubMed:37891180, PubMed:38297121). Together with UBR4, component of the N-end rule pathway: ubiquitinates proteins bearing specific N-terminal residues that are destabilizing according to the N-end rule, leading to their degradation (PubMed:34893540, PubMed:37891180). Does not ubiquitinate proteins that are acetylated at the N-terminus (PubMed:37891180). Together with UBR4, part of a protein quality control pathway that catalyzes ubiquitination and degradation of proteins that have been oxidized in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS): recognizes proteins with an Arg-CysO3(H) degron at the N-terminus, and mediates assembly of heterotypic 'Lys-63'-/'Lys-27'-linked branched ubiquitin chains on oxidized proteins, leading to their degradation by autophagy (PubMed:34893540). Catalytic component of the SIFI complex, a multiprotein complex required to inhibit the mitochondrial stress response after a specific stress event has been resolved: ubiquitinates and degrades (1) components of the HRI-mediated signaling of the integrated stress response, such as DELE1 and EIF2AK1/HRI, as well as (2) unimported mitochondrial precursors (PubMed:38297121). Within the SIFI complex, UBR4 initiates ubiquitin chain that are further elongated or branched by KCMF1 (PubMed:38297121).
