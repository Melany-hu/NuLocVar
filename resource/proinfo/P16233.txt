UniprotID	P16233
Accession	P16233;Q5VSQ2
EntryName	LIPP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase (PL) (PTL) (Pancreatic lipase) (EC 3.1.1.3)
GeneName	PNLIP
Length	465
Function	Plays an important role in fat metabolism. It preferentially splits the esters of long-chain fatty acids at positions 1 and 3, producing mainly 2-monoacylglycerol and free fatty acids, and shows considerably higher activity against insoluble emulsified substrates than against soluble ones.
