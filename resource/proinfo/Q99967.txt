EntryName	CITE2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator 2 (MSG-related protein 1) (MRG-1) (P35srj)
GeneName	CITED2 MRG1
Length	270
Function	Transcriptional coactivator of the p300/CBP-mediated transcription complex. Acts as a bridge, linking TFAP2 transcription factors and the p300/CBP transcriptional coactivator complex in order to stimulate TFAP2-mediated transcriptional activation. Positively regulates TGF-beta signaling through its association with the SMAD/p300/CBP-mediated transcriptional coactivator complex. Stimulates the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors PPARA transcriptional activity. Enhances estrogen-dependent transactivation mediated by estrogen receptors. Also acts as a transcriptional corepressor; interferes with the binding of the transcription factors HIF1A or STAT2 and the p300/CBP transcriptional coactivator complex. Participates in sex determination and early gonad development by stimulating transcription activation of SRY. Plays a role in controlling left-right patterning during embryogenesis; potentiates transcriptional activation of NODAL-mediated gene transcription in the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM). Plays an essential role in differentiation of the adrenal cortex from the adrenogonadal primordium (AGP); stimulates WT1-mediated transcription activation thereby up-regulating the nuclear hormone receptor NR5A1 promoter activity. Associates with chromatin to the PITX2 P1 promoter region.
