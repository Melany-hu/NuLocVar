UniprotID	P78412
Accession	P78412;B2RN06;Q7Z2K0
EntryName	IRX6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Iroquois-class homeodomain protein IRX-6 (Homeodomain protein IRXB3) (Iroquois homeobox protein 6)
GeneName	IRX6 IRX7 IRXB3
Length	446
Function	Transcription factor. Binds to the iroquois binding site (IBS) motif of target genes to regulate gene expression; functions as a transcriptional activator or repressor. Modulates expression of RCVRN, VSX1, BHLHE22/BHLHB5 and TACR3/Nk3r. Required downstream of retinal bipolar cell specification for the terminal differentiation of type 2, type 3a and possibly type 6 bipolar cells.
