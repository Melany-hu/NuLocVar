EntryName	HECA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	HEPACAM family member 2 (Mitotic kinetics regulator)
GeneName	HEPACAM2 MIKI UNQ305/PRO346
Length	462
Function	Required during prometaphase for centrosome maturation. Following poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARsylation) by TNKS, translocates from the Golgi apparatus to mitotic centrosomes and plays a key role in the formation of robust microtubules for prompt movement of chromosomes: anchors AKAP9/CG-NAP, a scaffold protein of the gamma-tubulin ring complex and promotes centrosome maturation.
