UniprotID	P36959
Accession	P36959;Q96HQ6
EntryName	GMPR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	GMP reductase 1 (GMPR 1) (EC 1.7.1.7) (Guanosine 5'-monophosphate oxidoreductase 1) (Guanosine monophosphate reductase 1)
GeneName	GMPR GMPR1
Length	345
Function	Catalyzes the irreversible NADPH-dependent deamination of GMP to IMP. It functions in the conversion of nucleobase, nucleoside and nucleotide derivatives of G to A nucleotides, and in maintaining the intracellular balance of A and G nucleotides.
