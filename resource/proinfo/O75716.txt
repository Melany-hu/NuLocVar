UniprotID	O75716
Accession	O75716;A8K9H9;Q5U0F8;Q96KI2;Q9BUH4;Q9UEN3;Q9UP78
EntryName	STK16_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase 16 (EC 2.7.11.1) (Myristoylated and palmitoylated serine/threonine-protein kinase) (MPSK) (Protein kinase PKL12) (TGF-beta-stimulated factor 1) (TSF-1) (Tyrosine-protein kinase STK16) (EC 2.7.10.2) (hPSK)
GeneName	STK16 MPSK1 PKL12 TSF1
Length	305
Function	Membrane-associated protein kinase that phosphorylates on serine and threonine residues. In vitro substrates include DRG1, ENO1 and EIF4EBP1. Also autophosphorylates. May be involved in secretory vesicle trafficking or intracellular signaling. May have a role in regulating stromal-epithelial interactions that occur during ductal morphogenesis in the mammary gland. May be involved in TGF-beta signaling. Able to autophosphorylate on Tyr residue; it is however unclear whether it has tyrosine-protein kinase toward other proteins.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region; Membrane
