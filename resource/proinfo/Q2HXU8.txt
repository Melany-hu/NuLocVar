UniprotID	Q2HXU8
Accession	Q2HXU8;Q6UWF2;Q6ZRG0
EntryName	CL12B_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-type lectin domain family 12 member B (Macrophage antigen H)
GeneName	CLEC12B UNQ5782/PRO16089
Length	276
Function	Inhibitory receptor postulated to negatively regulate immune and non-immune functions (PubMed:17562706, PubMed:34310951). Upon phosphorylation, recruits SH2 domain-containing PTPN6 and PTPN11 phosphatases to its ITIM motif and antagonizes activation signals (PubMed:17562706, PubMed:34310951). Although it inhibits KLRK1/NKG2D-mediated signaling, it does not bind known ligands of KLRK1/NKG2D and therefore is not its inhibitory counterpart (PubMed:17562706). May limit activation of myeloid cell subsets in response to infection or tissue inflammation (PubMed:17562706). May protect target cells against natural killer cell-mediated lysis (PubMed:17562706). May negatively regulate cell cycle and differentiation of melanocytes via inactivation of STAT3 (PubMed:34310951).
