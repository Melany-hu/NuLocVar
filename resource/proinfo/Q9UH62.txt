UniprotID	Q9UH62
Accession	Q9UH62;Q53HC6;Q7LCF5;Q9NPE4
EntryName	ARMX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Armadillo repeat-containing X-linked protein 3 (ARM protein lost in epithelial cancers on chromosome X 3) (Protein ALEX3)
GeneName	ARMCX3 ALEX3 BM-017 UNQ2517/PRO6007
Length	379
Function	Regulates mitochondrial aggregation and transport in axons in living neurons. May link mitochondria to the TRAK2-kinesin motor complex via its interaction with Miro and TRAK2. Mitochondrial distribution and dynamics is regulated through ARMCX3 protein degradation, which is promoted by PCK and negatively regulated by WNT1. Enhances the SOX10-mediated transactivation of the neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3 and beta-4 subunit gene promoters.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane; Cytoplasm; Nucleus
