UniprotID	Q8IXA5
Accession	Q8IXA5;Q7Z4Y5
EntryName	SACA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sperm acrosome membrane-associated protein 3 (Cancer/testis antigen 54) (CT54) (Lysozyme-like acrosomal sperm-specific secretory protein ALLP-17) (Lysozyme-like protein 3) (Sperm lysozyme-like protein 1) (Sperm protein reactive with antisperm antibodies) (Sperm protein reactive with ASA) [Cleaved into: Sperm acrosome membrane-associated protein 3, membrane form; Sperm acrosome membrane-associated protein 3, processed form]
GeneName	SPACA3 LYC3 LYZL3 SLLP1 SPRASA UNQ424/PRO862
Length	215
Function	Sperm surface membrane protein that may be involved in sperm-egg plasma membrane adhesion and fusion during fertilization. It could be a potential receptor for the egg oligosaccharide residue N-acetylglucosamine, which is present in the extracellular matrix over the egg plasma membrane. The processed form has no detectable bacteriolytic activity in vitro.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Acrosome membrane; Secreted
