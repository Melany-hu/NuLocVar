UniprotID	P10147
Accession	P10147
EntryName	CCL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C motif chemokine 3 (G0/G1 switch regulatory protein 19-1) (Macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha) (MIP-1-alpha) (PAT 464.1) (SIS-beta) (Small-inducible cytokine A3) (Tonsillar lymphocyte LD78 alpha protein) [Cleaved into: MIP-1-alpha(4-69) (LD78-alpha(4-69))]
GeneName	CCL3 G0S19-1 MIP1A SCYA3
Length	92
Function	Monokine with inflammatory and chemokinetic properties. Binds to CCR1, CCR4 and CCR5. One of the major HIV-suppressive factors produced by CD8+ T-cells. Recombinant MIP-1-alpha induces a dose-dependent inhibition of different strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).
