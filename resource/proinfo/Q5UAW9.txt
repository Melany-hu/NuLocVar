UniprotID	Q5UAW9
Accession	Q5UAW9;A2A334;Q8WWB8;Q9HA73
EntryName	GP157_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 157
GeneName	GPR157
Length	335
Function	Orphan receptor that promotes neuronal differentiation of radial glial progenitors (RGPs). The activity of this receptor is mediated by a G(q)-protein that activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger.
Subcellular Location	Cell projection; Cilium membrane
