EntryName	ALDOB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B (EC 4.1.2.13) (Liver-type aldolase)
GeneName	ALDOB ALDB
Length	364
Function	Catalyzes the aldol cleavage of fructose 1,6-biphosphate to form two triosephosphates dihydroxyacetone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in glycolysis as well as the reverse stereospecific aldol addition reaction in gluconeogenesis. In fructolysis, metabolizes fructose 1-phosphate derived from the phosphorylation of dietary fructose by fructokinase into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde (PubMed:10970798, PubMed:12205126, PubMed:20848650). Acts as an adapter independently of its enzymatic activity, exerts a tumor suppressor role by stabilizing the ternary complex with G6PD and TP53 to inhibit G6PD activity and keep oxidative pentose phosphate metabolism in check (PubMed:35122041).
