UniprotID	Q969J5
Accession	Q969J5;Q08AH7;Q6UWM1;Q96A41;Q96QR0
EntryName	I22R2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-22 receptor subunit alpha-2 (IL-22 receptor subunit alpha-2) (IL-22R-alpha-2) (IL-22RA2) (Cytokine receptor class-II member 10) (Cytokine receptor family 2 member 10) (CRF2-10) (Cytokine receptor family type 2, soluble 1) (CRF2-S1) (Interleukin-22-binding protein) (IL-22BP) (IL22BP) (ZcytoR16)
GeneName	IL22RA2 UNQ5793/PRO19598/PRO19822
Length	263
Function	Isoform 2 is a receptor for IL22. Binds to IL22, prevents interaction with the functional IL-22R complex and blocks the activity of IL22 (in vitro). May play an important role as an IL22 antagonist in the regulation of inflammatory responses.
