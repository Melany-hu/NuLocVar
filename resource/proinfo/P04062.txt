Function	Glucosylceramidase that catalyzes, within the lysosomal compartment, the hydrolysis of glucosylceramides/GlcCers (such as beta-D-glucosyl-(1<->1')-N-acylsphing-4-enine) into free ceramides (such as N-acylsphing-4-enine) and glucose (PubMed:15916907, PubMed:24211208, PubMed:32144204, PubMed:9201993). Plays a central role in the degradation of complex lipids and the turnover of cellular membranes (PubMed:27378698). Through the production of ceramides, participates in the PKC-activated salvage pathway of ceramide formation (PubMed:19279011). Catalyzes the glucosylation of cholesterol, through a transglucosylation reaction where glucose is transferred from GlcCer to cholesterol (PubMed:24211208, PubMed:26724485, PubMed:32144204). GlcCer containing mono-unsaturated fatty acids (such as beta-D-glucosyl-N-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-sphing-4-enine) are preferred as glucose donors for cholesterol glucosylation when compared with GlcCer containing same chain length of saturated fatty acids (such as beta-D-glucosyl-N-octadecanoyl-sphing-4-enine) (PubMed:24211208). Under specific conditions, may alternatively catalyze the reverse reaction, transferring glucose from cholesteryl 3-beta-D-glucoside to ceramide (Probable) (PubMed:26724485). Can also hydrolyze cholesteryl 3-beta-D-glucoside producing glucose and cholesterol (PubMed:24211208, PubMed:26724485). Catalyzes the hydrolysis of galactosylceramides/GalCers (such as beta-D-galactosyl-(1<->1')-N-acylsphing-4-enine), as well as the transfer of galactose between GalCers and cholesterol in vitro, but with lower activity than with GlcCers (PubMed:32144204). Contrary to GlcCer and GalCer, xylosylceramide/XylCer (such as beta-D-xyosyl-(1<->1')-N-acylsphing-4-enine) is not a good substrate for hydrolysis, however it is a good xylose donor for transxylosylation activity to form cholesteryl 3-beta-D-xyloside (PubMed:33361282).
