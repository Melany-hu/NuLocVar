UniprotID	Q969X0
Accession	Q969X0
EntryName	RIPL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	RILP-like protein 2 (Rab-interacting lysosomal protein-like 2) (p40phox-binding protein)
GeneName	RILPL2 RLP2
Length	211
Function	Involved in cell shape and neuronal morphogenesis, positively regulating the establishment and maintenance of dendritic spines (By similarity). Plays a role in cellular protein transport, including protein transport away from primary cilia (By similarity). May function via activation of RAC1 and PAK1 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome; Cell projection; Cilium
