UniprotID	P51553
Accession	P51553;E9PDD5;Q9BUU5
EntryName	IDH3G_HUMAN
ProteinName	Isocitrate dehydrogenase [NAD] subunit gamma, mitochondrial (Isocitric dehydrogenase subunit gamma) (NAD(+)-specific ICDH subunit gamma)
GeneName	IDH3G
Length	393
Function	Regulatory subunit which plays a role in the allosteric regulation of the enzyme catalyzing the decarboxylation of isocitrate (ICT) into alpha-ketoglutarate. The heterodimer composed of the alpha (IDH3A) and beta (IDH3B) subunits and the heterodimer composed of the alpha (IDH3A) and gamma (IDH3G) subunits, have considerable basal activity but the full activity of the heterotetramer (containing two subunits of IDH3A, one of IDH3B and one of IDH3G) requires the assembly and cooperative function of both heterodimers.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
