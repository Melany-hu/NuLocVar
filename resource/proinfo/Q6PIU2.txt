EntryName	NCEH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH) (EC 3.1.1.-) (Acetylalkylglycerol acetylhydrolase) (2-acetyl MAGE hydrolase) (EC 3.1.1.71) (Arylacetamide deacetylase-like 1)
GeneName	NCEH1 AADACL1 KIAA1363
Length	408
Function	Hydrolyzes 2-acetyl monoalkylglycerol ether (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol), the penultimate precursor of the pathway for de novo synthesis of platelet-activating factor (PubMed:17052608). May be responsible for the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters (such as cholesteryl (9Z-octadecenoate)) in macrophages (By similarity). Also involved in organ detoxification by hydrolyzing exogenous organophosphorus compounds (By similarity). May contribute to cancer pathogenesis by promoting tumor cell migration (PubMed:17052608).
