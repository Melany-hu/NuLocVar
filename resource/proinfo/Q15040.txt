UniprotID	Q15040
Accession	Q15040;A8K712
EntryName	JOS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Josephin-1 (EC 3.4.19.12) (Josephin domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	JOSD1 JSPH1 KIAA0063
Length	202
Function	Deubiquitinates monoubiquitinated probes (in vitro). When ubiquitinated, cleaves 'Lys-63'-linked and 'Lys-48'-linked poly-ubiquitin chains (in vitro), hence may act as a deubiquitinating enzyme. May increase macropinocytosis and suppress clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. May enhance membrane dynamics and cell motility independently of its catalytic activity.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasm
