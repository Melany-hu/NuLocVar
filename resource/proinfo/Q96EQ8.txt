UniprotID	Q96EQ8
Accession	Q96EQ8;Q9NX39
EntryName	RN125_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF125 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 125) (T-cell RING activation protein 1) (TRAC-1)
GeneName	RNF125
Length	232
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, such as RIGI, MAVS/IPS1, IFIH1/MDA5, JAK1 and p53/TP53 (PubMed:15843525, PubMed:17460044, PubMed:17643463, PubMed:25591766, PubMed:26027934, PubMed:26471729, PubMed:27411375). Acts as a negative regulator of type I interferon production by mediating ubiquitination of RIGI at 'Lys-181', leading to RIGI degradation (PubMed:17460044, PubMed:26471729). Mediates ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53/TP53 (PubMed:25591766). Mediates ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of JAK1 (PubMed:26027934). Acts as a positive regulator of T-cell activation (PubMed:15843525).
