UniprotID	Q9NWH2
Accession	Q9NWH2;B9EJD0;Q9NZ88;Q9P094
EntryName	TM242_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 242
GeneName	TMEM242 C6orf35 BM-033 HSPC287
Length	141
Function	Scaffold protein that participates in the c-ring assembly of mitochondrial ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or complex V) by facilitating the membrane insertion and oligomer formation of the subunit c/ATP5MC3 (PubMed:33753518). Participates in the incorporation of the c-ring into vestigial complexes (PubMed:33753518). Additionally influences the incorporation of subunits MT-ATP6, MT-ATP8, ATP5MJ, and ATP5MK in the ATP synthase (PubMed:33753518).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
