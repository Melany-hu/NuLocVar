UniprotID	Q13112
Accession	Q13112;Q99548
EntryName	CAF1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit B (CAF-1 subunit B) (Chromatin assembly factor I p60 subunit) (CAF-I 60 kDa subunit) (CAF-I p60) (M-phase phosphoprotein 7)
GeneName	CHAF1B CAF1A CAF1P60 MPHOSPH7 MPP7
Length	559
Function	Acts as a component of the histone chaperone complex chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1), which assembles histone octamers onto DNA during replication and repair. CAF-1 performs the first step of the nucleosome assembly process, bringing newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 to replicating DNA; histones H2A/H2B can bind to this chromatin precursor subsequent to DNA replication to complete the histone octamer.
