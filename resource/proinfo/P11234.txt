UniprotID	P11234
Accession	P11234;B4E040;Q53T32;Q6ZS74
EntryName	RALB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Ral-B (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RALB
Length	206
Function	Multifunctional GTPase involved in a variety of cellular processes including gene expression, cell migration, cell proliferation, oncogenic transformation and membrane trafficking (PubMed:10393179, PubMed:17875936, PubMed:18756269). Accomplishes its multiple functions by interacting with distinct downstream effectors. Acts as a GTP sensor for GTP-dependent exocytosis of dense core vesicles (By similarity). Required both to stabilize the assembly of the exocyst complex and to localize functional exocyst complexes to the leading edge of migrating cells (By similarity). Required for suppression of apoptosis (PubMed:17875936). In late stages of cytokinesis, upon completion of the bridge formation between dividing cells, mediates exocyst recruitment to the midbody to drive abscission (PubMed:18756269). Involved in ligand-dependent receptor mediated endocytosis of the EGF and insulin receptors (PubMed:10393179).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Midbody
