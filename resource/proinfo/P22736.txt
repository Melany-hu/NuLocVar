UniprotID	P22736
Accession	P22736;B4DML7;Q15627;Q53Y00;Q6IBU8
EntryName	NR4A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear receptor subfamily 4immunitygroup A member 1 (Early response protein NAK1) (Nuclear hormone receptor NUR/77) (Nur77) (Orphan nuclear receptor HMR) (Orphan nuclear receptor TR3) (ST-59) (Testicular receptor 3)
GeneName	NR4A1 GFRP1 HMR NAK1
Length	598
Function	Orphan nuclear receptor. Binds the NGFI-B response element (NBRE) 5'-AAAGGTCA-3' (PubMed:18690216, PubMed:8121493, PubMed:9315652). Binds 9-cis-retinoic acid outside of its ligand-binding (NR LBD) domain (PubMed:18690216). Participates in energy homeostasis by sequestrating the kinase STK11 in the nucleus, thereby attenuating cytoplasmic AMPK activation (PubMed:22983157). Regulates the inflammatory response in macrophages by regulating metabolic adaptations during inflammation, including repressing the transcription of genes involved in the citric acid cycle (TCA) (By similarity). Inhibits NF-kappa-B signaling by binding to low-affinity NF-kappa-B binding sites, such as at the IL2 promoter (PubMed:15466594). May act concomitantly with NR4A2 in regulating the expression of delayed-early genes during liver regeneration (By similarity). Plays a role in the vascular response to injury (By similarity).
