EntryName	MBOA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysophospholipid acyltransferase 1 (LPLAT 1) (1-acylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.23) (1-acylglycerophosphoethanolamine O-acyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.n7) (1-acylglycerophosphoserine O-acyltransferase MBOAT1) (EC 2.3.1.n6) (Lysophosphatidylserine acyltransferase) (LPSAT) (Lyso-PS acyltransferase) (Membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing protein 1) (O-acyltransferase domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	MBOAT1 OACT1
Length	495
Function	Acyltransferase which catalyzes the transfer of an acyl group from an acyl-CoA towards a lysophospholipid producing a phospholipid and participates in the reacylation step of the phospholipid remodeling pathway also known as the Lands cycle (PubMed:18772128). Acts on lysophosphatidylserine (1-acyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine or LPS) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or LPE), and to a lesser extend lysophosphatidylcholine (PubMed:18772128). Prefers oleoyl-CoA as the acyl donor and 1-oleoyl-LPE as acceptor (PubMed:18772128). May play a role in neurite outgrowth during neuronal differentiation (By similarity).
