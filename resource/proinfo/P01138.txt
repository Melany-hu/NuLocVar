Function	Nerve growth factor is important for the development and maintenance of the sympathetic and sensory nervous systems (PubMed:14976160, PubMed:20978020). Extracellular ligand for the NTRK1 and NGFR receptors, activates cellular signaling cascades to regulate neuronal proliferation, differentiation and survival (Probable) (PubMed:20978020). The immature NGF precursor (proNGF) functions as a ligand for the heterodimeric receptor formed by SORCS2 and NGFR, and activates cellular signaling cascades that lead to inactivation of RAC1 and/or RAC2, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and neuronal growth cone collapse. In contrast to mature NGF, the precursor form (proNGF) promotes neuronal apoptosis (in vitro) (By similarity). Inhibits metalloproteinase-dependent proteolysis of platelet glycoprotein VI (PubMed:20164177). Binds lysophosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylserine between the two chains of the homodimer. The lipid-bound form promotes histamine relase from mast cells, contrary to the lipid-free form (By similarity).
