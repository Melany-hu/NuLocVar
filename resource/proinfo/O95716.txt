UniprotID	O95716
Accession	O95716
EntryName	RAB3D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-3D (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB3D GOV RAB16
Length	219
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (By similarity). RAB3D may be involved in the insulin-induced exocytosis of GLUT4-containing vesicles in adipocytes (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
