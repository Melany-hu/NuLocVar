Accession	Q9BQQ3;B3KWC8;Q3SYG7;Q8N272;Q96H42
EntryName	GORS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Golgi reassembly-stacking protein 1 (Golgi peripheral membrane protein p65) (Golgi phosphoprotein 5) (GOLPH5) (Golgi reassembly-stacking protein of 65 kDa) (GRASP65)
GeneName	GORASP1 GOLPH5 GRASP65
Length	215
Function	Key structural protein of the Golgi apparatus (PubMed:33301566). The membrane cisternae of the Golgi apparatus adhere to each other to form stacks, which are aligned side by side to form the Golgi ribbon (PubMed:33301566). Acting in concert with GORASP2/GRASP55, is required for the formation and maintenance of the Golgi ribbon, and may be dispensable for the formation of stacks (PubMed:33301566). However, other studies suggest that GORASP1 plays an important role in assembly and membrane stacking of the cisternae, and in the reassembly of Golgi stacks after breakdown during mitosis (By similarity). Caspase-mediated cleavage of GORASP1 is required for fragmentation of the Golgi during apoptosis (By similarity). Also mediates, via its interaction with GOLGA2/GM130, the docking of transport vesicles with the Golgi membranes (PubMed:16489344). Mediates ER stress-induced unconventional (ER/Golgi-independent) trafficking of core-glycosylated CFTR to cell membrane (PubMed:21884936).
