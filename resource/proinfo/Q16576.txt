UniprotID	Q16576
Accession	Q16576;Q5JP00
EntryName	RBBP7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone-binding protein RBBP7 (Histone acetyltransferase type B subunit 2) (Nucleosome-remodeling factor subunit RBAP46) (Retinoblastoma-binding protein 7) (RBBP-7) (Retinoblastoma-binding protein p46)
GeneName	RBBP7 RBAP46
Length	425
Function	Core histone-binding subunit that may target chromatin remodeling factors, histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases to their histone substrates in a manner that is regulated by nucleosomal DNA. Component of several complexes which regulate chromatin metabolism. These include the type B histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex, which is required for chromatin assembly following DNA replication; the core histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex, which promotes histone deacetylation and consequent transcriptional repression; the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex (the NuRD complex), which promotes transcriptional repression by histone deacetylation and nucleosome remodeling; and the PRC2/EED-EZH2 complex, which promotes repression of homeotic genes during development; and the NURF (nucleosome remodeling factor) complex.
