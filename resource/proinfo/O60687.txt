UniprotID	O60687
Accession	O60687;B3KQT3;Q8WW85
EntryName	SRPX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sushi repeat-containing protein SRPX2 (Sushi-repeat protein upregulated in leukemia)
GeneName	SRPX2 SRPUL
Length	465
Function	Acts as a ligand for the urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor. Plays a role in angiogenesis by inducing endothelial cell migration and the formation of vascular network (cords). Involved in cellular migration and adhesion. Increases the phosphorylation levels of FAK. Interacts with and increases the mitogenic activity of HGF. Promotes synapse formation. May have a role in the perisylvian region, critical for language and cognitive development.
