UniprotID	Q15173
Accession	Q15173;Q13853
EntryName	2A5B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A 56 kDa regulatory subunit beta isoform (PP2A B subunit isoform B'-beta) (PP2A B subunit isoform B56-beta) (PP2A B subunit isoform PR61-beta) (PP2A B subunit isoform R5-beta)
GeneName	PPP2R5B
Length	497
Function	As the regulatory component of the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme, modulates substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and responsiveness to phosphorylation. The phosphorylated form mediates the interaction between PP2A and AKT1, leading to AKT1 dephosphorylation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
