UniprotID	P43080
Accession	P43080;B3KWT4;Q7Z6T1;Q9NU14
EntryName	GUC1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanylyl cyclase-activating protein 1 (GCAP 1) (Guanylate cyclase activator 1A)
GeneName	GUCA1A C6orf131 GCAP GCAP1 GUCA1
Length	201
Function	Stimulates retinal guanylyl cyclase when free calcium ions concentration is low and inhibits guanylyl cyclase when free calcium ions concentration is elevated (PubMed:18706439, PubMed:19459154, PubMed:30184081, PubMed:30622141). This Ca(2+)-sensitive regulation of retinal guanylyl cyclase is a key event in recovery of the dark state of rod photoreceptors following light exposure (By similarity). May be involved in cone photoreceptor light response and recovery of response in bright light (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Photoreceptor inner segment; Cell projection; Cilium; Photoreceptor outer segment
