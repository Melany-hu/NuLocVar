UniprotID	A8K0Z3
Accession	A8K0Z3
EntryName	WASH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	WASH complex subunit 1 (CXYorf1-like protein on chromosome 9) (Protein FAM39E) (WAS protein family homolog 1)
GeneName	WASHC1 FAM39E WASH1
Length	465
Function	Acts as a component of the WASH core complex that functions as a nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) at the surface of endosomes, where it recruits and activates the Arp2/3 complex to induce actin polymerization, playing a key role in the fission of tubules that serve as transport intermediates during endosome sorting (PubMed:19922874, PubMed:19922875, PubMed:20498093, PubMed:23452853). Involved in endocytic trafficking of EGF (By similarity). Involved in transferrin receptor recycling. Regulates the trafficking of endosomal alpha5beta1 integrin to the plasma membrane and involved in invasive cell migration (PubMed:22114305). In T-cells involved in endosome-to-membrane recycling of receptors including T-cell receptor (TCR), CD28 and ITGAL; proposed to be implicated in T cell proliferation and effector function. In dendritic cells involved in endosome-to-membrane recycling of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II probably involving retromer and subsequently allowing antigen sampling, loading and presentation during T-cell activation (By similarity). Involved in Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin assembly driving Salmonella typhimurium invasion independent of ruffling. Involved in the exocytosis of MMP14 leading to matrix remodeling during invasive migration and implicating late endosome-to-plasma membrane tubular connections and cooperation with the exocyst complex (PubMed:24344185). Involved in negative regulation of autophagy independently from its role in endosomal sorting by inhibiting BECN1 ubiquitination to inactivate PIK3C3/Vps34 activity (By similarity).
