UniprotID	Q8N0U8
Accession	Q8N0U8;B4E222;E7ETM5;Q6AHW9;Q6TEK6
EntryName	VKORL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1-like protein 1 (VKORC1-like protein 1) (EC 1.17.4.4)
GeneName	VKORC1L1
Length	176
Function	Involved in vitamin K metabolism. Can reduce inactive vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to active vitamin K, and may contribute to vitamin K-mediated protection against oxidative stress. Plays a role in vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation of Glu residues in target proteins.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
