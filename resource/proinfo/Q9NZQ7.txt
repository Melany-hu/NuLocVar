EntryName	PD1L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) (PDCD1 ligand 1) (Programmed death ligand 1) (hPD-L1) (B7 homolog 1) (B7-H1) (CD antigen CD274)
GeneName	CD274 B7H1 PDCD1L1 PDCD1LG1 PDL1
Length	290
Function	Plays a critical role in induction and maintenance of immune tolerance to self (PubMed:11015443, PubMed:28813410, PubMed:28813417, PubMed:31399419). As a ligand for the inhibitory receptor PDCD1/PD-1, modulates the activation threshold of T-cells and limits T-cell effector response (PubMed:11015443, PubMed:28813410, PubMed:28813417, PubMed:36727298). Through a yet unknown activating receptor, may costimulate T-cell subsets that predominantly produce interleukin-10 (IL10) (PubMed:10581077). Can also act as a transcription coactivator: in response to hypoxia, translocates into the nucleus via its interaction with phosphorylated STAT3 and promotes transcription of GSDMC, leading to pyroptosis (PubMed:32929201).
