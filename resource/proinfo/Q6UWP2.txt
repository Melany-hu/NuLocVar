UniprotID	Q6UWP2
Accession	Q6UWP2;A0A0U5BLD0;B2RDZ3;Q9BUC7;Q9H674
EntryName	DHR11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 11 (17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) (3-beta-hydroxysteroid 3-dehydrogenase) (EC 1.1.1.270) (Estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase) (EC 1.1.1.62) (Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 24C member 1)
GeneName	DHRS11 SDR24C1 UNQ836/PRO1774
Length	260
Function	Catalyzes the conversion of the 17-keto group of estrone, 4- and 5-androstenes and 5-alpha-androstanes into their 17-beta-hydroxyl metabolites and the conversion of the 3-keto group of 3-, 3,17- and 3,20- diketosteroids into their 3-hydroxyl metabolites. Exhibits reductive 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity toward 5-beta-androstanes, 5-beta-pregnanes, 4-pregnenes and bile acids. May also reduce endogenous and exogenous alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and xenobiotic alicyclic ketones.
Subcellular Location	Secreted
