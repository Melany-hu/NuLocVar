UniprotID	Q9NPB1
Accession	Q9NPB1
EntryName	NT5M_HUMAN
ProteinName	5'(3')-deoxyribonucleotidase, mitochondrial (5',3'-nucleotidase, mitochondrial) (EC 3.1.3.-) (Deoxy-5'-nucleotidase 2) (dNT-2)
GeneName	NT5M DNT2
Length	228
Function	Dephosphorylates specifically the 5' and 2'(3')-phosphates of uracil and thymine deoxyribonucleotides, and so protects mitochondrial DNA replication from excess dTTP. Has only marginal activity towards dIMP and dGMP.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
