UniprotID	Q8NHG8
Accession	Q8NHG8
EntryName	ZNRF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ZNRF2 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Protein Ells2) (RING finger protein 202) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase ZNRF2) (Zinc/RING finger protein 2)
GeneName	ZNRF2 RNF202
Length	242
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of neuronal transmission and plasticity. Ubiquitinates the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase alpha-1 subunit/ATP1A1 and thereby influences its endocytosis and/or degradation (PubMed:22797923). Acts also as a positive regulator of mTORC1 activation by amino acids, which functions upstream of the V-ATPase and of Rag-GTPases (PubMed:27244671). In turn, phosphorylation by mTOR leads to its inhibition via targeting to the cytosol allowing a self-regulating feedback mechanism (PubMed:27244671).
Subcellular Location	Endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane; Presynaptic cell membrane; Cytoplasm
