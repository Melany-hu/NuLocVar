EntryName	PCH2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pachytene checkpoint protein 2 homolog (Human papillomavirus type 16 E1 protein-binding protein) (16E1-BP) (HPV16 E1 protein-binding protein) (Thyroid hormone receptor interactor 13) (Thyroid receptor-interacting protein 13) (TR-interacting protein 13) (TRIP-13)
GeneName	TRIP13 PCH2
Length	432
Function	Plays a key role in chromosome recombination and chromosome structure development during meiosis. Required at early steps in meiotic recombination that leads to non-crossovers pathways. Also needed for efficient completion of homologous synapsis by influencing crossover distribution along the chromosomes affecting both crossovers and non-crossovers pathways. Also required for development of higher-order chromosome structures and is needed for synaptonemal-complex formation. In males, required for efficient synapsis of the sex chromosomes and for sex body formation. Promotes early steps of the DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair process upstream of the assembly of RAD51 complexes. Required for depletion of HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 from synapsed chromosomes (By similarity). Plays a role in mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) activation (PubMed:28553959).
