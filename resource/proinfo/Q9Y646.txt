UniprotID	Q9Y646
Accession	Q9Y646;B2RD88;Q8NBZ1;Q9UNM8;Q9Y5X6
EntryName	CBPQ_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carboxypeptidase Q (EC 3.4.17.-) (Lysosomal dipeptidase) (Plasma glutamate carboxypeptidase)
GeneName	CPQ LCH1 PGCP
Length	472
Function	Carboxypeptidase that may play an important role in the hydrolysis of circulating peptides. Catalyzes the hydrolysis of dipeptides with unsubstituted terminals into amino acids. May play a role in the liberation of thyroxine hormone from its thyroglobulin (Tg) precursor.
