EntryName	HAOX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	2-Hydroxyacid oxidase 2 (HAOX2) (EC 1.1.3.15) ((S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase, peroxisomal) (Cell growth-inhibiting gene 16 protein) (Long chain alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase) (Long-chain L-2-hydroxy acid oxidase)
GeneName	HAO2 HAOX2 GIG16
Length	351
Function	Oxidase that catalyzes the oxidation of medium and long chain hydroxyacids such as 2-hydroxyhexadecanoate and 2-hydroxyoctanoate, to the correspondong 2-oxoacids (PubMed:10777549). Its role in the oxidation of 2-hydroxy fatty acids may contribute to the general pathway of fatty acid alpha-oxidation (Probable). Active in vitro with the artificial electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP), but O2 is believed to be the physiological electron acceptor, leading to the production of H2O2. Is not active on glycolate, glyoxylate, L-lactate and 2-hydroxybutanoate (PubMed:10777549).
