UniprotID	P98172
Accession	P98172;D3DVU0
EntryName	EFNB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ephrin-B1 (EFL-3) (ELK ligand) (ELK-L) (EPH-related receptor tyrosine kinase ligand 2) (LERK-2) [Cleaved into: Ephrin-B1 C-terminal fragment (Ephrin-B1 CTF); Ephrin-B1 intracellular domain (Ephrin-B1 ICD)]
GeneName	EFNB1 EFL3 EPLG2 LERK2
Length	346
Function	Cell surface transmembrane ligand for Eph receptors, a family of receptor tyrosine kinases which are crucial for migration, repulsion and adhesion during neuronal, vascular and epithelial development (PubMed:7973638, PubMed:8070404). Binding to Eph receptors residing on adjacent cells leads to contact-dependent bidirectional signaling into neighboring cells (PubMed:7973638, PubMed:8070404). Shows high affinity for the receptor tyrosine kinase EPHB1/ELK (PubMed:7973638, PubMed:8070404). Can also bind EPHB2 and EPHB3 (PubMed:8070404). Binds to, and induces collapse of, commissural axons/growth cones in vitro (By similarity). May play a role in constraining the orientation of longitudinally projecting axons (By similarity).
