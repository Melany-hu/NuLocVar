UniprotID	P49336
Accession	P49336;Q5VUF3;Q6ISB5
EntryName	CDK8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (EC 2.7.11.22) (EC 2.7.11.23) (Cell division protein kinase 8) (Mediator complex subunit CDK8) (Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit CDK8) (Protein kinase K35)
GeneName	CDK8
Length	464
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in regulated gene transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional pre-initiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors. Phosphorylates the CTD (C-terminal domain) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAp II), which may inhibit the formation of a transcription initiation complex. Phosphorylates CCNH leading to down-regulation of the TFIIH complex and transcriptional repression. Recruited through interaction with MAML1 to hyperphosphorylate the intracellular domain of NOTCH, leading to its degradation.
