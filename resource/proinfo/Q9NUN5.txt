EntryName	LMBD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysosomal cobalamin transport escort protein LMBD1 (LMBD1) (HDAg-L-interacting protein NESI) (LMBR1 domain-containing protein 1) (Nuclear export signal-interacting protein)
GeneName	LMBRD1 C6orf209 NESI BM-021 CD001 MSTP044
Length	540
Function	Lysosomal membrane chaperone required to export cobalamin (vitamin B12) from the lysosome to the cytosol, allowing its conversion to cofactors (PubMed:19136951). Targets ABCD4 transporter from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome (PubMed:27456980). Then forms a complex with lysosomal ABCD4 and cytoplasmic MMACHC to transport cobalamin across the lysosomal membrane (PubMed:25535791). Acts as an adapter protein which plays an important role in mediating and regulating the internalization of the insulin receptor (INSR) (By similarity). Involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of INSR via its interaction with adapter protein complex 2 (By similarity). Essential for the initiation of gastrulation and early formation of mesoderm structures during embryogenesis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Lysosome membrane; Cell membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle
