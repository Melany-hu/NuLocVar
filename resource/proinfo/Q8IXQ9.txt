UniprotID	Q8IXQ9
Accession	Q8IXQ9;D3DUW3
EntryName	ETKMT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Electron transfer flavoprotein beta subunit lysine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.-) (ETFB lysine methyltransferase) (ETFB-KMT) (Protein N-lysine methyltransferase METTL20)
GeneName	ETFBKMT C12orf72 METTL20
Length	262
Function	Protein-lysine methyltransferase that selectively trimethylates the flavoprotein ETFB in mitochondria (PubMed:25023281, PubMed:25416781). Thereby, may negatively regulate the function of ETFB in electron transfer from Acyl-CoA dehydrogenases to the main respiratory chain (PubMed:25416781).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Mitochondrion matrix
