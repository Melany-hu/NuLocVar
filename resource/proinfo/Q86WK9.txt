UniprotID	Q86WK9
Accession	Q86WK9;A2A2D3;Q5XKF9;Q86VE4
EntryName	PAQR7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Membrane progestin receptor alpha (mPR alpha) (Membrane progesterone P4 receptor alpha) (Membrane progesterone receptor alpha) (Progesterone and adipoQ receptor family member 7) (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 7) (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member VII)
GeneName	PAQR7 MRPA
Length	346
Function	Plasma membrane progesterone (P4) receptor coupled to G proteins (PubMed:23763432). Seems to act through a G(i) mediated pathway (PubMed:23763432). May be involved in oocyte maturation (PubMed:12601167). Involved in neurosteroid inhibition of apoptosis (PubMed:23161870). Also binds dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), pregnanolone, pregnenolone and allopregnanolone (PubMed:23161870).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
