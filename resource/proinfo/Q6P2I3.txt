UniprotID	Q6P2I3
Accession	Q6P2I3;D3DXH7;Q8NDK1
EntryName	FAH2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Oxaloacetate tautomerase FAHD2B, mitochondrial (EC 5.3.2.2) (Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase domain-containing protein 2B)
GeneName	FAHD2B
Length	314
Function	Tautomerase that converts enol-oxaloacetate, a strong inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, to the physiological keto form of oxaloacetate (PubMed:38287013). It is thereby required to maximize aerobic respiration efficiency by preventing succinate dehydrogenase inhibition (PubMed:38287013).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
