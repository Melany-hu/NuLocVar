Accession	P28062;B0UZC0;Q29824;Q5JNW6;Q5QNR8;Q96J48
EntryName	PSB8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteasome subunit beta type-8 (EC 3.4.25.1) (Low molecular mass protein 7) (Macropain subunit C13) (Multicatalytic endopeptidase complex subunit C13) (Proteasome component C13) (Proteasome subunit beta-5i) (Really interesting new gene 10 protein)
GeneName	PSMB8 LMP7 PSMB5i RING10 Y2
Length	276
Function	The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex which is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu adjacent to the leaving group at neutral or slightly basic pH. The proteasome has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity. This subunit is involved in antigen processing to generate class I binding peptides. Replacement of PSMB5 by PSMB8 increases the capacity of the immunoproteasome to cleave model peptides after hydrophobic and basic residues. Involved in the generation of spliced peptides resulting from the ligation of two separate proteasomal cleavage products that are not contiguous in the parental protein (PubMed:27049119). Acts as a major component of interferon gamma-induced sensitivity. Plays a key role in apoptosis via the degradation of the apoptotic inhibitor MCL1. May be involved in the inflammatory response pathway. In cancer cells, substitution of isoform 1 (E2) by isoform 2 (E1) results in immunoproteasome deficiency. Required for the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes.
