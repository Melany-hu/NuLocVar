UniprotID	O95258
Accession	O95258;D3DTG2;Q0VDH7;Q9HC60;Q9HC61
EntryName	UCP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Brain mitochondrial carrier protein 1 (BMCP-1) (Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 5) (UCP 5) (Solute carrier family 25 member 14)
GeneName	SLC25A14 BMCP1 UCP5 UNQ791/PRO1682
Length	325
Function	Transports inorganic anions (sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate and phosphate) and, to a lesser extent, a variety of dicarboxylates (e.g. malonate, malate and citramalate) and, even more so, aspartate and glutamate and tricarboxylates (PubMed:31356773). May catalyze the export of sulfite and thiosulfate (the hydrogen sulfide degradation products) from the mitochondria, thereby modulating the level of the hydrogen sulfide (Probable). Also can mediate a very low unidirectional transport of anions including sulfate, phosphate, (S)-malate, citrate, L-aspartate and L-glutamate (PubMed:31356773). Maintains oxidative balance (through uncoupling activities) and ATP production (by modifying mitochondrial membrane potential) (PubMed:20600837). Is able to transport protons across lipid membranes (PubMed:22524567, PubMed:26182433). Also exhibits transmembrane chloride transport activity to a lesser extent (PubMed:22524567, PubMed:26182433). May modify mitochondrial respiratory efficiency and mitochondrial oxidant production (By similarity).
