UniprotID	Q16143
Accession	Q16143;Q6IAX7
EntryName	SYUB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-synuclein
GeneName	SNCB
Length	134
Function	Non-amyloid component of senile plaques found in Alzheimer disease. Could act as a regulator of SNCA aggregation process. Protects neurons from staurosporine and 6-hydroxy dopamine (6OHDA)-stimulated caspase activation in a p53/TP53-dependent manner. Contributes to restore the SNCA anti-apoptotic function abolished by 6OHDA. Not found in the Lewy bodies associated with Parkinson disease.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
