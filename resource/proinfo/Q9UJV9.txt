EntryName	DDX41_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX41 (EC 3.6.4.13) (DEAD box protein 41) (DEAD box protein abstrakt homolog)
GeneName	DDX41 ABS
Length	622
Function	Multifunctional protein that participates in many aspects of cellular RNA metabolism. Plays pivotal roles in innate immune sensing and hematopoietic homeostasis (PubMed:34473945). Recognizes foreign or self-nucleic acids generated during microbial infection, thereby initiating anti-pathogen responses (PubMed:23222971). Mechanistically, phosphorylation by BTK allows binding to dsDNA leading to interaction with STING1 (PubMed:25704810). Modulates the homeostasis of dsDNA through its ATP-dependent DNA-unwinding activity and ATP-independent strand-annealing activity (PubMed:35613581). In turn, induces STING1-mediated type I interferon and cytokine responses to DNA and DNA viruses (PubMed:35613581). Selectively modulates the transcription of certain immunity-associated genes by regulating their alternative splicing (PubMed:33650667). Binds to RNA (R)-loops, structures consisting of DNA/RNA hybrids and a displaced strand of DNA that occur during transcription, and prevents their accumulation, thereby maintaining genome stability (PubMed:36229594). Also participates in pre-mRNA splicing, translational regulation and snoRNA processing, which is essential for ribosome biogenesis (PubMed:36229594, PubMed:36780110).
