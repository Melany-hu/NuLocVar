EntryName	PNPT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase 1, mitochondrial (EC 2.7.7.8) (3'-5' RNA exonuclease OLD35) (PNPase old-35) (Polynucleotide phosphorylase 1) (PNPase 1) (Polynucleotide phosphorylase-like protein)
GeneName	PNPT1 PNPASE
Length	783
Function	RNA-binding protein implicated in numerous RNA metabolic processes (PubMed:29967381, PubMed:39019044). Catalyzes the phosphorolysis of single-stranded polyribonucleotides processively in the 3'-to-5' direction (PubMed:29967381, PubMed:39019044). Mitochondrial intermembrane factor with RNA-processing exoribonulease activity (PubMed:29967381, PubMed:39019044). Component of the mitochondrial degradosome (mtEXO) complex, that degrades 3' overhang double-stranded RNA with a 3'-to-5' directionality in an ATP-dependent manner (PubMed:29967381, PubMed:39019044). Involved in the degradation of non-coding mitochondrial transcripts (MT-ncRNA) and tRNA-like molecules (PubMed:29967381, PubMed:39019044). Required for correct processing and polyadenylation of mitochondrial mRNAs. Plays a role as a cytoplasmic RNA import factor that mediates the translocation of small RNA components, like the 5S RNA, the RNA subunit of ribonuclease P and the mitochondrial RNA-processing (MRP) RNA, into the mitochondrial matrix. Plays a role in mitochondrial morphogenesis and respiration; regulates the expression of the electron transport chain (ETC) components at the mRNA and protein levels. In the cytoplasm, shows a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease mediating mRNA degradation activity; degrades c-myc mRNA upon treatment with IFNB1/IFN-beta, resulting in a growth arrest in melanoma cells. Regulates the stability of specific mature miRNAs in melanoma cells; specifically and selectively degrades miR-221, preferentially. Also plays a role in RNA cell surveillance by cleaning up oxidized RNAs. Binds to the RNA subunit of ribonuclease P, MRP RNA and miR-221 microRNA.
