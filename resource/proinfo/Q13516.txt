UniprotID	Q13516
Accession	Q13516;B3KRF3;Q05BP9;Q49AL3;Q86X04;Q9NZ14
EntryName	OLIG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (Oligo2) (Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 1) (bHLHb1) (Class E basic helix-loop-helix protein 19) (bHLHe19) (Protein kinase C-binding protein 2) (Protein kinase C-binding protein RACK17)
GeneName	OLIG2 BHLHB1 BHLHE19 PRKCBP2 RACK17
Length	323
Function	Required for oligodendrocyte and motor neuron specification in the spinal cord, as well as for the development of somatic motor neurons in the hindbrain. Functions together with ZNF488 to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation. Cooperates with OLIG1 to establish the pMN domain of the embryonic neural tube. Antagonist of V2 interneuron and of NKX2-2-induced V3 interneuron development.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm
