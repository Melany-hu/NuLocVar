UniprotID	A6NJH9
Accession	A6NJH9
EntryName	A6NJH9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4C
GeneName	EIF1AY
Length	127
Function	Component of the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC), which binds to the mRNA cap-proximal region, scans mRNA 5'-untranslated region, and locates the initiation codon. This protein enhances formation of the cap-proximal complex. Together with EIF1, facilitates scanning, start codon recognition, promotion of the assembly of 48S complex at the initiation codon (43S PIC becomes 48S PIC after the start codon is reached), and dissociation of aberrant complexes. After start codon location, together with EIF5B orients the initiator methionine-tRNA in a conformation that allows 60S ribosomal subunit joining to form the 80S initiation complex. Is released after 80S initiation complex formation, just after GTP hydrolysis by EIF5B, and before release of EIF5B. Its globular part is located in the A site of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Its interaction with EIF5 during scanning contribute to the maintenance of EIF1 within the open 43S PIC. In contrast to yeast orthologs, does not bind EIF1.
