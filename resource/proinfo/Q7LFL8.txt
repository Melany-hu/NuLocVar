EntryName	CXXC5_HUMAN
ProteinName	CXXC-type zinc finger protein 5 (CF5) (Putative MAPK-activating protein PM08) (Putative NF-kappa-B-activating protein 102) (Retinoid-inducible nuclear factor) (RINF)
GeneName	CXXC5 HSPC195 TCCCIA00297
Length	322
Function	May indirectly participate in activation of the NF-kappa-B and MAPK pathways. Acts as a mediator of BMP4-mediated modulation of canonical Wnt signaling activity in neural stem cells (By similarity). Required for DNA damage-induced ATM phosphorylation, p53 activation and cell cycle arrest. Involved in myelopoiesis. Transcription factor. Binds to the oxygen responsive element of COX4I2 and represses its transcription under hypoxia conditions (4% oxygen), as well as normoxia conditions (20% oxygen) (PubMed:23303788). May repress COX4I2 transactivation induced by CHCHD2 and RBPJ (PubMed:23303788). Binds preferentially to DNA containing cytidine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) dinucleotides over CpH (H=A, T, and C), hemimethylated-CpG and hemimethylated-hydroxymethyl-CpG (PubMed:29276034).
