EntryName	RNF14_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF14 (EC 2.3.2.31) (Androgen receptor-associated protein 54) (HFB30) (RING finger protein 14)
GeneName	RNF14 ARA54 HRIHFB2038
Length	474
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a key role in the RNF14-RNF25 translation quality control pathway, a pathway that takes place when a ribosome has stalled during translation, and which promotes ubiquitination and degradation of translation factors on stalled ribosomes (PubMed:36638793, PubMed:37651229, PubMed:37951215, PubMed:37951216). Recruited to stalled ribosomes by the ribosome collision sensor GCN1 and mediates 'Lys-6'-linked ubiquitination of target proteins, leading to their degradation (PubMed:36638793, PubMed:37651229, PubMed:37951215, PubMed:37951216). Mediates ubiquitination of EEF1A1/eEF1A and ETF1/eRF1 translation factors on stalled ribosomes, leading to their degradation (PubMed:36638793, PubMed:37651229). Also catalyzes ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins RPL0, RPL1, RPL12, RPS13 and RPS17 (PubMed:36638793). Specifically required to resolve RNA-protein cross-links caused by reactive aldehydes, which trigger translation stress by stalling ribosomes: acts by catalying 'Lys-6'-linked ubiquitination of RNA-protein cross-links, leading to their removal by the ATP-dependent unfoldase VCP and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:37951215, PubMed:37951216). Independently of its function in the response to stalled ribosomes, acts as a regulator of transcription in Wnt signaling via its interaction with TCF transcription factors (TCF7/TCF1, TCF7L1/TCF3 and TCF7L2/TCF4) (PubMed:23449499). May also play a role as a coactivator for androgen- and, to a lesser extent, progesterone-dependent transcription (PubMed:19345326).
