UniprotID	Q9BYQ2
Accession	Q9BYQ2;Q0VAE3
EntryName	KRA94_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 9-4 (Keratin-associated protein 9.4) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 9.4)
GeneName	KRTAP9-4 KAP9.4 KRTAP9.4
Length	154
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
