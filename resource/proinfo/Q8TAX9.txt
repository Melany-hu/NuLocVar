UniprotID	Q8TAX9
Accession	Q8TAX9;B4DKK7;Q7Z377;Q8WY76;Q9NX71;Q9P163
EntryName	GSDMB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gasdermin-B (Gasdermin-like protein) [Cleaved into: Gasdermin-B, N-terminal (GSDMB-NT) (p30); Gasdermin-B, C-terminal (GSDMB-CT) (p16)]
GeneName	GSDMB GSDML PP4052 PRO2521
Length	416
Function	Precursor of a pore-forming protein that acts as a downstream mediator of granzyme-mediated cell death (PubMed:32299851). This form constitutes the precursor of the pore-forming protein: upon cleavage, the released N-terminal moiety (Gasdermin-B, N-terminal) binds to membranes and forms pores, triggering pyroptosis (PubMed:32299851). Also acts as a regulator of epithelial cell repair independently of programmed cell death: translocates to the plasma membrane and promotes epithelial maintenance and repair by regulating PTK2/FAK-mediated phosphorylation of PDGFA (PubMed:35021065).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cell membrane
