UniprotID	O95947
Accession	O95947;Q8TAS4;Q9HA44
EntryName	TBX6_HUMAN
ProteinName	T-box transcription factor TBX6 (T-box protein 6)
GeneName	TBX6
Length	436
Function	T-box transcription factor that plays an essential role in the determination of the fate of axial stem cells: neural vs mesodermal. Acts in part by down-regulating, a specific enhancer (N1) of SOX2, to inhibit neural development. Seems to play also an essential role in left/right axis determination and acts through effects on Notch signaling around the node as well as through an effect on the morphology and motility of the nodal cilia (By similarity).
