Accession	Q96BY9;B3KQQ4;B7Z9J1;D3DSU7;H9MHJ8;H9MHJ9;Q53HE8;Q9UNZ3;Q9Y683
EntryName	SARAF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Store-operated calcium entry-associated regulatory factor (SARAF) (SOCE-associated regulatory factor) (HBV X-transactivated gene 3 protein) (HBV XAg-transactivated protein 3) (Protein FOAP-7) (Transmembrane protein 66)
GeneName	SARAF TMEM66 XTP3 HSPC035 NPD003 PSEC0019 UNQ1967/PRO4499
Length	339
Function	Negative regulator of store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) involved in protecting cells from Ca(2+) overfilling. In response to cytosolic Ca(2+) elevation after endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) refilling, promotes a slow inactivation of STIM (STIM1 or STIM2)-dependent SOCE activity: possibly act by facilitating the deoligomerization of STIM to efficiently turn off ORAI when the endoplasmic reticulum lumen is filled with the appropriate Ca(2+) levels, and thus preventing the overload of the cell with excessive Ca(2+) ions.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
