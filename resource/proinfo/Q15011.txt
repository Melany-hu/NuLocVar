UniprotID	Q15011
Accession	Q15011;E9PGD1;O60644;Q6IAN8;Q96D92
EntryName	HERP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homocysteine-responsive endoplasmic reticulum-resident ubiquitin-like domain member 1 protein (Methyl methanesulfonate (MMF)-inducible fragment protein 1)
GeneName	HERPUD1 HERP KIAA0025 MIF1
Length	391
Function	Component of the endoplasmic reticulum quality control (ERQC) system also called ER-associated degradation (ERAD) involved in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of misfolded endoplasmic reticulum proteins (PubMed:16289116, PubMed:28827405). Could enhance presenilin-mediated amyloid-beta protein 40 generation. Binds to ubiquilins and this interaction is required for efficient degradation of CD3D via the ERAD pathway (PubMed:18307982).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
