Accession	Q86VF5;Q496A6;Q496A7;Q496A8;Q9UDW7
EntryName	MOGT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	2-acylglycerol O-acyltransferase 3 (EC 2.3.1.20) (EC 2.3.1.22) (Acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 3) (MGAT3) (Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase candidate 7) (hDC7) (Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2-like protein 7) (Monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 3)
GeneName	MOGAT3 DC7 DGAT2L7 UNQ9383/PRO34208
Length	341
Function	Catalyzes the formation of diacylglycerol from 2-monoacylglycerol and fatty acyl-CoA. Also able to catalyze the terminal step in triacylglycerol synthesis by using diacylglycerol and fatty acyl-CoA as substrates. Has a preference toward palmitoyl-CoA and oleoyl-CoA. May be involved in absorption of dietary fat in the small intestine by catalyzing the resynthesis of triacylglycerol in enterocytes. Also able to use 1-monoalkylglycerol (1-MAkG) as an acyl acceptor for the synthesis of monoalkyl-monoacylglycerol (MAMAG) (PubMed:28420705).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region
