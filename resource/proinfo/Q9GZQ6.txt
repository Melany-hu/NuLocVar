UniprotID	Q9GZQ6
Accession	Q9GZQ6;A2RRF0;Q8NGR0;Q96RN3
EntryName	NPFF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neuropeptide FF receptor 1 (G-protein coupled receptor 147) (RFamide-related peptide receptor OT7T022)
GeneName	NPFFR1 GPR147 NPFF1
Length	430
Function	Receptor for NPAF (A-18-F-amide) and NPFF (F-8-F-amide) neuropeptides, also known as morphine-modulating peptides. Can also be activated by a variety of naturally occurring or synthetic FMRF-amide like ligands. This receptor mediates its action by association with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
