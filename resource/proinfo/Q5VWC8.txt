UniprotID	Q5VWC8
Accession	Q5VWC8;Q7Z385
EntryName	HACD4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 4 (EC 4.2.1.134) (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 4) (HACD4) (Protein-tyrosine phosphatase-like A domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	HACD4 PTPLAD2
Length	232
Function	Catalyzes the third of the four reactions of the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle. This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process, allows the addition of two carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids/VLCFAs per cycle. This enzyme catalyzes the dehydration of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate into trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA, within each cycle of fatty acid elongation. Thereby, it participates in the production of VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
