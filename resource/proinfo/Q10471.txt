UniprotID	Q10471
Accession	Q10471;A8K1Y3;B7Z8V8;C5HU00;Q9NPY4
EntryName	GALT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (EC 2.4.1.41) (Polypeptide GalNAc transferase 2) (GalNAc-T2) (pp-GaNTase 2) (Protein-UDP acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2) (UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2) [Cleaved into: Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 soluble form]
GeneName	GALNT2
Length	571
Function	Catalyzes the initial reaction in O-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis, the transfer of an N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residue to a serine or threonine residue on the protein receptor. Has a broad spectrum of substrates for peptides such as EA2, Muc5AC, Muc1a, Muc1b. Probably involved in O-linked glycosylation of the immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) hinge region. Involved in O-linked glycosylation of APOC-III, ANGPTL3 and PLTP. It participates in the regulation of HDL-C metabolism (PubMed:27508872, PubMed:32293671).
