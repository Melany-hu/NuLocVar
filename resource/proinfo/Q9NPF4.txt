UniprotID	Q9NPF4
Accession	Q9NPF4;Q6IAC3
EntryName	OSGEP_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA N6-adenosine threonylcarbamoyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.234) (N6-L-threonylcarbamoyladenine synthase) (t(6)A synthase) (O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase) (hOSGEP) (t(6)A37 threonylcarbamoyladenosine biosynthesis protein OSGEP) (tRNA threonylcarbamoyladenosine biosynthesis protein OSGEP)
GeneName	OSGEP GCPL1
Length	335
Function	Component of the EKC/KEOPS complex that is required for the formation of a threonylcarbamoyl group on adenosine at position 37 (t(6)A37) in tRNAs that read codons beginning with adenine. The complex is probably involved in the transfer of the threonylcarbamoyl moiety of threonylcarbamoyl-AMP (TC-AMP) to the N6 group of A37. OSGEP likely plays a direct catalytic role in this reaction, but requires other protein(s) of the complex to fulfill this activity.
