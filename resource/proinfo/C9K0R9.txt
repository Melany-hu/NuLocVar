UniprotID	C9K0R9
Accession	C9K0R9
EntryName	C9K0R9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1
GeneName	IMPDH1
Length	289
Function	Catalyzes the conversion of inosine 5'-phosphate (IMP) to xanthosine 5'-phosphate (XMP), the first committed and rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, and therefore plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth. Could also have a single-stranded nucleic acid-binding activity and could play a role in RNA and/or DNA metabolism. It may also have a role in the development of malignancy and the growth progression of some tumors.
