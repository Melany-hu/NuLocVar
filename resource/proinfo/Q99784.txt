UniprotID	Q99784
Accession	Q99784;Q53XZ8;Q6IMJ4;Q6IMJ5;Q8N8R0;Q969S7;Q99452
EntryName	NOE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Noelin (Neuronal olfactomedin-related ER localized protein) (Olfactomedin-1)
GeneName	OLFM1 NOE1 NOEL1
Length	485
Function	Contributes to the regulation of axonal growth in the embryonic and adult central nervous system by inhibiting interactions between RTN4R and LINGO1. Inhibits RTN4R-mediated axon growth cone collapse (By similarity). May play an important role in regulating the production of neural crest cells by the neural tube (By similarity). May be required for normal responses to olfactory stimuli (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Synapse; Endoplasmic reticulum; Cell projection; Axon; Perikaryon
