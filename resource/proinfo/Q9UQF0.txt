UniprotID	Q9UQF0
Accession	Q9UQF0;B2RPD4;O95244;O95245;Q8NHY7;Q9NRZ2;Q9NZG3
EntryName	SYCY1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Syncytin-1 (Endogenous retrovirus group W member 1) (Env-W) (Envelope polyprotein gPr73) (Enverin) (HERV-7q Envelope protein) (HERV-W envelope protein) (HERV-W_7q21.2 provirus ancestral Env polyprotein) (Syncytin) [Cleaved into: Surface protein (SU) (gp50); Transmembrane protein (TM) (gp24)]
GeneName	ERVW-1 ERVWE1
Length	538
Function	This endogenous retroviral envelope protein has retained its original fusogenic properties and participates in trophoblast fusion and the formation of a syncytium during placenta morphogenesis. May induce fusion through binding of SLC1A4 and SLC1A5 (PubMed:10708449, PubMed:12050356, PubMed:23492904).
