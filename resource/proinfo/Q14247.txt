GeneName	CTTN EMS1
Length	550
Function	Contributes to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell shape (PubMed:21296879). Plays a role in the formation of lamellipodia and in cell migration. Plays a role in the regulation of neuron morphology, axon growth and formation of neuronal growth cones (By similarity). Through its interaction with CTTNBP2, involved in the regulation of neuronal spine density (By similarity). Plays a role in focal adhesion assembly and turnover (By similarity). In complex with ABL1 and MYLK regulates cortical actin-based cytoskeletal rearrangement critical to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)-mediated endothelial cell (EC) barrier enhancement (PubMed:20861316). Plays a role in intracellular protein transport and endocytosis, and in modulating the levels of potassium channels present at the cell membrane (PubMed:17959782). Plays a role in receptor-mediated endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (By similarity). Required for stabilization of KCNH1 channels at the cell membrane (PubMed:23144454). Plays a role in the invasiveness of cancer cells, and the formation of metastases (PubMed:16636290).
