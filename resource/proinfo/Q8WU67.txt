Accession	Q8WU67;B0YIV0;B7Z5C2;O43411
EntryName	ABHD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phospholipase ABHD3 (EC 3.1.1.32) (EC 3.1.1.4) (Abhydrolase domain-containing protein 3)
GeneName	ABHD3
Length	409
Function	Phospholipase that may play a role in phospholipids remodeling. May selectively cleave myristate (C14)-containing phosphatidylcholines through its predominant phospholipase 1 activity, cleaving preferentially acyl groups in sn1 position. In parallel, may have a minor phospholipase 2 activity acting on acyl groups in position sn2. In addition to (C14)-containing phosphatidylcholines, may also act on other medium-chain-containing and oxidatively truncated phospholipids.
