UniprotID	Q9NX18
Accession	Q9NX18
EntryName	SDHF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Succinate dehydrogenase assembly factor 2, mitochondrial (SDH assembly factor 2) (SDHAF2)
GeneName	SDHAF2 C11orf79 PGL2 SDH5
Length	166
Function	Plays an essential role in the assembly of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), an enzyme complex (also referred to as respiratory complex II) that is a component of both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and which couples the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with the reduction of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) to ubiquinol. Required for flavinylation (covalent attachment of FAD) of the flavoprotein subunit SDHA of the SDH catalytic dimer.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
