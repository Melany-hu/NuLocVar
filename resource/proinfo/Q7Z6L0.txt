UniprotID	Q7Z6L0
Accession	Q7Z6L0;A8K8M8;Q8N2N8;Q8NAQ7;Q8ND36;Q96FA8
EntryName	PRRT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (Dispanin subfamily B member 3) (DSPB3)
GeneName	PRRT2
Length	340
Function	As a component of the outer core of AMPAR complex, may be involved in synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. In hippocampal neurons, in presynaptic terminals, plays an important role in the final steps of neurotransmitter release, possibly by regulating Ca(2+)-sensing. In the cerebellum, may inhibit SNARE complex formation and down-regulate short-term facilitation.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Presynaptic cell membrane; Synapse; Cell projection; Axon; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane; Postsynaptic density membrane; Cell projection; Dendritic spine
