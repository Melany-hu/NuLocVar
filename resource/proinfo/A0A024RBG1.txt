UniprotID	A0A024RBG1
Accession	A0A024RBG1
EntryName	NUD4B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase NUDT4B (DIPP-2B) (EC 3.6.1.52) (Nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X motif 4B) (Nudix motif 4B) (Nudix hydrolase 4B)
GeneName	NUDT4B
Length	181
Function	Cleaves a beta-phosphate from the diphosphate groups in PP-InsP5 (diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate), PP-InsP4 and 2-InsP4 (bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate), suggesting that it may play a role in signal transduction. Also able to catalyze the hydrolysis of dinucleoside oligophosphate Ap6A, but not Ap5A. The major reaction products are ADP and p4a from Ap6A. Also able to hydrolyze 5-phosphoribose 1-diphosphate. Does not play a role in U8 snoRNA decapping activity. Binds U8 snoRNA.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
