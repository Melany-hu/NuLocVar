UniprotID	Q15834
Accession	Q15834;B2R598;Q96HA0
EntryName	CC85B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 85B (Hepatitis delta antigen-interacting protein A) (Delta-interacting protein A)
GeneName	CCDC85B DIPA
Length	202
Function	Functions as a transcriptional repressor (PubMed:17014843). May inhibit the activity of CTNNB1 in a TP53-dependent manner and thus regulate cell growth (PubMed:17873903). May function in adipocyte differentiation, negatively regulating mitotic clonal expansion (By similarity). Plays a role in cell-cell adhesion and epithelium development through its interaction with proteins of the beta-catenin family (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome; Cell junction; Adherens junction
