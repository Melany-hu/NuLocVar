UniprotID	Q99439
Accession	Q99439;A5D8U8;A6NFI4;D6W5X9;Q92578
EntryName	CNN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calponin-2 (Calponin H2, smooth muscle) (Neutral calponin)
GeneName	CNN2
Length	309
Function	Thin filament-associated protein that is implicated in the regulation and modulation of smooth muscle contraction. It is capable of binding to actin, calmodulin and tropomyosin. The interaction of calponin with actin inhibits the actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity.
