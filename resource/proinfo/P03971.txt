EntryName	MIS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Muellerian-inhibiting factor (Anti-Muellerian hormone) (AMH) (Muellerian-inhibiting substance) (MIS)
GeneName	AMH MIF
Length	560
Function	Plays an important role in several reproductive functions. Induces Muellerian duct regression during male fetal sexual differentiation (PubMed:34155118, PubMed:3754790, PubMed:8469238). Also plays a role in Leydig cell differentiation and function (By similarity). In female acts as a negative regulator of the primordial to primary follicle transition and decreases FSH sensitivity of growing follicles (PubMed:14742691). AMH signals by binding to a specific type-II receptor, AMHR2, that heterodimerizes with type-I receptors (ACVR1 and BMPR1A), and recruiting SMAD proteins that are translocated to the nucleus to regulate target gene expression (PubMed:20861221, PubMed:34155118).
