UniprotID	Q8WVX9
Accession	Q8WVX9;D3DQW8;Q5CZA3
EntryName	FACR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (FAR1) (EC 1.2.1.84) (Male sterility domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	FAR1 MLSTD2 UNQ2423/PRO4981
Length	515
Function	Catalyzes the reduction of saturated and unsaturated C16 or C18 fatty acyl-CoA to fatty alcohols (PubMed:15220348, PubMed:24108123, PubMed:35238077). It plays an essential role in the production of ether lipids/plasmalogens which synthesis requires fatty alcohols (PubMed:20071337, PubMed:24108123, PubMed:33239752). In parallel, it is also required for wax monoesters production since fatty alcohols also constitute a substrate for their synthesis (By similarity) (PubMed:24108123, PubMed:35238077).
