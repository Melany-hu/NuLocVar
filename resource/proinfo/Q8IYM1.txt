EntryName	SEP12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Septin-12
GeneName	SEPTIN12 SEPT12
Length	358
Function	Filament-forming cytoskeletal GTPase (By similarity). Involved in spermatogenesis. Involved in the morphogenesis of sperm heads and the elongation of sperm tails probably implicating the association with alpha- and beta-tubulins (PubMed:24213608). Forms a filamentous structure with SEPTIN7, SEPTIN6, SEPTIN2 and probably SEPTIN4 at the sperm annulus which is required for the structural integrity and motility of the sperm tail during postmeiotic differentiation (PubMed:25588830). May play a role in cytokinesis (Potential).
