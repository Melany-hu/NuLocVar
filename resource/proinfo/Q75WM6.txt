UniprotID	Q75WM6
Accession	Q75WM6;Q147U8;Q5GKZ5;Q7Z694
EntryName	H1FNT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Testis-specific H1 histone (Haploid germ cell-specific nuclear protein 1) (Histone H1.7) (Histone H1t2)
GeneName	H1-7 H1FNT HANP1
Length	255
Function	Essential for normal spermatogenesis and male fertility (PubMed:16533358). Required for proper cell restructuring and DNA condensation during the elongation phase of spermiogenesis. Involved in the histone-protamine transition of sperm chromatin and the subsequent production of functional sperm. Binds both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA, ATP and protamine-1.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
