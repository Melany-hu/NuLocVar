UniprotID	P62341
Accession	P62341;O95904;Q8IY80;Q9CZ45;Q9NZJ3
EntryName	SELT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thioredoxin reductase-like selenoprotein T (SelT) (EC 1.8.1.9)
GeneName	SELENOT SELT UNQ150/PRO176
Length	195
Function	Selenoprotein with thioredoxin reductase-like oxidoreductase activity (By similarity). Protects dopaminergic neurons against oxidative stress and cell death (PubMed:26866473). Involved in ADCYAP1/PACAP-induced calcium mobilization and neuroendocrine secretion (By similarity). Plays a role in fibroblast anchorage and redox regulation (By similarity). In gastric smooth muscle, modulates the contraction processes through the regulation of calcium release and MYLK activation (By similarity). In pancreatic islets, involved in the control of glucose homeostasis, contributes to prolonged ADCYAP1/PACAP-induced insulin secretion (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
