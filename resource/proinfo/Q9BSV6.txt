UniprotID	Q9BSV6
Accession	Q9BSV6;A6NNB1;B0V3J1;Q9BVT1;Q9H6H5
EntryName	SEN34_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA-splicing endonuclease subunit Sen34 (EC 4.6.1.16) (Leukocyte receptor cluster member 5) (tRNA-intron endonuclease Sen34) (HsSen34)
GeneName	TSEN34 LENG5 SEN34
Length	310
Function	Constitutes one of the two catalytic subunit of the tRNA-splicing endonuclease complex, a complex responsible for identification and cleavage of the splice sites in pre-tRNA. It cleaves pre-tRNA at the 5'- and 3'-splice sites to release the intron. The products are an intron and two tRNA half-molecules bearing 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-OH termini. There are no conserved sequences at the splice sites, but the intron is invariably located at the same site in the gene, placing the splice sites an invariant distance from the constant structural features of the tRNA body. It probably carries the active site for 3'-splice site cleavage. The tRNA splicing endonuclease is also involved in mRNA processing via its association with pre-mRNA 3'-end processing factors, establishing a link between pre-tRNA splicing and pre-mRNA 3'-end formation, suggesting that the endonuclease subunits function in multiple RNA-processing events.
