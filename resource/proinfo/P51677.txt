Accession	P51677;B3KVQ1;F5GWL6;Q15748;Q2YDB9;Q86WD2;Q8TDP6;Q9ULY8
EntryName	CCR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C chemokine receptor type 3 (C C CKR3) (C-C CKR-3) (CC-CKR-3) (CCR-3) (CCR3) (CKR 3) (CKR3) (Eosinophil eotaxin receptor) (CD antigen CD193)
GeneName	CCR3 CMKBR3
Length	355
Function	Receptor for C-C type chemokine. Binds and responds to a variety of chemokines, including CCL11, CCL26, CCL7, CCL13, RANTES(CCL5) and CCL15 (PubMed:7622448, PubMed:8642344, PubMed:8676064). Subsequently transduces a signal by increasing the intracellular calcium ions level (PubMed:8676064). In addition acts as a possible functional receptor for NARS1 (PubMed:30171954).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
