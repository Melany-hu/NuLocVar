UniprotID	Q14542
Accession	Q14542;B3KPY7;G5E943;O43530;Q52M84;Q96R00;Q9UPE0
EntryName	S29A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (hENT2) (36 kDa nucleolar protein HNP36) (Delayed-early response protein 12) (Equilibrative nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside-insensitive nucleoside transporter) (Equilibrative NBMPR-insensitive nucleoside transporter) (Hydrophobic nucleolar protein, 36 kDa) (Nucleoside transporter, ei-type) (Solute carrier family 29 member 2)
GeneName	SLC29A2 DER12 ENT2 HNP36
Length	456
Function	Bidirectional uniporter involved in the facilitative transport of nucleosides and nucleobases, and contributes to maintaining their cellular homeostasis (PubMed:10722669, PubMed:12527552, PubMed:12590919, PubMed:16214850, PubMed:21795683, PubMed:9396714, PubMed:9478986). Functions as a Na(+)-independent, passive transporter (PubMed:9478986). Involved in the transport of nucleosides such as inosine, adenosine, uridine, thymidine, cytidine and guanosine (PubMed:10722669, PubMed:12527552, PubMed:12590919, PubMed:16214850, PubMed:21795683, PubMed:9396714, PubMed:9478986). Also able to transport purine nucleobases (hypoxanthine, adenine, guanine) and pyrimidine nucleobases (thymine, uracil) (PubMed:16214850, PubMed:21795683). Involved in nucleoside transport at basolateral membrane of kidney cells, allowing liver absorption of nucleoside metabolites (PubMed:12527552). Mediates apical nucleoside uptake into Sertoli cells, thereby regulating the transport of nucleosides in testis across the blood-testis-barrier (PubMed:23639800). Mediates both the influx and efflux of hypoxanthine in skeletal muscle microvascular endothelial cells to control the amount of intracellular hypoxanthine available for xanthine oxidase-mediated ROS production (By similarity).
