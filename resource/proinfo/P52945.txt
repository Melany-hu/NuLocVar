UniprotID	P52945
Accession	P52945;O60594;Q5VYW2
EntryName	PDX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein 1 (PDX-1) (Glucose-sensitive factor) (GSF) (Insulin promoter factor 1) (IPF-1) (Insulin upstream factor 1) (IUF-1) (Islet/duodenum homeobox-1) (IDX-1) (Somatostatin-transactivating factor 1) (STF-1)
GeneName	PDX1 IPF1 STF1
Length	283
Function	Activates insulin, somatostatin, glucokinase, islet amyloid polypeptide and glucose transporter type 2 gene transcription. Particularly involved in glucose-dependent regulation of insulin gene transcription. As part of a PDX1:PBX1b:MEIS2b complex in pancreatic acinar cells is involved in the transcriptional activation of the ELA1 enhancer; the complex binds to the enhancer B element and cooperates with the transcription factor 1 complex (PTF1) bound to the enhancer A element. Binds preferentially the DNA motif 5'-TAAT-3'. During development, specifies the early pancreatic epithelium, permitting its proliferation, branching and subsequent differentiation. At adult stage, required for maintaining the hormone-producing phenotype of the beta-cell.
