Accession	Q93062;D3DSU9;Q92516;Q92517;Q92518;Q96J26
EntryName	RBPMS_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing (RBP-MS) (RBPMS) (Heart and RRM expressed sequence) (Hermes)
GeneName	RBPMS HERMES
Length	196
Function	RNA binding protein that mediates the regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing (AS) (PubMed:24860013, PubMed:26347403). Acts either as activator (FLNB, HSPG2, LIPA1, MYOCD, PTPRF and PPFIBP1) or repressor (TPM1, ACTN1, ITGA7, PIEZO1, LSM14B, MBNL1 and MBML2) of splicing events on specific pre-mRNA targets (By similarity). Together with RNA binding proteins RBFOX2 and MBNL1/2, activates a splicing program associated with differentiated contractile vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) by regulating AS of numerous pre-mRNA involved in actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion machineries, suggesting a role in promoting a cell differentiated state (By similarity). Binds to introns, exons and 3'-UTR associated with tandem CAC trinucleotide motifs separated by a variable spacer region, at a minimum as a dimer. The minimal length of RNA required for RBPMS-binding tandem CAC motifs is 15 nt, with spacing ranging from 1 to 9 nt. Can also bind to CA dinucleotide repeats (PubMed:24860013, PubMed:26347403). Mediates repression of TPM1 exon 3 by binding to CAC tandem repeats in the flanking intronic regions, followed by higher-order oligomerization and heterotypic interactions with other splicing regulators including MBNL1 and RBFOX2, which prevents assembly of ATP-dependent splicing complexes (By similarity).
