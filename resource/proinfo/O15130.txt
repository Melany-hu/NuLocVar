UniprotID	O15130
Accession	O15130;Q3SXL4
EntryName	NPFF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pro-FMRFamide-related neuropeptide FF (FMRFamide-related peptides) [Cleaved into: Neuropeptide SF (NPSF); Neuropeptide FF (NPFF); Neuropeptide AF (NPAF)]
GeneName	NPFF
Length	113
Function	Morphine modulating peptides. Have wide-ranging physiologic effects, including the modulation of morphine-induced analgesia, elevation of arterial blood pressure, and increased somatostatin secretion from the pancreas. Neuropeptide FF potentiates and sensitizes ASIC1 and ASIC3 channels.
