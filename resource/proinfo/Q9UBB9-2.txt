UniprotID	Q9UBB9-2
Accession	Q9UBB9;O95908;Q20WL0;Q5H8V8;Q9UGV7;Q9Y2Q8
EntryName	TFP11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tuftelin-interacting protein 11 (Septin and tuftelin-interacting protein 1) (STIP-1)
GeneName	TFIP11 STIP HSPC006
Length	196
Function	Involved in pre-mRNA splicing, specifically in spliceosome disassembly during late-stage splicing events. Intron turnover seems to proceed through reactions in two lariat-intron associated complexes termed Intron Large (IL) and Intron Small (IS). In cooperation with DHX15 seems to mediate the transition of the U2, U5 and U6 snRNP-containing IL complex to the snRNP-free IS complex leading to efficient debranching and turnover of excised introns. May play a role in the differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts or in the forming of the enamel extracellular matrix.
