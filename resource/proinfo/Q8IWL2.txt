UniprotID	Q8IWL2
Accession	Q8IWL2;A8K3T8;B7ZW50;E3VLD8;E3VLD9;E3VLE0;E3VLE1;G5E9J3;P07714;Q14DV4;Q5RIR5;Q5RIR7;Q6PIT0;Q8TC19
EntryName	SFTA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pulmonary surfactant-associated protein A1 (PSP-A) (PSPA) (SP-A) (SP-A1) (35 kDa pulmonary surfactant-associated protein) (Alveolar proteinosis protein) (Collectin-4)
GeneName	SFTPA1 COLEC4 PSAP SFTP1 SFTPA SFTPA1B
Length	248
Function	In presence of calcium ions, it binds to surfactant phospholipids and contributes to lower the surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli of the mammalian lung and is essential for normal respiration. Enhances the expression of MYO18A/SP-R210 on alveolar macrophages (By similarity).
