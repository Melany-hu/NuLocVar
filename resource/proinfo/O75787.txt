EntryName	RENR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Renin receptor (ATPase H(+)-transporting lysosomal accessory protein 2) (ATPase H(+)-transporting lysosomal-interacting protein 2) (ER-localized type I transmembrane adapter) (Embryonic liver differentiation factor 10) (N14F) (Renin/prorenin receptor) (Vacuolar ATP synthase membrane sector-associated protein M8-9) (ATP6M8-9) (V-ATPase M8.9 subunit) [Cleaved into: Renin receptor N-terminal fragment; Renin receptor C-terminal fragment]
GeneName	ATP6AP2 ATP6IP2 CAPER ELDF10 HT028 MSTP009 PSEC0072
Length	350
Function	Multifunctional protein which functions as a renin, prorenin cellular receptor and is involved in the assembly of the lysosomal proton-transporting V-type ATPase (V-ATPase) and the acidification of the endo-lysosomal system (PubMed:12045255, PubMed:29127204, PubMed:30374053, PubMed:32276428). May mediate renin-dependent cellular responses by activating ERK1 and ERK2 (PubMed:12045255). By increasing the catalytic efficiency of renin in AGT/angiotensinogen conversion to angiotensin I, may also play a role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (PubMed:12045255). Through its function in V-type ATPase (v-ATPase) assembly and acidification of the lysosome it regulates protein degradation and may control different signaling pathways important for proper brain development, synapse morphology and synaptic transmission (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Lysosome membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome membrane; Cell projection; Dendritic spine membrane; Cell projection; Axon; Endosome membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Clathrin-coated vesicle membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane
