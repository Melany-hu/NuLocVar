UniprotID	P14207
Accession	P14207;Q05CA5;Q6GTE8
EntryName	FOLR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Folate receptor beta (FR-beta) (Folate receptor 2) (Folate receptor, fetal/placental) (Placental folate-binding protein) (FBP)
GeneName	FOLR2
Length	255
Function	Binds to folate and reduced folic acid derivatives and mediates delivery of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and folate analogs into the interior of cells. Has high affinity for folate and folic acid analogs at neutral pH. Exposure to slightly acidic pH after receptor endocytosis triggers a conformation change that strongly reduces its affinity for folates and mediates their release.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted
