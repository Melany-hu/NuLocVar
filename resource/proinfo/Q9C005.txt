UniprotID	Q9C005
Accession	Q9C005;D6W578
EntryName	DPY30_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein dpy-30 homolog (Dpy-30-like protein) (Dpy-30L)
GeneName	DPY30
Length	99
Function	As part of the MLL1/MLL complex, involved in the methylation of histone H3 at 'Lys-4', particularly trimethylation. Histone H3 'Lys-4' methylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation. May play some role in histone H3 acetylation. In a teratocarcinoma cell, plays a crucial role in retinoic acid-induced differentiation along the neural lineage, regulating gene induction and H3 'Lys-4' methylation at key developmental loci. May also play an indirect or direct role in endosomal transport.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network
