UniprotID	P35221-3
Accession	P35221;Q12795;Q8N1C0
EntryName	CTNA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Catenin alpha-1 (Alpha E-catenin) (Cadherin-associated protein) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-13)
GeneName	CTNNA1
Length	536
Function	Associates with the cytoplasmic domain of a variety of cadherins. The association of catenins to cadherins produces a complex which is linked to the actin filament network, and which seems to be of primary importance for cadherins cell-adhesion properties. Can associate with both E- and N-cadherins. Originally believed to be a stable component of E-cadherin/catenin adhesion complexes and to mediate the linkage of cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton at adherens junctions. In contrast, cortical actin was found to be much more dynamic than E-cadherin/catenin complexes and CTNNA1 was shown not to bind to F-actin when assembled in the complex suggesting a different linkage between actin and adherens junctions components. The homodimeric form may regulate actin filament assembly and inhibit actin branching by competing with the Arp2/3 complex for binding to actin filaments. Involved in the regulation of WWTR1/TAZ, YAP1 and TGFB1-dependent SMAD2 and SMAD3 nuclear accumulation (By similarity). May play a crucial role in cell differentiation.
