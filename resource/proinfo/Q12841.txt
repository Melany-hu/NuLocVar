EntryName	FSTL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Follistatin-related protein 1 (Follistatin-like protein 1)
GeneName	FSTL1 FRP
Length	308
Function	Secreted glycoprotein that is involved in various physiological processes, such as angiogenesis, regulation of the immune response, cell proliferation and differentiation (PubMed:22265692, PubMed:29212066). Plays a role in the development of the central nervous system, skeletal system, lungs, and ureter (By similarity). Promotes endothelial cell survival, migration and differentiation into network structures in an AKT-dependent manner. Also promotes survival of cardiac myocytes (By similarity). Initiates various signaling cascades by activating different receptors on the cell surface such as DIP2A, TLR4 or BMP receptors (PubMed:20054002, PubMed:22265692).
