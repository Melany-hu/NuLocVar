UniprotID	Q13445
Accession	Q13445
EntryName	TMED1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 1 (Interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 ligand) (Putative T1/ST2 receptor-binding protein) (p24 family protein gamma-1) (Tp24) (p24gamma1)
GeneName	TMED1 IL1RL1L IL1RL1LG
Length	227
Function	Potential role in vesicular protein trafficking, mainly in the early secretory pathway. May act as a cargo receptor at the lumenal side for incorporation of secretory cargo molecules into transport vesicles and may be involved in vesicle coat formation at the cytoplasmic side. Plays a positive role in IL-33-mediated IL-8 and IL-6 production by interacting with interleukin-33 receptor IL1RL1 (PubMed:23319592). Also plays a role in the modulation of innate immune signaling through the cGAS-STING pathway by interacting with RNF26 (PubMed:32614325).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus; cis-Golgi network membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane
