UniprotID	Q13077
Accession	Q13077;B4DJ77;Q658U1;Q8NF13
EntryName	TRAF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	TNF receptor-associated factor 1 (Epstein-Barr virus-induced protein 6)
GeneName	TRAF1 EBI6
Length	416
Function	Adapter molecule that regulates the activation of NF-kappa-B and JNK. Plays a role in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis. The heterotrimer formed by TRAF1 and TRAF2 is part of a E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex that promotes ubiquitination of target proteins, such as MAP3K14. The TRAF1/TRAF2 complex recruits the antiapoptotic E3 protein-ubiquitin ligases BIRC2 and BIRC3 to TNFRSF1B/TNFR2.
