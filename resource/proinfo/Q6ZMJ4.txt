Accession	Q6ZMJ4;B2RC28;B2Z4A8;B2ZC70;Q8N6L2
EntryName	IL34_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-34 (IL-34)
GeneName	IL34 C16orf77
Length	242
Function	Cytokine that promotes the proliferation, survival and differentiation of monocytes and macrophages. Promotes the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines, and thereby plays an important role in innate immunity and in inflammatory processes. Plays an important role in the regulation of osteoclast proliferation and differentiation, and in the regulation of bone resorption. Signaling via CSF1R and its downstream effectors stimulates phosphorylation of MAPK1/ERK2 AND MAPK3/ERK1.
