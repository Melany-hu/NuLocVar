UniprotID	P22083
Accession	P22083;B2RMS0
EntryName	FUT4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-(1,3)-fucosyltransferase 4 (4-galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminide 3-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase) (EC 2.4.1.152) (ELAM-1 ligand fucosyltransferase) (Fucosyltransferase 4) (Fucosyltransferase IV) (Fuc-TIV) (FucT-IV) (Galactoside 3-L-fucosyltransferase)
GeneName	FUT4 ELFT FCT3A
Length	530
Function	Catalyzes alpha(1->3) linkage of fucosyl moiety transferred from GDP-beta-L-fucose to N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) within type 2 lactosamine (LacNAc, Gal-beta(1->4)GlcNAc) glycan attached to N- or O-linked glycoproteins (PubMed:1702034, PubMed:1716630, PubMed:29593094). Robustly fucosylates nonsialylated distal LacNAc unit of the polylactosamine chain to form Lewis X antigen (CD15), a glycan determinant known to mediate important cellular functions in development and immunity. Fucosylates with lower efficiency sialylated LacNAc acceptors to form sialyl Lewis X and 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X determinants that serve as recognition epitopes for C-type lectins (PubMed:1716630, PubMed:29593094). Together with FUT7 contributes to SELE, SELL and SELP selectin ligand biosynthesis and selectin-dependent lymphocyte homing, leukocyte migration and blood leukocyte homeostasis (By similarity). In a cell type specific manner, may also fucosylate the internal LacNAc unit of the polylactosamine chain to form VIM-2 antigen that serves as recognition epitope for SELE (PubMed:11278338, PubMed:1716630).
