UniprotID	P68543
Accession	P68543;A8K577;B7ZKP8;Q569G8
EntryName	UBX2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	UBX domain-containing protein 2A (UBX domain-containing protein 4)
GeneName	UBXN2A UBXD4
Length	259
Function	Acts to repress the ubiquitination and subsequent endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of CHRNA3 by the STUB1-VCP-UBXN2A complex in cortical neurons (PubMed:26265139). Also acts to promote the translocation of CHRNA3 to the plasma membrane and subsequently increases plasma membrane acetylcholine-gated ion-channel activation (By similarity). Plays a role in the inhibition of STUB1-mediated TP53 degradation, via its interaction with HSPA9 which acts to inhibit TP53 binding to HSPA9 (PubMed:24625977, PubMed:26634371). Positively mediates the ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of RICTOR, may thereby act as a negative regulator of the mTORC2 pathway (PubMed:37037900).
