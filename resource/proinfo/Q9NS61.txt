EntryName	KCIP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	A-type potassium channel modulatory protein KCNIP2 (Cardiac voltage-gated potassium channel modulatory subunit) (Kv channel-interacting protein 2) (KChIP2) (Potassium channel-interacting protein 2)
GeneName	KCNIP2 KCHIP2
Length	270
Function	Regulatory subunit of Kv4/D (Shal)-type voltage-gated rapidly inactivating A-type potassium channels (PubMed:10676964, PubMed:11287421, PubMed:11684073, PubMed:12297301, PubMed:14623880, PubMed:34997220). Modulates channel density, inactivation kinetics and rate of recovery from inactivation in a calcium-dependent and isoform-specific manner (PubMed:10676964, PubMed:11287421, PubMed:11684073, PubMed:12297301, PubMed:14623880, PubMed:34997220). Involved in KCND2 and KCND3 trafficking to the cell surface (PubMed:12829703). May be required for the expression of I(To) currents in the heart (By similarity).
