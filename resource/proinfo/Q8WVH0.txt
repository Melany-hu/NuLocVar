UniprotID	Q8WVH0
Accession	Q8WVH0;D3DW66;Q8TEM6;Q9H818
EntryName	CPLX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Complexin-3 (Complexin III) (CPX III)
GeneName	CPLX3 Nbla11589
Length	158
Function	Complexin that regulates SNARE protein complex-mediated synaptic vesicle fusion (By similarity). Required for the maintenance of synaptic ultrastructure in the adult retina (By similarity). Positively regulates synaptic transmission through synaptic vesicle availability and exocytosis of neurotransmitters at photoreceptor ribbon synapses in the retina (By similarity). Suppresses tonic photoreceptor activity and baseline 'noise' by suppression of Ca(2+) vesicle tonic release and the facilitation of evoked synchronous and asynchronous Ca(2+) vesicle release (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Synapse; Cell membrane
