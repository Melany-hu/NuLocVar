UniprotID	P17980
Accession	P17980;B2R8V1;Q3B757;Q3B865;Q53HU5;Q6GPG8;Q6IBS1;Q96HD3
EntryName	PRS6A_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome regulatory subunit 6A (26S proteasome AAA-ATPase subunit RPT5) (Proteasome 26S subunit ATPase 3) (Proteasome subunit P50) (Tat-binding protein 1) (TBP-1)
GeneName	PSMC3 TBP1
Length	439
Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair. PSMC3 belongs to the heterohexameric ring of AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) proteins that unfolds ubiquitinated target proteins that are concurrently translocated into a proteolytic chamber and degraded into peptides.
