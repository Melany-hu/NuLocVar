EntryName	ATP6_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP synthase F(0) complex subunit a (F-ATPase protein 6) (Proton-conducting channel, ATP synthase F(0) complex subunit a)
GeneName	MT-ATP6 ATP6 ATPASE6 MTATP6
Length	226
Function	Subunit a, of the mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase complex (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) that produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain (Probable). ATP synthase complex consist of a soluble F(1) head domain - the catalytic core - and a membrane F(1) domain - the membrane proton channel (PubMed:37244256). These two domains are linked by a central stalk rotating inside the F(1) region and a stationary peripheral stalk (PubMed:37244256). During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation (Probable). With the subunit c (ATP5MC1), forms the proton-conducting channel in the F(0) domain, that contains two crucial half-channels (inlet and outlet) that facilitate proton movement from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) into the matrix (PubMed:37244256). Protons are taken up via the inlet half-channel and released through the outlet half-channel, following a Grotthuss mechanism (PubMed:37244256).
