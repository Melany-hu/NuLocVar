UniprotID	Q8IYP9
Accession	Q8IYP9;D3DN76
EntryName	ZDH23_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC23 (EC 2.3.1.225) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 23) (DHHC-23) (zDHHC23)
GeneName	ZDHHC23
Length	409
Function	Palmitoyltransferase that could catalyze the addition of palmitate onto various protein substrates and be involved in a variety of cellular processes (Probable). Palmitoyltransferase that mediates palmitoylation of KCNMA1, regulating localization of KCNMA1 to the plasma membrane. May be involved in NOS1 regulation and targeting to the synaptic membrane.
