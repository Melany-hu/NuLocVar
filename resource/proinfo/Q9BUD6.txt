UniprotID	Q9BUD6
Accession	Q9BUD6;D3DVN9;Q4W5N4;Q9ULW1
EntryName	SPON2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Spondin-2 (Differentially expressed in cancerous and non-cancerous lung cells 1) (DIL-1) (Mindin)
GeneName	SPON2 DIL1 UNQ435/PRO866
Length	331
Function	Cell adhesion protein that promotes adhesion and outgrowth of hippocampal embryonic neurons. Binds directly to bacteria and their components and functions as an opsonin for macrophage phagocytosis of bacteria. Essential in the initiation of the innate immune response and represents a unique pattern-recognition molecule in the ECM for microbial pathogens (By similarity). Binds bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
