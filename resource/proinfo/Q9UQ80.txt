UniprotID	Q9UQ80
Accession	Q9UQ80;O43846;Q9UM59
EntryName	PA2G4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proliferation-associated protein 2G4 (Cell cycle protein p38-2G4 homolog) (hG4-1) (ErbB3-binding protein 1)
GeneName	PA2G4 EBP1
Length	394
Function	May play a role in a ERBB3-regulated signal transduction pathway. Seems be involved in growth regulation. Acts a corepressor of the androgen receptor (AR) and is regulated by the ERBB3 ligand neuregulin-1/heregulin (HRG). Inhibits transcription of some E2F1-regulated promoters, probably by recruiting histone acetylase (HAT) activity. Binds RNA. Associates with 28S, 18S and 5.8S mature rRNAs, several rRNA precursors and probably U3 small nucleolar RNA. May be involved in regulation of intermediate and late steps of rRNA processing. May be involved in ribosome assembly. Mediates cap-independent translation of specific viral IRESs (internal ribosomal entry site) (By similarity). Regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Isoform 1 suppresses apoptosis whereas isoform 2 promotes cell differentiation (By similarity).
