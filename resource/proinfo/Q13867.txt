EntryName	BLMH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bleomycin hydrolase (BH) (BLM hydrolase) (BMH) (EC 3.4.22.40)
GeneName	BLMH
Length	455
Function	The normal physiological role of BLM hydrolase is unknown, but it catalyzes the inactivation of the antitumor drug BLM (a glycopeptide) by hydrolyzing the carboxamide bond of its B-aminoalaninamide moiety thus protecting normal and malignant cells from BLM toxicity.
