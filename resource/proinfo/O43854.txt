UniprotID	O43854
Accession	O43854;B2R763;O43855;Q5D094;Q8N610
EntryName	EDIL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	EGF-like repeat and discoidin I-like domain-containing protein 3 (Developmentally-regulated endothelial cell locus 1 protein) (Integrin-binding protein DEL1)
GeneName	EDIL3 DEL1
Length	480
Function	Promotes adhesion of endothelial cells through interaction with the alpha-v/beta-3 integrin receptor. Inhibits formation of vascular-like structures. May be involved in regulation of vascular morphogenesis of remodeling in embryonic development.
