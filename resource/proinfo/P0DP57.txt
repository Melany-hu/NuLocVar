UniprotID	P0DP57
Accession	P0DP57;D3DWI7;G3XAC2;Q86SR0;Q9BZG9
EntryName	SLUR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Secreted Ly-6/uPAR domain-containing protein 2 (Secreted LY6/PLAUR domain-containing protein 2) (Secreted Ly-6/uPAR-related protein 2) (SLURP-2)
GeneName	SLURP2
Length	97
Function	Binds and may modulate the functional properties of nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. May regulate keratinocytes proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In vitro moderately inhibits ACh-evoked currents of alpha-3:beta-2-containing nAChRs and strongly these of alpha-4:beta-2-containing nAChRs, modulates alpha-7-containing nAChRs, and inhibits nicotine-induced signaling probably implicating alpha-3:beta-4-containing nAChRs. Proposed to act on alpha-3:beta-2 and alpha-7 nAChRs in an orthosteric, and on mAChRs, such as CHRM1 and CHRM3, in an allosteric manner.
