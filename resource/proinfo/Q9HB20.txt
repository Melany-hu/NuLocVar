UniprotID	Q9HB20
Accession	Q9HB20;Q4ZG69;Q86TQ1;Q9NXT3
EntryName	PKHA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family A member 3 (PH domain-containing family A member 3) (Phosphatidylinositol-four-phosphate adapter protein 1) (FAPP-1) (Phosphoinositol 4-phosphate adapter protein 1)
GeneName	PLEKHA3 FAPP1
Length	300
Function	Plays a role in regulation of vesicular cargo transport from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane (PubMed:15107860). Regulates Golgi phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) levels and activates the PtdIns(4)P phosphatase activity of SACM1L when it binds PtdIns(4)P in 'trans' configuration (PubMed:30659099). Binds preferentially to PtdIns(4)P (PubMed:11001876, PubMed:15107860). Negatively regulates APOB secretion from hepatocytes (PubMed:30659099).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane
