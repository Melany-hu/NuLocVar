UniprotID	Q9BW62
Accession	Q9BW62;A8K5X4
EntryName	KATL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Katanin p60 ATPase-containing subunit A-like 1 (Katanin p60 subunit A-like 1) (EC 5.6.1.1) (p60 katanin-like 1)
GeneName	KATNAL1
Length	490
Function	Regulates microtubule dynamics in Sertoli cells, a process that is essential for spermiogenesis and male fertility. Severs microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner, promoting rapid reorganization of cellular microtubule arrays (By similarity). Has microtubule-severing activity in vitro (PubMed:26929214).
