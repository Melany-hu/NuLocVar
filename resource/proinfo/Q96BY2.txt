EntryName	MOAP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Modulator of apoptosis 1 (MAP-1) (MAP1) (Paraneoplastic antigen Ma4)
GeneName	MOAP1 PNMA4
Length	351
Function	Retrotransposon-derived protein that forms virion-like capsids (By similarity). Acts as an effector of BAX during apoptosis: enriched at outer mitochondria membrane and associates with BAX upon induction of apoptosis, facilitating BAX-dependent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and apoptosis (PubMed:11060313, PubMed:16199525). Required for death receptor-dependent apoptosis (PubMed:11060313). When associated with RASSF1, promotes BAX conformational change and translocation to mitochondrial membranes in response to TNF and TNFSF10 stimulation (PubMed:15949439). Also promotes autophagy: promotes phagophore closure via association with ATG8 proteins (PubMed:33783314). Acts as an inhibitor of the NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway via interaction with SQSTM1: interaction promotes dissociation of SQSTM1 inclusion bodies that sequester KEAP1, relieving inactivation of the BCR(KEAP1) complex (PubMed:33393215).
