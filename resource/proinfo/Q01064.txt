UniprotID	Q01064
Accession	Q01064;Q92825;Q96KP3
EntryName	PDE1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity calcium/calmodulin-dependent 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 1B (Cam-PDE 1B) (EC 3.1.4.17) (63 kDa Cam-PDE)
GeneName	PDE1B PDES1B
Length	536
Function	Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase with a dual specificity for the second messengers cAMP and cGMP, which are key regulators of many important physiological processes (PubMed:15260978, PubMed:8855339, PubMed:9419816). Has a preference for cGMP as a substrate (PubMed:9419816).
