UniprotID	Q3I5F7
Accession	Q3I5F7;A0A2R8Y7H3
EntryName	ACOT6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase 6 (Acyl-CoA thioesterase 6) (EC 3.1.2.-)
GeneName	ACOT6 C14orf42
Length	421
Function	Catalyzes the hydrolysis of acyl-CoAs into free fatty acids and coenzyme A (CoASH), regulating their respective intracellular levels. Catalyzes the hydrolysis of phytanoyl-CoA and pristanoyl-CoA, two methyl-branched fatty acids derived from phytol, that enter the body via the diet.
