UniprotID	P01589
Accession	P01589;Q5W007
EntryName	IL2RA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-2 receptor subunit alpha (IL-2 receptor subunit alpha) (IL-2-RA) (IL-2R subunit alpha) (IL2-RA) (TAC antigen) (p55) (CD antigen CD25)
GeneName	IL2RA
Length	272
Function	Receptor for interleukin-2. The receptor is involved in the regulation of immune tolerance by controlling regulatory T cells (TREGs) activity. TREGs suppress the activation and expansion of autoreactive T-cells.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
