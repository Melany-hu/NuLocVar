UniprotID	Q2MJR0
Accession	Q2MJR0;Q2MJR1
EntryName	SPRE3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sprouty-related, EVH1 domain-containing protein 3 (Spred-3)
GeneName	SPRED3 EVE-3
Length	410
Function	Tyrosine kinase substrate that inhibits growth-factor-mediated activation of MAP kinase (By similarity). Inhibits fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-induced retinal lens fiber differentiation, probably by inhibiting FGF-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (By similarity). Inhibits TGFB-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in lens epithelial cells (By similarity).
