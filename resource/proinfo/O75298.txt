UniprotID	O75298
Accession	O75298;O60509;Q7RTM6;Q7RTN1;Q7RTN2
EntryName	RTN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Reticulon-2 (Neuroendocrine-specific protein-like 1) (NSP-like protein 1) (Neuroendocrine-specific protein-like I) (NSP-like protein I) (NSPLI)
GeneName	RTN2 NSPL1
Length	545
Function	Inhibits amyloid precursor protein processing, probably by blocking BACE1 activity (PubMed:15286784). Enhances trafficking of the glutamate transporter SLC1A1/EAAC1 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface (By similarity). Plays a role in the translocation of SLC2A4/GLUT4 from intracellular membranes to the cell membrane which facilitates the uptake of glucose into the cell (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane; Cell membrane; Cell membrane; Sarcolemma; Cell membrane; Sarcolemma; T-tubule; Cytoplasm; Myofibril; Sarcomere; Z line; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
