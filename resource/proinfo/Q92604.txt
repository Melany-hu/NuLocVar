ProteinName	Acyl-CoA:lysophosphatidylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (2-acylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.62) (Acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase LPGAT1) (EC 2.3.1.22) (Lysophospholipid acyltransferase 7) (LPLAT7) (EC 2.3.1.-) (Stearoyl-CoA:1-lyso-2-acyl-PE acyltransferase)
GeneName	LPGAT1 FAM34A KIAA0205
Length	370
Function	Lysophospholipid acyltransferase involved in fatty acyl chain remodeling of glycerophospholipids in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (By similarity). Selectively catalyzes the transfer and esterification of saturated long-chain fatty acids from acyl-CoA to the sn-1 position of 1-lyso-2-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (1-lyso-PE, LPE), with a preference for stearoyl CoA over palmitoyl CoA as acyl donor (PubMed:36049524). Acts in concert with an unknown phospholipase A1 to convert palmitate phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) species into stearate ones. Provides substrates to the PE methylation pathway, controlling stearate/palmitate composition of PE and phosphatidylcholine (PC) species with an overall impact on de novo hepatic lipid synthesis, body fat content and life span (By similarity). Can acylate lysophosphatidylglycerols (LPG) using various saturated fatty acyl-CoAs as acyl donors (PubMed:15485873). Can also acylate monoacylglycerols with a preference for 2-monoacylglycerols over 1-monoacylglycerols (By similarity). Has no activity toward lysophosphatidic acids (LPA) (By similarity).
