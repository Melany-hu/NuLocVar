UniprotID	P20333
Accession	P20333;B1AJZ3;Q16042;Q6YI29;Q9UIH1
EntryName	TNR1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1B (Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2) (TNF-R2) (Tumor necrosis factor receptor type II) (TNF-RII) (TNFR-II) (p75) (p80 TNF-alpha receptor) (CD antigen CD120b) (Etanercept) [Cleaved into: Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 1b, membrane form; Tumor necrosis factor-binding protein 2 (TBP-2) (TBPII)]
GeneName	TNFRSF1B TNFBR TNFR2
Length	461
Function	Receptor with high affinity for TNFSF2/TNF-alpha and approximately 5-fold lower affinity for homotrimeric TNFSF1/lymphotoxin-alpha. The TRAF1/TRAF2 complex recruits the apoptotic suppressors BIRC2 and BIRC3 to TNFRSF1B/TNFR2. This receptor mediates most of the metabolic effects of TNF-alpha. Isoform 2 blocks TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, which suggests that it regulates TNF-alpha function by antagonizing its biological activity.
