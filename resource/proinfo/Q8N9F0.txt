UniprotID	Q8N9F0
Accession	Q8N9F0
EntryName	NAT8L_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-acetylaspartate synthetase (NAA synthetase) (EC 2.3.1.17) (Camello-like protein 3) (N-acetyltransferase 8-like protein)
GeneName	NAT8L CML3
Length	302
Function	Catalyzes the synthesis of N-acetylaspartate acid (NAA) from L-aspartate and acetyl-CoA (PubMed:19524112, PubMed:19807691, PubMed:20385109). Promotes dopamine uptake by regulating TNF-alpha expression (By similarity). Attenuates methamphetamine-induced inhibition of dopamine uptake (PubMed:20385109).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Microsome membrane; Mitochondrion membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
