UniprotID	Q8TC90
Accession	Q8TC90;Q8TC47
EntryName	CCER1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Coiled-coil domain-containing glutamate-rich protein 1
GeneName	CCER1 C12orf12
Length	406
Function	Regulator of histone epigenetic modifications and chromatin compaction into the sperm head, required for histone-to-protamine (HTP) transition. HTP is a key event in which somatic histones are first replaced by testis-specific histone variants, then transition proteins (TNPs) are incorporated into the spermatid nucleus, and finally protamines (PRMs) replace the TNPs to promote chromatin condensation.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
