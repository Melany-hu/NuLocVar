UniprotID	Q8N1S5
Accession	Q8N1S5;B2R8H7;Q8WZ81
EntryName	S39AB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc transporter ZIP11 (Solute carrier family 39 member 11) (Zrt- and Irt-like protein 11) (ZIP-11)
GeneName	SLC39A11 C17orf26 ZIP11
Length	342
Function	Zinc importer that regulates cytosolic zinc concentrations either via zinc influx from the extracellular compartment or efflux from intracellular organelles such as Golgi apparatus. May transport copper ions as well. The transport mechanism remains to be elucidated.
