EntryName	FXL15_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-box/LRR-repeat protein 15 (F-box only protein 37)
GeneName	FBXL15 FBXO37
Length	300
Function	Substrate recognition component of a SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of SMURF1, thereby acting as a positive regulator of the BMP signaling pathway. Required for dorsal/ventral pattern formation and bone mass maintenance. Also mediates ubiquitination of SMURF2 and WWP2.
