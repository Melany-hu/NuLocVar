UniprotID	Q8IWE4
Accession	Q8IWE4;B3KVY4
EntryName	DCNL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	DCN1-like protein 3 (DCNL3) (DCUN1 domain-containing protein 3) (Defective in cullin neddylation protein 1-like protein 3) (Squamous cell carcinoma-related oncogene 3)
GeneName	DCUN1D3 SCCRO3
Length	304
Function	Contributes to the neddylation of all cullins by transferring NEDD8 from N-terminally acetylated NEDD8-conjugating E2s enzyme to different cullin C-terminal domain-RBX complexes and may play a role in the cell cycle progression by regulating the SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, after UV damage (PubMed:18823379, PubMed:19617556, PubMed:23201271, PubMed:27542266). At the cell membrane, can promote and as well inhibit cullins neddylation (PubMed:19617556, PubMed:25349211, PubMed:26906416).
