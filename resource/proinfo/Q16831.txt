UniprotID	Q16831
Accession	Q16831;D3DVM4;Q15362
EntryName	UPP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Uridine phosphorylase 1 (UPase 1) (UrdPase 1) (EC 2.4.2.3)
GeneName	UPP1 UP
Length	310
Function	Catalyzes the reversible phosphorylytic cleavage of uridine to uracil and ribose-1-phosphate which can then be utilized as carbon and energy sources or in the rescue of pyrimidine bases for nucleotide synthesis (PubMed:7488099). Shows broad substrate specificity and can also accept deoxyuridine and other analogous compounds (Probable).
