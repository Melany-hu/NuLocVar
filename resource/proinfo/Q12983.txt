UniprotID	Q12983
Accession	Q12983;O14620;Q96GP0
EntryName	BNIP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3
GeneName	BNIP3 NIP3
Length	194
Function	Apoptosis-inducing protein that can overcome BCL2 suppression. May play a role in repartitioning calcium between the two major intracellular calcium stores in association with BCL2. Involved in mitochondrial quality control via its interaction with SPATA18/MIEAP: in response to mitochondrial damage, participates in mitochondrial protein catabolic process (also named MALM) leading to the degradation of damaged proteins inside mitochondria. The physical interaction of SPATA18/MIEAP, BNIP3 and BNIP3L/NIX at the mitochondrial outer membrane regulates the opening of a pore in the mitochondrial double membrane in order to mediate the translocation of lysosomal proteins from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix. Plays an important role in the calprotectin (S100A8/A9)-induced cell death pathway.
