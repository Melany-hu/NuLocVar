UniprotID	Q92858
Accession	Q92858;Q14CT9
EntryName	ATOH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor ATOH1 (Atonal bHLH transcription factor 1) (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 14) (bHLHa14) (Helix-loop-helix protein hATH-1) (hATH1) (Protein atonal homolog 1)
GeneName	ATOH1 ATH1 BHLHA14
Length	354
Function	Transcriptional regulator. Activates E box-dependent transcription in collaboration with TCF3/E47, but the activity is completely antagonized by the negative regulator of neurogenesis HES1. Plays a role in the differentiation of subsets of neural cells by activating E box-dependent transcription (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
