UniprotID	Q7LGC8
Accession	Q7LGC8;O75099;Q52M30
EntryName	CHST3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 3 (EC 2.8.2.17) (EC 2.8.2.21) (Chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase 1) (C6ST-1) (Chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase) (C6ST) (Galactose/N-acetylglucosamine/N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase 0) (GST-0)
GeneName	CHST3
Length	479
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) as sulfonate donor to catalyze the transfer of sulfate to position 6 of the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue of chondroitin (PubMed:15215498, PubMed:9714738, PubMed:9883891). Chondroitin sulfate constitutes the predominant proteoglycan present in cartilage and is distributed on the surfaces of many cells and extracellular matrices (PubMed:9714738). Catalyzes with a lower efficiency the sulfation of Gal residues of keratan sulfate, another glycosaminoglycan (PubMed:9714738). Can also catalyze the sulfation of the Gal residues in sialyl N-acetyllactosamine (sialyl LacNAc) oligosaccharides (By similarity). May play a role in the maintenance of naive T-lymphocytes in the spleen (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
