EntryName	FUT5_HUMAN
ProteinName	4-galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminide 3-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase FUT5 (EC 2.4.1.152) (3-galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminide 4-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase FUT5) (EC 2.4.1.65) (Fucosyltransferase 5) (Fucosyltransferase V) (Fuc-TV) (FucT-V) (Galactoside 3-L-fucosyltransferase)
GeneName	FUT5
Length	374
Function	Catalyzes preferentially the transfer of L-fucose, from a guanosine diphosphate-beta-L-fucose, to the N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) of an N-acetyllactosamine unit (type 2 chain) of an oligosaccharide, or a glycoprotein- and a glycolipid-linked N-acetyllactosamine unit via an alpha (1,3) linkage and participates in the surface expression of VIM-2, Lewis X/SSEA-1 and sialyl Lewis X antigens (PubMed:14718375, PubMed:1740457, PubMed:17604274, PubMed:29593094, PubMed:7721776, PubMed:9737988, PubMed:9737989). Preferentially transfers fucose to the GlcNAc of an internal N-acetyllactosamine unit of a poly-N-acetyllactosamine chain acceptor substrate (PubMed:17604274, PubMed:7721776). Also catalyzes to a lesser extend the transfer of L-fucose to the GlcNAc of a type 1 (beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl) or H-type 1 (alpha-L-Fuc-(1->2)-beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-D-GlcNAc) chain oligosaccharide via an alpha (1,4) linkage (PubMed:14718375, PubMed:1740457, PubMed:17604274, PubMed:7721776, PubMed:9737988). Preferentially catalyzes sialylated type 2 oligosaccharide acceptors over neutral type 2 or H type 2 (alpha-L-Fuc-(1->2)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-GlcNAc) oligosaccharide acceptors (PubMed:1740457, PubMed:9737989). Lactose-based structures are also acceptor substrates (PubMed:1740457, PubMed:7721776).
