UniprotID	Q13636
Accession	Q13636;B2RBT7;Q15770;Q9HC00
EntryName	RAB31_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-31 (EC 3.6.5.2) (Ras-related protein Rab-22B)
GeneName	RAB31 RAB22B
Length	195
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes (PubMed:11784320). Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different set of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion. Required for the integrity and for normal function of the Golgi apparatus and the trans-Golgi network. Plays a role in insulin-stimulated translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane. Plays a role in M6PR transport from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes. Plays a role in the internalization of EGFR from the cell membrane into endosomes. Plays a role in the maturation of phagosomes that engulf pathogens, such as S.aureus and M.tuberculosis.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane; Early endosome; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Phagosome; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Phagosome membrane
