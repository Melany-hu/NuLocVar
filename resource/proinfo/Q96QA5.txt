UniprotID	Q96QA5
Accession	Q96QA5;Q32MC5;Q86VE7;Q8N1M6
EntryName	GSDMA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gasdermin-A (Gasdermin-1) [Cleaved into: Gasdermin-A, N-terminal (GSDMA-NT); Gasdermin-A, C-terminal (GSDMA-CT)]
GeneName	GSDMA GSDM GSDM1 FKSG9
Length	445
Function	This form constitutes the precursor of the pore-forming protein and acts as a sensor of infection: upon infection by S.pyogenes, specifically cleaved by S.pyogenes effector protein SpeB in epithelial cells, releasing the N-terminal moiety (Gasdermin-A, N-terminal) that binds to membranes and forms pores, triggering pyroptosis.
