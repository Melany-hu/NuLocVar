UniprotID	Q8IZU3
Accession	Q8IZU3
EntryName	SYCP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP-3)
GeneName	SYCP3 SCP3
Length	236
Function	Component of the synaptonemal complexes (SCS), formed between homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase. Required for centromere pairing during meiosis in male germ cells (By similarity). Required for normal meiosis during spermatogenesis and male fertility (PubMed:14643120). Plays a lesser role in female fertility. Required for efficient phosphorylation of HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 (By similarity).
