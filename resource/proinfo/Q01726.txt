EntryName	MSHR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor (MSH-R) (Melanocortin receptor 1) (MC1-R)
GeneName	MC1R MSHR
Length	317
Function	Receptor for MSH (alpha, beta and gamma) and ACTH (PubMed:11442765, PubMed:11707265, PubMed:1325670, PubMed:1516719, PubMed:8463333). The activity of this receptor is mediated by G proteins which activate adenylate cyclase (PubMed:11707265, PubMed:1325670, PubMed:16463023, PubMed:19737927). Mediates melanogenesis, the production of eumelanin (black/brown) and phaeomelanin (red/yellow), via regulation of cAMP signaling in melanocytes (PubMed:31097585).
