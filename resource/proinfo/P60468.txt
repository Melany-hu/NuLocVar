UniprotID	P60468
Accession	P60468;P38390;P38391;Q6IBC1
EntryName	SC61B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein transport protein Sec61 subunit beta
GeneName	SEC61B
Length	96
Function	Component of SEC61 channel-forming translocon complex that mediates transport of signal peptide-containing precursor polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (PubMed:12475939). Forms a ribosome receptor and a gated pore in the ER membrane, both functions required for cotranslational translocation of nascent polypeptides (PubMed:12475939). The SEC61 channel is also involved in ER membrane insertion of transmembrane proteins: it mediates membrane insertion of the first few transmembrane segments of proteins, while insertion of subsequent transmembrane regions of multi-pass membrane proteins is mediated by the multi-pass translocon (MPT) complex (PubMed:32820719, PubMed:36261522). The SEC61 channel cooperates with the translocating protein TRAM1 to import nascent proteins into the ER (PubMed:19121997).
