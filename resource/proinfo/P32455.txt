ProteinName	Guanylate-binding protein 1 (EC 3.6.1.-) (EC 3.6.5.-) (GTP-binding protein 1) (GBP-1) (HuGBP-1) (hGBP1) (Guanine nucleotide-binding protein 1) (Interferon-induced guanylate-binding protein 1)
GeneName	GBP1
Length	592
Function	Interferon (IFN)-inducible GTPase that plays important roles in innate immunity against a diverse range of bacterial, viral and protozoan pathogens (PubMed:16511497, PubMed:22106366, PubMed:29144452, PubMed:31268602, PubMed:32510692, PubMed:32581219, PubMed:37797010, PubMed:7512561). Hydrolyzes GTP to GMP in two consecutive cleavage reactions: GTP is first hydrolyzed to GDP and then to GMP in a processive manner (PubMed:16511497, PubMed:32510692, PubMed:7512561). Following infection, recruited to the pathogen-containing vacuoles or vacuole-escaped bacteria and promotes both inflammasome assembly and autophagy (PubMed:29144452, PubMed:31268602). Acts as a positive regulator of inflammasome assembly by facilitating the detection of inflammasome ligands from pathogens (PubMed:31268602, PubMed:32510692, PubMed:32581219). Involved in the lysis of pathogen-containing vacuoles, releasing pathogens into the cytosol (By similarity). Following pathogen release in the cytosol, forms a protein coat in a GTPase-dependent manner that encapsulates pathogens and promotes the detection of ligands by pattern recognition receptors (PubMed:32510692, PubMed:32581219). Plays a key role in inflammasome assembly in response to infection by Gram-negative bacteria: following pathogen release in the cytosol, forms a protein coat that encapsulates Gram-negative bacteria and directly binds to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), disrupting the O-antigen barrier and unmasking lipid A that is that detected by the non-canonical inflammasome effector CASP4/CASP11 (PubMed:32510692, PubMed:32581219). Also promotes recruitment of proteins that mediate bacterial cytolysis, leading to release double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that activates the AIM2 inflammasome (PubMed:31268602). Involved in autophagy by regulating bacteriolytic peptide generation via its interaction with ubiquitin-binding protein SQSTM1, which delivers monoubiquitinated proteins to autolysosomes for the generation of bacteriolytic peptides (By similarity). Confers protection to several pathogens, including the bacterial pathogens L.monocytogenes and M.bovis BCG as well as the protozoan pathogen T.gondii (PubMed:31268602). Exhibits antiviral activity against influenza virus (PubMed:22106366).
