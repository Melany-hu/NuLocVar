UniprotID	Q9H910
Accession	Q9H910;B1AJY2;B4DLH4;Q6EIC7
EntryName	JUPI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Jupiter microtubule associated homolog 2 (Hematological and neurological expressed 1-like protein) (HN1-like protein)
GeneName	JPT2 C16orf34 HN1L L11
Length	190
Function	Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) binding protein required for NAADP-evoked intracellular calcium release (PubMed:33758061, PubMed:33758062). Confers NAADP-sensitivity to the two pore channels (TPCs) complex (PubMed:33758061). Enables NAADP to activate Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors (PubMed:33758062).
