UniprotID	Q9BZM2
Accession	Q9BZM2;Q5R385;Q8N217;Q9H506
EntryName	PA2GF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Group IIF secretory phospholipase A2 (GIIF sPLA2) (sPLA2-IIF) (EC 3.1.1.4) (Phosphatidylcholine 2-acylhydrolase 2F)
GeneName	PLA2G2F
Length	168
Function	Secretory calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 that primarily targets extracellular phospholipids. Hydrolyzes the ester bond of the fatty acyl group attached at the sn-2 position of phospholipids (phospholipase A2 activity), the catalytic efficiency decreasing in the following order: phosphatidylglycerols > phosphatidylethanolamines > phosphatidylcholines > phosphatidylserines (PubMed:11112443). May play a role in lipid mediator production in inflammatory conditions, by providing arachidonic acid to downstream cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases (By similarity).
