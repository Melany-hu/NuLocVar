UniprotID	Q8TAE8
Accession	Q8TAE8;Q8IVM3;Q8TE51;Q969P9;Q9BSM6
EntryName	G45IP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein mL64 (39S ribosomal protein L59, mitochondrial) (MRP-L59) (CKII beta-associating protein) (CR6-interacting factor 1) (CRIF1) (Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible proteins-interacting protein 1) (Papillomavirus L2-interacting nuclear protein 1) (PLINP) (PLINP-1) (p53-responsive gene 6 protein)
GeneName	GADD45GIP1 MRPL59 PLINP1 PRG6
Length	222
Function	Acts as a negative regulator of G1 to S cell cycle phase progression by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases. Inhibitory effects are additive with GADD45 proteins but also occur in the absence of GADD45 proteins. Acts as a repressor of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A1 by inhibiting AB domain-mediated transcriptional activity. May be involved in the hormone-mediated regulation of NR4A1 transcriptional activity. May play a role in mitochondrial protein synthesis.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion; Nucleus
