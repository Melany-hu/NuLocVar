UniprotID	Q9Y624
Accession	Q9Y624;B7Z941
EntryName	JAM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) (Junctional adhesion molecule 1) (JAM-1) (Platelet F11 receptor) (Platelet adhesion molecule 1) (PAM-1) (CD antigen CD321)
GeneName	F11R JAM1 JCAM UNQ264/PRO301
Length	299
Function	Seems to play a role in epithelial tight junction formation. Appears early in primordial forms of cell junctions and recruits PARD3 (PubMed:11489913). The association of the PARD6-PARD3 complex may prevent the interaction of PARD3 with JAM1, thereby preventing tight junction assembly (By similarity). Plays a role in regulating monocyte transmigration involved in integrity of epithelial barrier (By similarity). Ligand for integrin alpha-L/beta-2 involved in memory T-cell and neutrophil transmigration (PubMed:11812992). Involved in platelet activation (PubMed:10753840).
Subcellular Location	Cell junction; Tight junction; Cell membrane
