UniprotID	P17735
Accession	P17735;B2R8I1;D3DWS2
EntryName	ATTY_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) (EC 2.6.1.5) (L-tyrosine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase)
GeneName	TAT
Length	454
Function	Transaminase involved in tyrosine breakdown. Converts tyrosine to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. Can catalyze the reverse reaction, using glutamic acid, with 2-oxoglutarate as cosubstrate (in vitro). Has much lower affinity and transaminase activity towards phenylalanine.
