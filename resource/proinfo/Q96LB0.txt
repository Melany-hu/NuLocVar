UniprotID	Q96LB0
Accession	Q96LB0;B0M0L1;Q8TDE0;Q8TDE1
EntryName	MRGX3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor member X3 (Sensory neuron-specific G-protein coupled receptor 1/2)
GeneName	MRGPRX3 MRGX3 SNSR1 SNSR2
Length	322
Function	Orphan receptor. Probably involved in the function of nociceptive neurons. May regulate nociceptor function and/or development, including the sensation or modulation of pain. Potently activated by enkephalins (By similarity).
