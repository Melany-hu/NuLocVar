UniprotID	Q9UJK0
Accession	Q9UJK0;Q6PJT8
EntryName	TSR3_HUMAN
ProteinName	18S rRNA aminocarboxypropyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.157) (20S S rRNA accumulation protein 3 homolog) (HsTsr3)
GeneName	TSR3 C16orf42 UND313L
Length	312
Function	Aminocarboxypropyltransferase that catalyzes the aminocarboxypropyl transfer on pseudouridine at position 1248 (Psi1248) in 18S rRNA (Probable). It constitutes the last step in biosynthesis of the hypermodified N1-methyl-N3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) pseudouridine (m1acp3-Psi) conserved in eukaryotic 18S rRNA (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
