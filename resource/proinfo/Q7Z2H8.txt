UniprotID	Q7Z2H8
Accession	Q7Z2H8;C9JI34;Q1LZ56;Q7Z7C0;Q86YK4;Q96M74
EntryName	S36A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proton-coupled amino acid transporter 1 (Proton/amino acid transporter 1) (hPAT1) (Solute carrier family 36 member 1)
GeneName	SLC36A1 PAT1
Length	476
Function	Electrogenic proton/amino acid symporter with selectivity for small apolar L-amino acids, their D-enantiomers and selected amino acid derivatives such as 4-aminobutanoate/GABA (PubMed:12527723, PubMed:12809675, PubMed:19549785). May be involved in the efflux from the lysosomal compartment of neutral amino acids resulting from proteolysis (By similarity). May play a role in specifying sites for exocytosis in neurons (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Apical cell membrane; Lysosome membrane
