UniprotID	Q86UW8
Accession	Q86UW8;A5PKW5;Q96PW2
EntryName	HPLN4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 4 (Brain link protein 2)
GeneName	HAPLN4 BRAL2 KIAA1926
Length	402
Function	Essential for the proper localization of brevican (BCAN), mainly as a perineuronal nets (PNNs)-type deposition in the brainstem and cerebellum thereby playing a key role in the formation and structural organization of PNNs (By similarity). Contributes to the formation and transmission of inhibitory GABAergic synapses between Purkinje cells and deep cerebellar nuclei neurons (By similarity).
