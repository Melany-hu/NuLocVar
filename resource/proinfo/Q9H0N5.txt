UniprotID	Q9H0N5
Accession	Q9H0N5;Q8TD40
EntryName	PHS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pterin-4-alpha-carbinolamine dehydratase 2 (PHS 2) (EC 4.2.1.96) (4-alpha-hydroxy-tetrahydropterin dehydratase 2) (DcoH-like protein DCoHm) (Dimerization cofactor of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 from muscle) (HNF-1-alpha dimerization cofactor)
GeneName	PCBD2 DCOH2 DCOHM
Length	130
Function	Involved in tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis. Seems to both prevent the formation of 7-pterins and accelerate the formation of quinonoid-BH2 (By similarity).
