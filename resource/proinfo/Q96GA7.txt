UniprotID	Q96GA7
Accession	Q96GA7
EntryName	SDSL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine dehydratase-like (Cancerous serine dehydratase) (cSDH) (Glutamate racemase) (EC 5.1.1.3) (L-serine deaminase) (EC 4.3.1.17) (L-serine dehydratase/L-threonine deaminase) (SDHL) (L-threonine dehydratase) (TDH) (EC 4.3.1.19) (Serine dehydratase 2) (SDH 2)
GeneName	SDSL
Length	329
Function	Catalyzes the pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent dehydrative deamination of L-threonine and L-serine to ammonia and alpha-ketobutyrate and pyruvate, respectively (PubMed:16580895, PubMed:18342636). Also exhibits racemase activity towards L-glutamate and D-glutamate (By similarity).
