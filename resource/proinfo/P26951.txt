UniprotID	P26951
Accession	P26951;A8K3F3;B9VI81;Q5HYQ7;Q5HYQ8;Q9UEH7
EntryName	IL3RA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-3 receptor subunit alpha (IL-3 receptor subunit alpha) (IL-3R subunit alpha) (IL-3R-alpha) (IL-3RA) (CD antigen CD123)
GeneName	IL3RA IL3R
Length	378
Function	Cell surface receptor for IL3 expressed on hematopoietic progenitor cells, monocytes and B-lymphocytes that controls the production and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into lineage-restricted cells (PubMed:10527461). Ligand stimulation rapidly induces hetrodimerization with IL3RB, phosphorylation and enzyme activity of effector proteins such as JAK2 and PI3K that play a role in signaling cell proliferation and differentiation. Activation of JAK2 leads to STAT5-mediated transcriptional program (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
