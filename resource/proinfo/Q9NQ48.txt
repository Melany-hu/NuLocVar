UniprotID	Q9NQ48
Accession	Q9NQ48;B3KSI9;B4E0K7;Q8TC61;Q9NQ56
EntryName	LZTL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leucine zipper transcription factor-like protein 1
GeneName	LZTFL1
Length	299
Function	Regulates ciliary localization of the BBSome complex. Together with the BBSome complex, controls SMO ciliary trafficking and contributes to the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway regulation. May play a role in neurite outgrowth. May have tumor suppressor function.
