Accession	P56746;B3KPB5
EntryName	CLD15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Claudin-15
GeneName	CLDN15
Length	228
Function	Forms paracellular channels: polymerizes in tight junction strands with cation- and water-selective channels through the strands, conveying epithelial permeability in a process known as paracellular tight junction permeability (PubMed:12055082, PubMed:13129853, PubMed:31188544, PubMed:35650657, PubMed:36008380). In intestinal epithelium, allows for sodium and water fluxes from the peritoneal side to the lumen of the intestine to regulate nutrient absorption and intestinal morphogenesis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell junction; Tight junction; Cell membrane
