UniprotID	A6NIH7
Accession	A6NIH7
EntryName	U119B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein unc-119 homolog B
GeneName	UNC119B
Length	251
Function	Myristoyl-binding protein that acts as a cargo adapter: specifically binds the myristoyl moiety of a subset of N-terminally myristoylated proteins and is required for their localization. Binds myristoylated NPHP3 and plays a key role in localization of NPHP3 to the primary cilium membrane. Does not bind all myristoylated proteins. Probably plays a role in trafficking proteins in photoreceptor cells.
Subcellular Location	Cell projection; Cilium
