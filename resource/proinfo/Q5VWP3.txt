EntryName	MLIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Muscular LMNA-interacting protein (Cardiac Isl1-interacting protein) (CIP) (Muscular-enriched A-type laminin-interacting protein)
GeneName	MLIP C6orf142 Cip
Length	993
Function	Required for myoblast differentiation into myotubes, possibly acting as a transcriptional regulator of the myogenic program (By similarity). Required for cardiac adaptation to stress through integrated regulation of the AKT/mTOR pathways and FOXO1. Regulates cardiac homeostasis and plays a role in the protection against cardiac hypertrophy (By similarity). Binds chromatin (By similarity). May act as a transcriptional cofactor for ISL1, repressing its transcriptional activity (By similarity). May also repress MYOCD transcriptional activity (By similarity).
