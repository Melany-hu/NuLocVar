Accession	P03901
EntryName	NU4LM_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4L (EC 7.1.1.2) (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4L) (ND4L)
GeneName	MT-ND4L MTND4L NADH4L ND4L
Length	98
Function	Core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) which catalyzes electron transfer from NADH through the respiratory chain, using ubiquinone as an electron acceptor (PubMed:28844695). Part of the enzyme membrane arm which is embedded in the lipid bilayer and involved in proton translocation (PubMed:28844695).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
