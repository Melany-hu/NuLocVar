EntryName	CRLF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (Cytokine receptor-like 2) (IL-XR) (Thymic stromal lymphopoietin protein receptor) (TSLP receptor)
GeneName	CRLF2 CRL2 ILXR TSLPR
Length	371
Function	Receptor for thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Forms a functional complex with TSLP and IL7R which is capable of stimulating cell proliferation through activation of STAT3 and STAT5. Also activates JAK2 (By similarity). Implicated in the development of the hematopoietic system.
