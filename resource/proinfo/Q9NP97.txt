UniprotID	Q9NP97
Accession	Q9NP97;B1AKR5;Q5TC72;Q96IV3;Q9NQM2
EntryName	DLRB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynein light chain roadblock-type 1 (Bithoraxoid-like protein) (BLP) (Dynein light chain 2A, cytoplasmic) (Dynein-associated protein Km23) (Roadblock domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	DYNLRB1 BITH DNCL2A DNLC2A ROBLD1 HSPC162
Length	96
Function	Acts as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 1 complex that are thought to be involved in linking dynein to cargos and to adapter proteins that regulate dynein function. Cytoplasmic dynein 1 acts as a motor for the intracellular retrograde motility of vesicles and organelles along microtubules.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
