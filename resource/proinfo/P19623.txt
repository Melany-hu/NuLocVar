UniprotID	P19623
Accession	P19623;B1AKP9;Q15511
EntryName	SPEE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Spermidine synthase (SPDSY) (EC 2.5.1.16) (Putrescine aminopropyltransferase)
GeneName	SRM SPS1 SRML1
Length	302
Function	Catalyzes the production of spermidine from putrescine and decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM). Has a strong preference for putrescine as substrate, and has very low activity towards 1,3-diaminopropane. Has extremely low activity towards spermidine.
