UniprotID	Q8NDZ6
Accession	Q8NDZ6;Q5CZH7;Q6UWQ6
EntryName	T161B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 161B
GeneName	TMEM161B UNQ679/PRO1313
Length	487
Function	Essential for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm in the developing heart and for neonatal survival (By similarity). Inhibits potassium and calcium currents in the cardiomyocytes, this assists in timely action potential repolarization and thereby maintains normal cardiac rhythm (By similarity).
