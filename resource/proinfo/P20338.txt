UniprotID	P20338
Accession	P20338;Q5T7P7;Q9BQ44
EntryName	RAB4A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-4A (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB4A RAB4
Length	218
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (PubMed:15907487, PubMed:16034420). RAB4A is involved in protein transport (PubMed:29425100). Also plays a role in vesicular traffic. Mediates VEGFR2 endosomal trafficking to enhance VEGFR2 signaling (PubMed:29425100). Acts as a regulator of platelet alpha-granule release during activation and aggregation of platelets (By similarity).
