EntryName	TNR6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 6 (Apo-1 antigen) (Apoptosis-mediating surface antigen FAS) (FASLG receptor) (CD antigen CD95)
GeneName	FAS APT1 FAS1 TNFRSF6
Length	335
Function	Receptor for TNFSF6/FASLG. The adapter molecule FADD recruits caspase CASP8 to the activated receptor. The resulting death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) performs CASP8 proteolytic activation which initiates the subsequent cascade of caspases (aspartate-specific cysteine proteases) mediating apoptosis. FAS-mediated apoptosis may have a role in the induction of peripheral tolerance, in the antigen-stimulated suicide of mature T-cells, or both. The secreted isoforms 2 to 6 block apoptosis (in vitro).
