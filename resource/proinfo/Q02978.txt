EntryName	M2OM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate/malate carrier protein (OGCP) (alpha-oxoglutarate carrier) (Solute carrier family 25 member 11) (SLC25A11)
GeneName	SLC25A11 SLC20A4
Length	314
Function	Catalyzes the transport of 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-oxoglutarate) across the inner mitochondrial membrane in an electroneutral exchange for malate. Can also exchange 2-oxoglutarate for other dicarboxylic acids such as malonate, succinate, maleate and oxaloacetate, although with lower affinity. Contributes to several metabolic processes, including the malate-aspartate shuttle, the oxoglutarate/isocitrate shuttle, in gluconeogenesis from lactate, and in nitrogen metabolism (By similarity). Maintains mitochondrial fusion and fission events, and the organization and morphology of cristae (PubMed:21448454). Involved in the regulation of apoptosis (By similarity). Helps protect from cytotoxic-induced apoptosis by modulating glutathione levels in mitochondria (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
