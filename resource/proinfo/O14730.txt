UniprotID	O14730
Accession	O14730;Q8IXN9
EntryName	RIOK3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase RIO3 (EC 2.7.11.1) (RIO kinase 3) (sudD homolog)
GeneName	RIOK3 SUDD
Length	519
Function	Involved in regulation of type I interferon (IFN)-dependent immune response which plays a critical role in the innate immune response against DNA and RNA viruses. May act as an adapter protein essential for the recruitment of TBK1 to IRF3 (PubMed:24807708). Phosphorylates IFIH1 on 'Ser-828' interfering with IFIH1 filament assembly on long dsRNA and resulting in attenuated IFIH1-signaling (PubMed:25865883). Can inhibit CASP10 isoform 7-mediated activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway (PubMed:19557502). May play a role in the biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Involved in the processing of 21S pre-rRNA to the mature 18S rRNA (PubMed:22418843).
