UniprotID	P29083
Accession	P29083;Q16103
EntryName	T2EA_HUMAN
ProteinName	General transcription factor IIE subunit 1 (General transcription factor IIE 56 kDa subunit) (Transcription initiation factor IIE subunit alpha) (TFIIE-alpha)
GeneName	GTF2E1 TF2E1
Length	439
Function	Recruits TFIIH to the initiation complex and stimulates the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase and DNA-dependent ATPase activities of TFIIH. Both TFIIH and TFIIE are required for promoter clearance by RNA polymerase.
