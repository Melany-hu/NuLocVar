UniprotID	Q8WU20
Accession	Q8WU20;B0LPF2;B2R684;O43558;Q7LDQ6
EntryName	FRS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FGFR substrate 2) (FGFR-signaling adaptor SNT) (Suc1-associated neurotrophic factor target 1) (SNT-1)
GeneName	FRS2
Length	508
Function	Adapter protein that links activated FGR and NGF receptors to downstream signaling pathways. Plays an important role in the activation of MAP kinases and in the phosphorylation of PIK3R1, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, in response to ligand-mediated activation of FGFR1. Modulates signaling via SHC1 by competing for a common binding site on NTRK1.
Subcellular Location	Endomembrane system
