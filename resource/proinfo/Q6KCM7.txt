EntryName	SCMC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial adenyl nucleotide antiporter SLC25A25 (Mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi carrier protein 3) (Mitochondrial Ca(2+)-dependent solute carrier protein 3) (Short calcium-binding mitochondrial carrier protein 2) (SCaMC-2) (Solute carrier family 25 member 25)
GeneName	SLC25A25 APC3 KIAA1896 MCSC3 SCAMC2 UNQ549/PRO1106
Length	469
Function	Electroneutral antiporter that most probably mediates the transport of adenyl nucleotides through the inner mitochondrial membrane. Originally identified as an ATP-magnesium/inorganic phosphate antiporter, it could have a broader specificity for adenyl nucleotides. By regulating the mitochondrial matrix adenyl nucleotide pool could adapt to changing cellular energetic demands and indirectly regulate adenyl nucleotide-dependent metabolic pathways.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
