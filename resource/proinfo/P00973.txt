EntryName	OAS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthase 1 ((2-5')oligo(A) synthase 1) (2-5A synthase 1) (EC 2.7.7.84) (E18/E16) (p46/p42 OAS)
GeneName	OAS1 OIAS
Length	400
Function	Interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated antiviral enzyme which plays a critical role in cellular innate antiviral response (PubMed:34581622). In addition, it may also play a role in other cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell growth, differentiation and gene regulation. Synthesizes higher oligomers of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP which then bind to the inactive monomeric form of ribonuclease L (RNase L) leading to its dimerization and subsequent activation. Activation of RNase L leads to degradation of cellular as well as viral RNA, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis, thus terminating viral replication (PubMed:34145065, PubMed:34581622). Can mediate the antiviral effect via the classical RNase L-dependent pathway or an alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNase L. The secreted form displays antiviral effect against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and stimulates the alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNase L.
