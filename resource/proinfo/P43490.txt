UniprotID	P43490
Accession	P43490;A4D0Q9;A4D0R0;Q3KQV0;Q8WW95
EntryName	NAMPT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAmPRTase) (Nampt) (EC 2.4.2.12) (Pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor 1) (Pre-B cell-enhancing factor) (Visfatin)
GeneName	NAMPT PBEF PBEF1
Length	491
Function	Catalyzes the condensation of nicotinamide with 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate to yield nicotinamide mononucleotide, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of NAD. It is the rate limiting component in the mammalian NAD biosynthesis pathway. The secreted form behaves both as a cytokine with immunomodulating properties and an adipokine with anti-diabetic properties, it has no enzymatic activity, partly because of lack of activation by ATP, which has a low level in extracellular space and plasma. Plays a role in the modulation of circadian clock function. NAMPT-dependent oscillatory production of NAD regulates oscillation of clock target gene expression by releasing the core clock component: CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer from NAD-dependent SIRT1-mediated suppression (By similarity).
