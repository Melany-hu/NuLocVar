UniprotID	Q9H4X1
Accession	Q9H4X1;Q6NZ48;Q9UL69
EntryName	RGCC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Regulator of cell cycle RGCC (Response gene to complement 32 protein) (RGC-32)
GeneName	RGCC C13orf15 RGC32
Length	137
Function	Modulates the activity of cell cycle-specific kinases. Enhances CDK1 activity. May contribute to the regulation of the cell cycle. May inhibit growth of glioma cells by promoting arrest of mitotic progression at the G2/M transition. Fibrogenic factor contributing to the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis through fibroblast activation.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome
