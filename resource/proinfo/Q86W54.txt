UniprotID	Q86W54
Accession	Q86W54
EntryName	SPA24_HUMAN
ProteinName	Spermatogenesis-associated protein 24 (Testis protein T6441 homolog)
GeneName	SPATA24
Length	205
Function	Binds DNA with high affinity but does not bind to TATA boxes. Synergises with GMNN and TBP in activation of TATA box-containing promoters and with GMNN and TBPL1 in activation of the NF1 TATA-less promoter. May play a role in cytoplasm movement and removal during spermiogenesis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Nucleus; Nucleolus; Nucleus; Nucleoplasm
