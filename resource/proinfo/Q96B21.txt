UniprotID	Q96B21
Accession	Q96B21;A8K2L8
EntryName	TM45B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 45B
GeneName	TMEM45B
Length	275
Function	Plays a role in innate immunity (PubMed:35938871). Mechanistically, promotes alphaviruses RNA degradation by interacting with the viral polymerase nsP4 and the mRNA-capping enzyme nsP1 and thereby interfering with the interaction between viral RNA and nsP1 (PubMed:35938871).
Subcellular Location	Endosome membrane; Lysosome membrane; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane
