EntryName	PRR5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proline-rich protein 5 (Protein observed with Rictor-1) (Protor-1)
GeneName	PRR5 PROTOR1 PP610
Length	388
Function	Associated subunit of mTORC2, which regulates cell growth and survival in response to hormonal signals (PubMed:17461779, PubMed:17599906, PubMed:29424687). mTORC2 is activated by growth factors, but, in contrast to mTORC1, seems to be nutrient-insensitive (PubMed:17461779, PubMed:17599906, PubMed:29424687). mTORC2 seems to function upstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin cytoskeleton, probably by activating one or more Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors (PubMed:17461779, PubMed:17599906, PubMed:29424687). PRR5 plays an important role in regulation of PDGFRB expression and in modulation of platelet-derived growth factor signaling (PubMed:17599906). May act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer (PubMed:15718101).
