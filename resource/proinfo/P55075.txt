UniprotID	P55075
Accession	P55075;A1A514;Q14915;Q15766
EntryName	FGF8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF-8) (Androgen-induced growth factor) (AIGF) (Heparin-binding growth factor 8) (HBGF-8)
GeneName	FGF8 AIGF
Length	233
Function	Plays an important role in the regulation of embryonic development, cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell migration. Required for normal brain, eye, ear and limb development during embryogenesis. Required for normal development of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuronal system (PubMed:16384934, PubMed:16597617, PubMed:8663044). Plays a role in neurite outgrowth in hippocampal cells (PubMed:21576111).
