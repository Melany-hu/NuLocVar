UniprotID	Q9NQE9
Accession	Q9NQE9;B3KQ91;Q8N0Y9
EntryName	HINT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidase HINT3 (EC 3.9.1.-) (Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 3) (HINT-3)
GeneName	HINT3
Length	182
Function	Exhibits adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidase activity, hydrolyzing purine nucleotide phosphoramidates with a single phosphate group such as adenosine 5'monophosphoramidate (AMP-NH2) to yield AMP and NH2 (PubMed:17870088). Hydrolyzes lysyl-AMP (AMP-N-epsilon-(N-alpha-acetyl lysine methyl ester)) generated by lysine tRNA ligase (PubMed:17870088). Hydrolyzes 3-indolepropionic acyl-adenylate and fluorogenic purine nucleoside tryptamine phosphoramidates in vitro (PubMed:17870088).
