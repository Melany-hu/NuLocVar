UniprotID	P47900
Accession	P47900
EntryName	P2RY1_HUMAN
ProteinName	P2Y purinoceptor 1 (P2Y1) (ADP receptor) (Purinergic receptor)
GeneName	P2RY1
Length	373
Function	Receptor for extracellular adenine nucleotides such as ADP (PubMed:25822790, PubMed:9038354, PubMed:9442040). In platelets, binding to ADP leads to mobilization of intracellular calcium ions via activation of phospholipase C, a change in platelet shape, and ultimately platelet aggregation (PubMed:9442040).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
