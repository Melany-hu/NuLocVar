UniprotID	P03999
Accession	P03999;Q13877
EntryName	OPSB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Short-wave-sensitive opsin 1 (Blue cone photoreceptor pigment) (Blue-sensitive opsin) (BOP)
GeneName	OPN1SW BCP
Length	345
Function	Visual pigments are the light-absorbing molecules that mediate vision. They consist of an apoprotein, opsin, covalently linked to cis-retinal (Probable). Required for the maintenance of cone outer segment organization in the ventral retina, but not essential for the maintenance of functioning cone photoreceptors (By similarity). Involved in ensuring correct abundance and localization of retinal membrane proteins (By similarity). May increase spectral sensitivity in dim light (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Photoreceptor inner segment; Cell projection; Cilium; Photoreceptor outer segment; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region
