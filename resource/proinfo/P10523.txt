UniprotID	P10523
Accession	P10523;A0FDN6;Q53SV3;Q99858
EntryName	ARRS_HUMAN
ProteinName	S-arrestin (48 kDa protein) (Retinal S-antigen) (S-AG) (Rod photoreceptor arrestin)
GeneName	SAG
Length	405
Function	Binds to photoactivated, phosphorylated RHO and terminates RHO signaling via G-proteins by competing with G-proteins for the same binding site on RHO (By similarity). May play a role in preventing light-dependent degeneration of retinal photoreceptor cells (PubMed:9565049).
Subcellular Location	Cell projection; Cilium; Photoreceptor outer segment; Membrane
