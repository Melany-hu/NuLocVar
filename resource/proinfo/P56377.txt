UniprotID	P56377
Accession	P56377;B4DSU4;O95326;Q9H2N6
EntryName	AP1S2_HUMAN
ProteinName	AP-1 complex subunit sigma-2 (Adaptor protein complex AP-1 subunit sigma-1B) (Adaptor-related protein complex 1 subunit sigma-1B) (Clathrin assembly protein complex 1 sigma-1B small chain) (Golgi adaptor HA1/AP1 adaptin sigma-1B subunit) (Sigma 1B subunit of AP-1 clathrin) (Sigma-adaptin 1B) (Sigma1B-adaptin)
GeneName	AP1S2 DC22
Length	157
Function	Subunit of clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1 that plays a role in protein sorting in the late-Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN) and/or endosomes. The AP complexes mediate both the recruitment of clathrin to membranes and the recognition of sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Membrane; Clathrin-coated pit
