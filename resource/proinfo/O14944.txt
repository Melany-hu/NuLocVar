UniprotID	O14944
Accession	O14944;B2RC66;Q6FH69
EntryName	EREG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proepiregulin [Cleaved into: Epiregulin (EPR)]
GeneName	EREG
Length	169
Function	Ligand of the EGF receptor/EGFR and ERBB4. Stimulates EGFR and ERBB4 tyrosine phosphorylation (PubMed:9419975). Contributes to inflammation, wound healing, tissue repair, and oocyte maturation by regulating angiogenesis and vascular remodeling and by stimulating cell proliferation (PubMed:24631357).
