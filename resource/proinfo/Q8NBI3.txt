UniprotID	Q8NBI3
Accession	Q8NBI3;B6EV15;Q5SNX0;Q6UWK8
EntryName	DRAXI_HUMAN
ProteinName	Draxin (Dorsal inhibitory axon guidance protein) (Dorsal repulsive axon guidance protein) (Neucrin)
GeneName	DRAXIN C1orf187 PSEC0258 UNQ3119/PRO10268
Length	349
Function	Chemorepulsive axon guidance protein required for the development of spinal cord and forebrain commissures. Acts as a chemorepulsive guidance protein for commissural axons during development. Able to inhibit or repel neurite outgrowth from dorsal spinal cord. Inhibits the stabilization of cytosolic beta-catenin (CTNNB1) via its interaction with LRP6, thereby acting as an antagonist of Wnt signaling pathway.
