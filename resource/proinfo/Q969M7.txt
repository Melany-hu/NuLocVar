Accession	Q969M7;A8K1Z8;B4DDT9;B4DFI1;B4DMK3;B4DZU2;B8ZZG2;C9J212;H9KVB9
EntryName	UBE2F_HUMAN
ProteinName	NEDD8-conjugating enzyme UBE2F (EC 2.3.2.34) (NEDD8 carrier protein UBE2F) (NEDD8 protein ligase UBE2F) (NEDD8-conjugating enzyme 2) (RING-type E3 NEDD8 transferase UBE2F) (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 F)
GeneName	UBE2F NCE2
Length	185
Function	Accepts the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 from the UBA3-NAE1 E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins (PubMed:19250909, PubMed:23201271). Together with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF7/RBX2, specifically neddylates cullin-5 (CUL5) (PubMed:19250909, PubMed:23201271, PubMed:23300442). Does not neddylate CUL1, CUL2, CUL3, CUL4A or CUL4B (PubMed:19250909, PubMed:23201271). Mediates neddylation of the CUL9-RBX1 complex (PubMed:38605244).
