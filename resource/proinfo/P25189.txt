UniprotID	P25189
Accession	P25189;Q16072;Q5VTH4;Q92677;Q9BR67
EntryName	MYP0_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myelin protein P0 (Myelin peripheral protein) (MPP) (Myelin protein zero)
GeneName	MPZ
Length	248
Function	Is an adhesion molecule necessary for normal myelination in the peripheral nervous system. It mediates adhesion between adjacent myelin wraps and ultimately drives myelin compaction.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Myelin membrane
