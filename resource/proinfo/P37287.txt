Accession	P37287;B4E0V2;Q16025;Q16250
EntryName	PIGA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit A (EC 2.4.1.198) (GlcNAc-PI synthesis protein) (Phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class A protein) (PIG-A)
GeneName	PIGA
Length	484
Function	Catalytic subunit of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) complex that catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol and participates in the first step of GPI biosynthesis.
