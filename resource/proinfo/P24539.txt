UniprotID	P24539
Accession	P24539;Q9BQ68;Q9BRU8
EntryName	AT5F1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP synthase peripheral stalk subunit b, mitochondrial (ATP synthase F(0) complex subunit B1, mitochondrial) (ATP synthase peripheral stalk-membrane subunit b) (ATP synthase proton-transporting mitochondrial F(0) complex subunit B1) (ATP synthase subunit b) (ATPase subunit b)
GeneName	ATP5PB ATP5F1
Length	256
Function	Subunit b, of the mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase complex (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) that produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain (PubMed:37244256). ATP synthase complex consist of a soluble F(1) head domain - the catalytic core - and a membrane F(1) domain - the membrane proton channel (PubMed:37244256). These two domains are linked by a central stalk rotating inside the F(1) region and a stationary peripheral stalk (PubMed:37244256). During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation (Probable). In vivo, can only synthesize ATP although its ATP hydrolase activity can be activated artificially in vitro (By similarity). Part of the complex F(0) domain (PubMed:37244256). Part of the complex F(0) domain and the peripheric stalk, which acts as a stator to hold the catalytic alpha(3)beta(3) subcomplex and subunit a/ATP6 static relative to the rotary elements (By similarity).
