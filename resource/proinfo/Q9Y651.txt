UniprotID	Q9Y651
Accession	Q9Y651;P35715;Q15504;Q5TBS1
EntryName	SOX21_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor SOX-21 (SOX-A)
GeneName	SOX21 SOX25 SOXA
Length	276
Function	May play a role as an activator of transcription of OPRM1. Overexpression of SOX21 can up-regulate the OPRM1 distal promoter activity in mor-expressing neuronal cells. May play a role in ameloblast differentiation.
