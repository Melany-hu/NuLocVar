UniprotID	O00587
Accession	O00587;B4DLT6;O43730;Q504S9
EntryName	MFNG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase manic fringe (EC 2.4.1.222) (O-fucosylpeptide 3-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase)
GeneName	MFNG
Length	321
Function	Glycosyltransferase that initiates the elongation of O-linked fucose residues attached to EGF-like repeats in the extracellular domain of Notch molecules (By similarity). Modulates NOTCH1 activity by modifying O-fucose residues at specific EGF-like domains resulting in inhibition of NOTCH1 activation by JAG1 and enhancement of NOTCH1 activation by DLL1 via an increase in its binding to DLL1 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
