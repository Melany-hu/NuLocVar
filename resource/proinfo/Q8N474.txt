UniprotID	Q8N474
Accession	Q8N474;O00546;O14779
EntryName	SFRP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (FRP-1) (sFRP-1) (Secreted apoptosis-related protein 2) (SARP-2)
GeneName	SFRP1 FRP FRP1 SARP2
Length	314
Function	Soluble frizzled-related proteins (sFRPS) function as modulators of Wnt signaling through direct interaction with Wnts. They have a role in regulating cell growth and differentiation in specific cell types. SFRP1 decreases intracellular beta-catenin levels (By similarity). Has antiproliferative effects on vascular cells, in vitro and in vivo, and can induce, in vivo, an angiogenic response. In vascular cell cycle, delays the G1 phase and entry into the S phase (By similarity). In kidney development, inhibits tubule formation and bud growth in metanephroi (By similarity). Inhibits WNT1/WNT4-mediated TCF-dependent transcription.
