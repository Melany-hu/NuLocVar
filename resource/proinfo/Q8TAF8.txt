UniprotID	Q8TAF8
Accession	Q8TAF8;B3KX66
EntryName	LHPL5_HUMAN
ProteinName	LHFPL tetraspan subfamily member 5 protein (Lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 protein) (Tetraspan membrane protein of hair cell stereocilia)
GeneName	LHFPL5 TMHS
Length	219
Function	Auxiliary subunit of the mechanotransducer (MET) non-specific cation channel complex located at the tips of the shorter stereocilia of cochlear hair cells and that mediates sensory transduction in the auditory system. The MET complex is composed of two dimeric pore-forming ion-conducting transmembrane TMC (TMC1 or TMC2) subunits, and aided by several auxiliary proteins including LHFPL5, TMIE, CIB2/3 and TOMT, and the tip-link PCDH15. Functionally couples PCDH15 to the transduction channel.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
