EntryName	G6PT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucose-6-phosphate exchanger SLC37A4 (Glucose-5-phosphate transporter) (Glucose-6-phosphate translocase) (Solute carrier family 37 member 4) (Transformation-related gene 19 protein) (TRG-19)
GeneName	SLC37A4 G6PT G6PT1 PRO0685 TRG19
Length	429
Function	Inorganic phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate antiporter of the endoplasmic reticulum. Transports cytoplasmic glucose-6-phosphate into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and translocates inorganic phosphate into the opposite direction (PubMed:33964207). Forms with glucose-6-phosphatase the complex responsible for glucose production through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Hence, it plays a central role in homeostatic regulation of blood glucose levels.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
