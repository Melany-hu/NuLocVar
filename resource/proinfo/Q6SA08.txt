UniprotID	Q6SA08
Accession	Q6SA08;Q2TA60;Q6ZNM2
EntryName	TSSK4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase 4 (TSK-4) (TSSK-4) (Testis-specific kinase 4) (EC 2.7.11.1) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase 22E)
GeneName	TSSK4 C14orf20 STK22E TSSK5
Length	328
Function	Serine/threonine kinase which is involved in male germ cell development and in mature sperm function (By similarity). May be involved in the Cre/Creb signaling pathway (By similarity). Phosphorylates CREB1 on 'Ser-133' in vitro and can stimulate Cre/Creb pathway in cells (PubMed:15964553). Phosphorylates CREM on 'Ser-116' in vitro (By similarity). Phosphorylates ODF2 on 'Ser-95' (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Acrosome; Cell projection; Cilium; Flagellum
