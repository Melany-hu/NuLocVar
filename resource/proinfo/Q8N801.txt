UniprotID	Q8N801
Accession	Q8N801;H7C2Z2
EntryName	STPG4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein STPG4 (Gonad-specific expression gene protein) (GSE) (Sperm-tail PG-rich repeat-containing protein 4)
GeneName	STPG4 C2orf61
Length	248
Function	Maternal factor that plays a role in epigenetic chromatin reprogramming during early development of the zygote. Involved in the regulation of gametic DNA demethylation by inducing the conversion of the modified genomic base 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC).
