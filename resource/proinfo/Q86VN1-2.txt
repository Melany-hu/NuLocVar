UniprotID	Q86VN1-2
Accession	Q86VN1;A8K125;Q3ZCV7;Q5H9S1;Q5VXB6;Q9H8Z5;Q9Y3E3
EntryName	VPS36_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vacuolar protein-sorting-associated protein 36 (ELL-associated protein of 45 kDa) (ESCRT-II complex subunit VPS36)
GeneName	VPS36 C13orf9 EAP45 CGI-145
Length	328
Function	Component of the ESCRT-II complex (endosomal sorting complex required for transport II), which is required for multivesicular body (MVB) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. The MVB pathway mediates delivery of transmembrane proteins into the lumen of the lysosome for degradation. The ESCRT-II complex is probably involved in the recruitment of the ESCRT-III complex. Its ability to bind ubiquitin probably plays a role in endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated cargo proteins by ESCRT complexes. The ESCRT-II complex may also play a role in transcription regulation, possibly via its interaction with ELL. Binds phosphoinosides such as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.
