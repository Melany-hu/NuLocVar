UniprotID	Q6ZTR7
Accession	Q6ZTR7;A0A0D9SG36
EntryName	CBAR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	CBY1-interacting BAR domain-containing protein 2 (Protein FAM92B)
GeneName	CIBAR2 FAM92B
Length	304
Function	May play a role in ciliogenesis (By similarity). In cooperation with CBY1 may facilitate ciliogenesis likely by the recruitment and fusion of endosomal vesicles at distal appendages during early stages of ciliogenesis (PubMed:27528616).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Microtubule organizing center; Centrosome; Centriole; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium basal body
