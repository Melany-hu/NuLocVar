UniprotID	O00194
Accession	O00194;B2RAB0;Q9BZB6
EntryName	RB27B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-27B (EC 3.6.5.2) (C25KG)
GeneName	RAB27B
Length	218
Function	Small GTPase which cycles between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states. In its active state, binds to a variety of effector proteins to regulate homeostasis of late endocytic pathway, including endosomal positioning, maturation and secretion (PubMed:30771381). Plays a role in NTRK2/TRKB axonal anterograde transport by facilitating the association of NTRK2/TRKB with KLC1 (PubMed:21775604). May be involved in targeting uroplakins to urothelial apical membranes (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Late endosome
