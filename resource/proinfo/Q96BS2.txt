UniprotID	Q96BS2
Accession	Q96BS2;F5H1Y5;Q9NWT9
EntryName	CHP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcineurin B homologous protein 3 (Tescalcin) (TSC)
GeneName	TESC CHP3
Length	214
Function	Functions as an integral cofactor in cell pH regulation by controlling plasma membrane-type Na(+)/H(+) exchange activity. Promotes the maturation, transport, cell surface stability and exchange activity of SLC9A1/NHE1 at the plasma membrane. Promotes the induction of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation toward megakaryocytic lineage. Essential for the coupling of ERK cascade activation with the expression of ETS family genes in megakaryocytic differentiation. Also involved in granulocytic differentiation in a ERK-dependent manner. Inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin.
