UniprotID	O00231
Accession	O00231;A8K3I7;E1P663;O00495;Q53FT5
EntryName	PSD11_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 11 (26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN6) (26S proteasome regulatory subunit S9) (26S proteasome regulatory subunit p44.5)
GeneName	PSMD11
Length	422
Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair. In the complex, PSMD11 is required for proteasome assembly. Plays a key role in increased proteasome activity in embryonic stem cells (ESCs): its high expression in ESCs promotes enhanced assembly of the 26S proteasome, followed by higher proteasome activity.
