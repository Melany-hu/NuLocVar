UniprotID	Q16854
Accession	Q16854;P78532;Q16759;Q4ZG09;Q7L1W9;Q96BC1
EntryName	DGUOK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deoxyguanosine kinase, mitochondrial (EC 2.7.1.113) (Deoxyadenosine kinase, mitochondrial) (EC 2.7.1.76)
GeneName	DGUOK DGK
Length	277
Function	Phosphorylates deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine in the mitochondrial matrix, with the highest efficiency for deoxyguanosine (PubMed:11687801, PubMed:17073823, PubMed:23043144, PubMed:8692979, PubMed:8706825). In non-replicating cells, where cytosolic dNTP synthesis is down-regulated, mtDNA synthesis depends solely on DGUOK and TK2. Phosphorylates certain nucleoside analogs (By similarity). Widely used as target of antiviral and chemotherapeutic agents.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
