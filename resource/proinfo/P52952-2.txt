UniprotID	P52952-2
Accession	P52952;A8K3K0;B4DNB6;E9PBU6
EntryName	NKX25_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein Nkx-2.5 (Cardiac-specific homeobox) (Homeobox protein CSX) (Homeobox protein NK-2 homolog E)
GeneName	NKX2-5 CSX NKX2.5 NKX2E
Length	151
Function	Transcription factor required for the development of the heart and the spleen (PubMed:22560297). During heart development, acts as a transcriptional activator of NPPA/ANF in cooperation with GATA4 (By similarity). May cooperate with TBX2 to negatively modulate expression of NPPA/ANF in the atrioventricular canal (By similarity). Binds to the core DNA motif of NPPA promoter (PubMed:22849347, PubMed:26926761). Together with PBX1, required for spleen development through a mechanism that involves CDKN2B repression (PubMed:22560297). Positively regulates transcription of genes such as COL3A1 and MMP2, resulting in increased pulmonary endothelial fibrosis in response to hypoxia (PubMed:29899023).
