UniprotID	Q96KB5
Accession	Q96KB5;B4DX68;D3DST2;Q9NPD9;Q9NYL7;Q9NZK6
EntryName	TOPK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lymphokine-activated killer T-cell-originated protein kinase (EC 2.7.12.2) (Cancer/testis antigen 84) (CT84) (MAPKK-like protein kinase) (Nori-3) (PDZ-binding kinase) (Spermatogenesis-related protein kinase) (SPK) (T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase)
GeneName	PBK TOPK
Length	322
Function	Phosphorylates MAP kinase p38. Seems to be active only in mitosis. May also play a role in the activation of lymphoid cells. When phosphorylated, forms a complex with TP53, leading to TP53 destabilization and attenuation of G2/M checkpoint during doxorubicin-induced DNA damage.
