UniprotID	Q8N6C8
Accession	Q8N6C8;J3KPM2;O15469;O15470;O75016;Q8N151;Q8N154;Q8NHJ1;Q8NHJ2;Q8NHJ3;Q8NHJ4
EntryName	LIRA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily A member 3 (CD85 antigen-like family member E) (Immunoglobulin-like transcript 6) (ILT-6) (Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor 4) (LIR-4) (Monocyte inhibitory receptor HM43/HM31) (CD antigen CD85e)
GeneName	LILRA3 ILT6 LIR4
Length	439
Function	Acts as a soluble receptor for class I MHC antigens. Binds both classical and non-classical HLA class I molecules but with reduced affinities compared to LILRB1 or LILRB2. Binds with high affinity to the surface of monocytes, leading to abolish LPS-induced TNF-alpha production by monocytes.
