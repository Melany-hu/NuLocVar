UniprotID	P13804
Accession	P13804;B4DT43;Q53XN3
EntryName	ETFA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Electron transfer flavoprotein subunit alpha, mitochondrial (Alpha-ETF)
GeneName	ETFA
Length	333
Function	Heterodimeric electron transfer flavoprotein that accepts electrons from several mitochondrial dehydrogenases, including acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, glutaryl-CoA and sarcosine dehydrogenase (PubMed:10356313, PubMed:15159392, PubMed:15975918, PubMed:27499296, PubMed:9334218). It transfers the electrons to the main mitochondrial respiratory chain via ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF dehydrogenase) (PubMed:9334218). Required for normal mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and normal amino acid metabolism (PubMed:12815589, PubMed:1430199, PubMed:1882842).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
