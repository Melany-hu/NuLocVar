EntryName	RAB8A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-8A (EC 3.6.5.2) (Oncogene c-mel)
GeneName	RAB8A MEL RAB8
Length	207
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes. Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion. RAB8A is involved in polarized vesicular trafficking and neurotransmitter release. Together with RAB11A, RAB3IP, the exocyst complex, PARD3, PRKCI, ANXA2, CDC42 and DNMBP promotes transcytosis of PODXL to the apical membrane initiation sites (AMIS), apical surface formation and lumenogenesis (PubMed:20890297). Regulates the compacted morphology of the Golgi (PubMed:26209634). Together with MYO5B and RAB11A participates in epithelial cell polarization (PubMed:21282656). Also involved in membrane trafficking to the cilium and ciliogenesis (PubMed:21844891, PubMed:30398148, PubMed:20631154). Together with MICALL2, may also regulate adherens junction assembly (By similarity). May play a role in insulin-induced transport to the plasma membrane of the glucose transporter GLUT4 and therefore play a role in glucose homeostasis (By similarity). Involved in autophagy (PubMed:27103069). Participates in the export of a subset of neosynthesized proteins through a Rab8-Rab10-Rab11-dependent endososomal export route (PubMed:32344433). Targeted to and stabilized on stressed lysosomes through LRRK2 phosphorylation (PubMed:30209220). Suppresses stress-induced lysosomal enlargement through EHBP1 and EHNP1L1 effector proteins (PubMed:30209220).
