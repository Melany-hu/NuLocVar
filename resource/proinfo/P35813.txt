UniprotID	P35813
Accession	P35813;B5BU11;J3KNM0;O75551
EntryName	PPM1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein phosphatase 1A (EC 3.1.3.16) (Protein phosphatase 2C isoform alpha) (PP2C-alpha) (Protein phosphatase IA)
GeneName	PPM1A PPPM1A
Length	382
Function	Enzyme with a broad specificity. Negatively regulates TGF-beta signaling through dephosphorylating SMAD2 and SMAD3, resulting in their dissociation from SMAD4, nuclear export of the SMADs and termination of the TGF-beta-mediated signaling. Dephosphorylates PRKAA1 and PRKAA2. Plays an important role in the termination of TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappa-B activation through dephosphorylating and inactivating IKBKB/IKKB.
