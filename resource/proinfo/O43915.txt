UniprotID	O43915
Accession	O43915;B2R7Z3
EntryName	VEGFD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) (c-Fos-induced growth factor) (FIGF)
GeneName	VEGFD FIGF
Length	354
Function	Growth factor active in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and endothelial cell growth, stimulating their proliferation and migration and also has effects on the permeability of blood vessels. May function in the formation of the venous and lymphatic vascular systems during embryogenesis, and also in the maintenance of differentiated lymphatic endothelium in adults. Binds and activates VEGFR-2 (KDR/FLK1) and VEGFR-3 (FLT4) receptors.
