UniprotID	Q9BVT8
Accession	Q9BVT8;D3DX06;Q53AQ2
EntryName	TMUB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain-containing protein 1 (Dendritic cell-derived ubiquitin-like protein) (DULP) (Hepatocyte odd protein shuttling protein) (Ubiquitin-like protein SB144) [Cleaved into: iHOPS]
GeneName	TMUB1 C7orf21 DULP HOPS SB144 UNQ763/PRO1555
Length	246
Function	Involved in sterol-regulated ubiquitination and degradation of HMG-CoA reductase HMGCR (PubMed:21343306). Involved in positive regulation of AMPA-selective glutamate receptor GRIA2 recycling to the cell surface (By similarity). Acts as a negative regulator of hepatocyte growth during regeneration (By similarity).
