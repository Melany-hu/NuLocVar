EntryName	CHPT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cholinephosphotransferase 1 (hCPT1) (EC 2.7.8.2) (AAPT1-like protein) (Diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase 1)
GeneName	CHPT1 CPT1 MSTP022
Length	406
Function	Catalyzes the final step of de novo phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis, i.e. the transfer of choline phosphate from CDP-choline to the free hydroxyl of a diacylglycerol (DAG), producing a PC. It thereby plays a central role in the formation and maintenance of vesicular membranes.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
