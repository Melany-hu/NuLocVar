Function	Protein involved in mitophagy by facilitating recruitment of the autophagy machinery required for clearance of damaged mitochondria (PubMed:30982665). Accumulates on the mitochondria surface in response to mitochondrial depolarization and acts as a 'eat me' signal by recruiting proteins involved in selective autophagy, such as autophagy receptors (CALCOCO2/NDP52, NBR1, SQSTM1/p62, TAX1BP1 and WDFY3/ALFY) and ATG8 family proteins (MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B, MAP1LC3C, GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2) (PubMed:30982665).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
