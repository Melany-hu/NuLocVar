UniprotID	Q96EX3
Accession	Q96EX3;Q5VXV4;Q9BV46
EntryName	DC2I2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytoplasmic dynein 2 intermediate chain 2 (Dynein 2 intermediate chain 2) (WD repeat-containing protein 34)
GeneName	DYNC2I2 WDR34
Length	536
Function	Acts as one of several non-catalytic accessory components of the cytoplasmic dynein 2 complex (dynein-2 complex), a motor protein complex that drives the movement of cargos along microtubules within cilia and flagella in concert with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system (PubMed:25205765, PubMed:29742051). DYNC2I2 plays a major role in retrograde ciliary protein trafficking and in ciliogenesis (PubMed:29742051, PubMed:30320547, PubMed:30649997). Required also to maintain a functional transition zone (PubMed:30320547).
