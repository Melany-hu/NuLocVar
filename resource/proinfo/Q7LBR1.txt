UniprotID	Q7LBR1
Accession	Q7LBR1;Q96E89;Q9HD41
EntryName	CHM1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Charged multivesicular body protein 1b (CHMP1.5) (Chromatin-modifying protein 1b) (CHMP1b) (Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 46-2) (Vps46-2) (hVps46-2)
GeneName	CHMP1B C18orf2
Length	199
Function	Probable peripherally associated component of the endosomal sorting required for transport complex III (ESCRT-III) which is involved in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. Involved in cytokinesis. Involved in recruiting VPS4A and/or VPS4B and SPAST to the midbody of dividing cells. Involved in HIV-1 p6- and p9-dependent virus release.
