EntryName	P2RX4_HUMAN
ProteinName	P2X purinoceptor 4 (P2X4) (ATP receptor) (Purinergic receptor)
GeneName	P2RX4
Length	388
Function	ATP-gated nonselective transmembrane cation channel permeable to potassium, sodium and calcium (PubMed:9016352). CTP, but not GTP or UTP, functions as a weak affinity agonist for P2RX4 (By similarity). Activated by extracellularly released ATP, it plays multiple role in immunity and central nervous system physiology (PubMed:35165166). Plays a key role in initial steps of T-cell activation and Ca(2+) microdomain formation (By similarity). Also participates in basal T-cell activity without TCR/CD3 stimulation (By similarity). Promotes the differentiation and activation of Th17 cells via expression of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor C/RORC (PubMed:35165166). Upon activation, drives microglia motility via the PI3K/Akt pathway (By similarity). Could also function as an ATP-gated cation channel of lysosomal membranes (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Lysosome membrane
