UniprotID	Q8WV99
Accession	Q8WV99;Q8NB98
EntryName	ZFN2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	AN1-type zinc finger protein 2B (Arsenite-inducible RNA-associated protein-like protein) (AIRAP-like protein)
GeneName	ZFAND2B AIRAPL
Length	257
Function	Plays a role in protein homeostasis by regulating both the translocation and the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of nascent proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum. It is involved in the regulation of signal-mediated translocation of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum. It also plays a role in the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of proteins for which signal-mediated translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum has failed. May therefore function in the endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced pre-emptive quality control, a mechanism that selectively attenuates the translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum and reroutes them to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation (By similarity). By controlling the steady-state expression of the IGF1R receptor, indirectly regulates the insulin-like growth factor receptor signaling pathway (PubMed:26692333).
