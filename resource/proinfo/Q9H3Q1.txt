UniprotID	Q9H3Q1
Accession	Q9H3Q1;B3KUS7;O95828;Q96FT3
EntryName	BORG4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cdc42 effector protein 4 (Binder of Rho GTPases 4)
GeneName	CDC42EP4 BORG4 CEP4
Length	356
Function	Probably involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. May act downstream of CDC42 to induce actin filament assembly leading to cell shape changes. Induces pseudopodia formation, when overexpressed in fibroblasts.
