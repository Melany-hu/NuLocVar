UniprotID	Q86SE9
Accession	Q86SE9;B7Z892;D3DR33;Q6PK47;Q86TD0
EntryName	PCGF5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polycomb group RING finger protein 5 (RING finger protein 159)
GeneName	PCGF5 RNF159
Length	256
Function	Component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones; it mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119', rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility (PubMed:26151332). Within the PRC1-like complex, regulates RNF2 ubiquitin ligase activity (PubMed:26151332). Plays a redundant role with PCGF3 as part of a PRC1-like complex that mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119' on the X chromosome and is required for normal silencing of one copy of the X chromosome in XX females (By similarity).
