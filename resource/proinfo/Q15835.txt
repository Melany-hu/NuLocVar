UniprotID	Q15835
Accession	Q15835;Q53X14
EntryName	GRK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rhodopsin kinase GRK1 (RK) (EC 2.7.11.14) (G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1)
GeneName	GRK1 RHOK
Length	563
Function	Retina-specific kinase involved in the signal turnoff via phosphorylation of rhodopsin (RHO), the G protein- coupled receptor that initiates the phototransduction cascade (PubMed:15946941). This rapid desensitization is essential for scotopic vision and permits rapid adaptation to changes in illumination (By similarity). May play a role in the maintenance of the outer nuclear layer in the retina (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Cell projection; Cilium; Photoreceptor outer segment
