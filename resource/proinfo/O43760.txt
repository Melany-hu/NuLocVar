UniprotID	O43760
Accession	O43760;O43762;Q3KQZ2;Q658S7
EntryName	SNG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Synaptogyrin-2 (Cellugyrin)
GeneName	SYNGR2 UNQ352/PRO615
Length	224
Function	May play a role in regulated exocytosis. In neuronal cells, modulates the localization of synaptophysin/SYP into synaptic-like microvesicles and may therefore play a role in the formation and/or the maturation of this vesicles. May also play a role in GLUT4 storage and transport to the plasma membrane.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane; Lipid droplet
