EntryName	G37L1_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 37-like 1 (Endothelin B receptor-like protein 2) (ETBR-LP-2)
GeneName	GPR37L1 ETBRLP2
Length	481
Function	G-protein coupled receptor (PubMed:27072655). Has been shown to bind the neuroprotective and glioprotective factor prosaposin (PSAP), leading to endocytosis followed by an ERK phosphorylation cascade (PubMed:23690594). However, other studies have shown that prosaposin does not increase activity (PubMed:27072655, PubMed:28688853). It has been suggested that GPR37L1 is a constitutively active receptor which signals through the guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(s) subunit alpha (PubMed:27072655). Participates in the regulation of postnatal cerebellar development by modulating the Shh pathway (By similarity). Regulates baseline blood pressure in females and protects against cardiovascular stress in males (By similarity). Mediates inhibition of astrocyte glutamate transporters and reduction in neuronal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity (By similarity).
