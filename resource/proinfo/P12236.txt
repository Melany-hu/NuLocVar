UniprotID	P12236

EntryName	ADT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP/ATP translocase 3 (ADP,ATP carrier protein 3) (ADP,ATP carrier protein, isoform T2) (ANT 2) (Adenine nucleotide translocator 3) (ANT 3) (Solute carrier family 25 member 6) [Cleaved into: ADP/ATP translocase 3, N-terminally processed]
GeneName	SLC25A6 AAC3 ANT3 CDABP0051
Length	298
Function	ADP:ATP antiporter that mediates import of ADP into the mitochondrial matrix for ATP synthesis, and export of ATP out to fuel the cell (By similarity). Cycles between the cytoplasmic-open state (c-state) and the matrix-open state (m-state): operates by the alternating access mechanism with a single substrate-binding site intermittently exposed to either the cytosolic (c-state) or matrix (m-state) side of the inner mitochondrial membrane (By similarity). In addition to its ADP:ATP antiporter activity, also involved in mitochondrial uncoupling and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) activity (PubMed:15033708). Plays a role in mitochondrial uncoupling by acting as a proton transporter: proton transport uncouples the proton flows via the electron transport chain and ATP synthase to reduce the efficiency of ATP production and cause mitochondrial thermogenesis (By similarity). Proton transporter activity is inhibited by ADP:ATP antiporter activity, suggesting that SLC25A6/ANT3 acts as a master regulator of mitochondrial energy output by maintaining a delicate balance between ATP production (ADP:ATP antiporter activity) and thermogenesis (proton transporter activity) (By similarity). Proton transporter activity requires free fatty acids as cofactor, but does not transport it (By similarity). Also plays a key role in mPTP opening, a non-specific pore that enables free passage of the mitochondrial membranes to solutes of up to 1.5 kDa, and which contributes to cell death (PubMed:15033708). It is however unclear if SLC25A6/ANT3 constitutes a pore-forming component of mPTP or regulates it (By similarity).
