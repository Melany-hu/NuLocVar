Accession	Q9H7T9;C9EI59;Q53F70
EntryName	AUNIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Aurora kinase A- and ninein-interacting protein (AIBp)
GeneName	AUNIP C1orf135
Length	357
Function	DNA-binding protein that accumulates at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) following DNA damage and promotes DNA resection and homologous recombination (PubMed:29042561). Serves as a sensor of DNA damage: binds DNA with a strong preference for DNA substrates that mimic structures generated at stalled replication forks, and anchors RBBP8/CtIP to DSB sites to promote DNA end resection and ensuing homologous recombination repair (PubMed:29042561). Inhibits non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (PubMed:29042561). Required for the dynamic movement of AURKA at the centrosomes and spindle apparatus during the cell cycle (PubMed:20596670).
