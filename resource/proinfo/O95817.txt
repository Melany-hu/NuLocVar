EntryName	BAG3_HUMAN
ProteinName	BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 3 (BAG-3) (Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3) (Bcl-2-binding protein Bis) (Docking protein CAIR-1)
GeneName	BAG3 BIS
Length	575
Function	Co-chaperone for HSP70 and HSC70 chaperone proteins. Acts as a nucleotide-exchange factor (NEF) promoting the release of ADP from the HSP70 and HSC70 proteins thereby triggering client/substrate protein release. Nucleotide release is mediated via its binding to the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of HSPA8/HSC70 where as the substrate release is mediated via its binding to the substrate-binding domain (SBD) of HSPA8/HSC70 (PubMed:27474739, PubMed:9873016). Has anti-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10597216). Plays a role in the HSF1 nucleocytoplasmic transport (PubMed:26159920).
