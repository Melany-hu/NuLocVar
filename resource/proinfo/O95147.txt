UniprotID	O95147
Accession	O95147
EntryName	DUS14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity protein phosphatase 14 (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.48) (MKP-1-like protein tyrosine phosphatase) (MKP-L) (Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 6) (MAP kinase phosphatase 6) (MKP-6)
GeneName	DUSP14 MKP6
Length	198
Function	Involved in the inactivation of MAP kinases. Dephosphorylates ERK, JNK and p38 MAP-kinases. Plays a negative role in TCR signaling by dephosphorylating MAP3K7 adapter TAB1 leading to its inactivation (PubMed:24403530).
