UniprotID	Q8WY41
Accession	Q8WY41
EntryName	NANO1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nanos homolog 1 (NOS-1) (EC_Rep1a)
GeneName	NANOS1 NOS1
Length	292
Function	May act as a translational repressor which regulates translation of specific mRNAs by forming a complex with PUM2 that associates with the 3'-UTR of mRNA targets. Capable of interfering with the proadhesive and anti-invasive functions of E-cadherin. Up-regulates the production of MMP14 to promote tumor cell invasion.
