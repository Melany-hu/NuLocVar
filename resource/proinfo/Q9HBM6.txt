UniprotID	Q9HBM6
Accession	Q9HBM6;B2RUZ9;Q9Y2S3
EntryName	TAF9B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 9B (Neuronal cell death-related protein 7) (DN-7) (Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 9-like) (Transcription-associated factor TAFII31L)
GeneName	TAF9B TAF9L
Length	251
Function	Essential for cell viability. TAF9 and TAF9B are involved in transcriptional activation as well as repression of distinct but overlapping sets of genes. May have a role in gene regulation associated with apoptosis. TAFs are components of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, the TBP-free TAFII complex (TFTC), the PCAF histone acetylase complex and the STAGA transcription coactivator-HAT complex. TFIID or TFTC are essential for the regulation of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription.
