EntryName	GASR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gastrin/cholecystokinin type B receptor (CCK-B receptor) (CCK-BR) (Cholecystokinin-2 receptor) (CCK2-R)
GeneName	CCKBR CCKRB
Length	447
Function	Receptor for gastrin and cholecystokinin. The CCK-B receptors occur throughout the central nervous system where they modulate anxiety, analgesia, arousal, and neuroleptic activity. This receptor mediates its action by association with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
