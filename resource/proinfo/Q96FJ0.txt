ProteinName	AMSH-like protease (AMSH-LP) (EC 3.4.19.-) (STAM-binding protein-like 1)

Length	436
Function	Zinc metalloprotease that specifically cleaves 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:18758443, PubMed:35114100). Acts as a positive regulator of the TORC1 signaling pathway by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked deubiquitination of SESN2, thereby inhibiting SESN2-interaction with the GATOR2 complex (PubMed:35114100). Does not cleave 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:18758443).
