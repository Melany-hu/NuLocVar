UniprotID	O00421
Accession	O00421;B4DKQ8;O75307;Q4VBB0;Q6IPX0;Q7KYQ9;Q96KP5;Q9UPG0
EntryName	CCRL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C chemokine receptor-like 2 (Chemokine receptor CCR11) (Chemokine receptor X) (Putative MCP-1 chemokine receptor)
GeneName	CCRL2 CCR11 CCR6 CKRX CRAM HCR
Length	344
Function	Receptor for CCL19 and chemerin/RARRES2. Does not appear to be a signaling receptor, but may have a role in modulating chemokine-triggered immune responses by capturing and internalizing CCL19 or by presenting RARRES2 ligand to CMKLR1, a functional signaling receptors. Plays a critical role for the development of Th2 responses.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
