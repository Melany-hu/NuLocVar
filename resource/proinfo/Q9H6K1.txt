UniprotID	Q9H6K1
Accession	Q9H6K1;B2R8K7;Q5VV77;Q96MG5;Q9BUR9
EntryName	ILRUN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein ILRUN (Inflammation and lipid regulator with UBA-like and NBR1-like domains protein)
GeneName	ILRUN C6orf106
Length	298
Function	Negative regulator of innate antiviral response. Blocks IRF3-dependent cytokine production such as IFNA, IFNB and TNF (PubMed:29802199). Interacts with IRF3 and inhibits IRF3 recruitment to type I IFN promoter sequences while also reducing nuclear levels of the coactivators EP300 and CREBBP (PubMed:29802199).
