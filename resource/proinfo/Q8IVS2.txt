UniprotID	Q8IVS2
Accession	Q8IVS2;B0QY72;O95510;O95511
EntryName	FABD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Malonyl-CoA-acyl carrier protein transacylase, mitochondrial (MCT) (EC 2.3.1.39) (Mitochondrial malonyl CoA:ACP acyltransferase) (Mitochondrial malonyltransferase) ([Acyl-carrier-protein] malonyltransferase)
GeneName	MCAT MT
Length	390
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of a malonyl moiety from malonyl-CoA to the free thiol group of the phosphopantetheine arm of the mitochondrial ACP protein (NDUFAB1) (PubMed:12882974, PubMed:19549604). This suggests the existence of the biosynthesis of fatty acids in mitochondria (PubMed:12882974). Also acts as a mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (mt-SSU) assembly factor (PubMed:36482135).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
