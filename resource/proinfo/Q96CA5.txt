EntryName	BIRC7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 7 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Kidney inhibitor of apoptosis protein) (KIAP) (Livin) (Melanoma inhibitor of apoptosis protein) (ML-IAP) (RING finger protein 50) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase BIRC7) [Cleaved into: Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 7 30kDa subunit (Truncated livin) (p30-Livin) (tLivin)]
GeneName	BIRC7 KIAP LIVIN MLIAP RNF50 UNQ5800/PRO19607/PRO21344
Length	298
Function	Apoptotic regulator capable of exerting proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities and plays crucial roles in apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cell cycle control (PubMed:11024045, PubMed:11084335, PubMed:11162435, PubMed:16729033, PubMed:17294084). Its anti-apoptotic activity is mediated through the inhibition of CASP3, CASP7 and CASP9, as well as by its E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (PubMed:11024045, PubMed:16729033). As it is a weak caspase inhibitor, its anti-apoptotic activity is thought to be due to its ability to ubiquitinate DIABLO/SMAC targeting it for degradation thereby promoting cell survival (PubMed:16729033). May contribute to caspase inhibition, by blocking the ability of DIABLO/SMAC to disrupt XIAP/BIRC4-caspase interactions (PubMed:16729033). Protects against apoptosis induced by TNF or by chemical agents such as adriamycin, etoposide or staurosporine (PubMed:11084335, PubMed:11162435, PubMed:11865055). Suppression of apoptosis is mediated by activation of MAPK8/JNK1, and possibly also of MAPK9/JNK2 (PubMed:11865055). This activation depends on TAB1 and MAP3K7/TAK1 (PubMed:11865055). In vitro, inhibits CASP3 and proteolytic activation of pro-CASP9 (PubMed:11024045).
