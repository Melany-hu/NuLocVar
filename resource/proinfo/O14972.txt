Function	Acts as a component of the retriever complex. The retriever complex is a heterotrimeric complex related to retromer cargo-selective complex (CSC) and essential for retromer-independent retrieval and recycling of numerous cargos such as integrin alpha-5/beta-1 (ITGA5:ITGB1) (PubMed:28892079). The recruitment of the retriever complex to the endosomal membrane involves CCC and WASH complexes (PubMed:28892079). In the endosomes, drives the retriever and recycling of NxxY-motif-containing cargo proteins by coupling to SNX17, a cargo essential for the homeostatic maintenance of numerous cell surface proteins associated with processes that include cell migration, cell adhesion, nutrient supply and cell signaling (PubMed:28892079).
