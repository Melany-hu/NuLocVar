UniprotID	Q9UBI6
Accession	Q9UBI6;Q69YP5;Q9BRV5
EntryName	GBG12_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(O) subunit gamma-12
GeneName	GNG12
Length	72
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
