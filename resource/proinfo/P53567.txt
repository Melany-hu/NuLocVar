UniprotID	P53567
Accession	P53567;B2R946;Q5U052
EntryName	CEBPG_HUMAN
ProteinName	CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein gamma (C/EBP gamma)
GeneName	CEBPG
Length	150
Function	Transcription factor that binds to the promoter and the enhancer regions of target genes. Binds to the enhancer element PRE-I (positive regulatory element-I) of the IL-4 gene (PubMed:7665092). Binds to the promoter and the enhancer of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Binds to GPE1, a cis-acting element in the G-CSF gene promoter.
