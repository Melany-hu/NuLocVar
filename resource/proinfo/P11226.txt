EntryName	MBL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mannose-binding protein C (MBP-C) (Collectin-1) (MBP1) (Mannan-binding protein) (Mannose-binding lectin)
GeneName	MBL2 COLEC1 MBL
Length	248
Function	Calcium-dependent lectin involved in innate immune defense (PubMed:35102342). Binds mannose, fucose and N-acetylglucosamine on different microorganisms and activates the lectin complement pathway. Binds to late apoptotic cells, as well as to apoptotic blebs and to necrotic cells, but not to early apoptotic cells, facilitating their uptake by macrophages. May bind DNA. Upon SARS coronavirus-2/SARS-CoV-2 infection, activates the complement lectin pathway which leads to the inhibition SARS-CoV-2 infection and a reduction of the induced inflammatory response (PubMed:35102342).
