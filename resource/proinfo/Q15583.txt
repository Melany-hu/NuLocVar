UniprotID	Q15583
Accession	Q15583;A6NE42;A6NLU7;F8VZB6;Q6ICR0;Q8N5X9;Q9NRS0
EntryName	TGIF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein TGIF1 (5'-TG-3'-interacting factor 1)
GeneName	TGIF1 TGIF
Length	401
Function	Binds to a retinoid X receptor (RXR) responsive element from the cellular retinol-binding protein II promoter (CRBPII-RXRE). Inhibits the 9-cis-retinoic acid-dependent RXR alpha transcription activation of the retinoic acid responsive element. Active transcriptional corepressor of SMAD2. Links the nodal signaling pathway to the bifurcation of the forebrain and the establishment of ventral midline structures. May participate in the transmission of nuclear signals during development and in the adult, as illustrated by the down-modulation of the RXR alpha activities.
