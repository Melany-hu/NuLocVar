UniprotID	Q969G6
Accession	Q969G6;Q5JSG9;Q9NUT7
EntryName	RIFK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Riboflavin kinase (EC 2.7.1.26) (ATP:riboflavin 5'-phosphotransferase) (Flavokinase)
GeneName	RFK
Length	155
Function	Catalyzes the phosphorylation of riboflavin (vitamin B2) to form flavin-mononucleotide (FMN), hence rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of FAD. Essential for TNF-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Through its interaction with both TNFRSF1A and CYBA, physically and functionally couples TNFRSF1A to NADPH oxidase. TNF-activation of RFK may enhance the incorporation of FAD in NADPH oxidase, a critical step for the assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase.
