UniprotID	P62263
Accession	P62263;B2R5G5;D3DQG5;P06366;Q5BJI0
EntryName	RS14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Small ribosomal subunit protein uS11 (40S ribosomal protein S14)
GeneName	RPS14 PRO2640
Length	151
Function	Component of the small ribosomal subunit. The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell. Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
