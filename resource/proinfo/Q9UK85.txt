UniprotID	Q9UK85
Accession	Q9UK85
EntryName	DKKL1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dickkopf-like protein 1 (Cancer/testis antigen 34) (CT34) (Protein soggy-1) (SGY-1)
GeneName	DKKL1 SGY1 UNQ735/PRO1429
Length	242
Function	Involved in fertilization by facilitating sperm penetration of the zona pellucida. May promote spermatocyte apoptosis, thereby limiting sperm production. In adults, may reduce testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells. Is not essential either for development or fertility.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Acrosome
