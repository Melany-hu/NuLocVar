EntryName	TM10C_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA methyltransferase 10 homolog C (HBV pre-S2 trans-regulated protein 2) (Mitochondrial ribonuclease P protein 1) (Mitochondrial RNase P protein 1) (RNA (guanine-9-)-methyltransferase domain-containing protein 1) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-49) (mRNA methyladenosine-N(1)-methyltransferase) (EC 2.1.1.-) (tRNA (adenine(9)-N(1))-methyltransferase) (EC 2.1.1.218) (tRNA (guanine(9)-N(1))-methyltransferase) (EC 2.1.1.221)
GeneName	TRMT10C MRPP1 RG9MTD1
Length	403
Function	Mitochondrial tRNA N(1)-methyltransferase involved in mitochondrial tRNA maturation (PubMed:18984158, PubMed:21593607, PubMed:23042678, PubMed:27132592). Component of mitochondrial ribonuclease P, a complex composed of TRMT10C/MRPP1, HSD17B10/MRPP2 and PRORP/MRPP3, which cleaves tRNA molecules in their 5'-ends (PubMed:18984158). Together with HSD17B10/MRPP2, forms a subcomplex of the mitochondrial ribonuclease P, named MRPP1-MRPP2 subcomplex, which displays functions that are independent of the ribonuclease P activity (PubMed:23042678, PubMed:29040705). The MRPP1-MRPP2 subcomplex catalyzes the formation of N(1)-methylguanine and N(1)-methyladenine at position 9 (m1G9 and m1A9, respectively) in tRNAs; TRMT10C/MRPP1 acting as the catalytic N(1)-methyltransferase subunit (PubMed:23042678). The MRPP1-MRPP2 subcomplex also acts as a tRNA maturation platform: following 5'-end cleavage by the mitochondrial ribonuclease P complex, the MRPP1-MRPP2 subcomplex enhances the efficiency of 3'-processing catalyzed by ELAC2, retains the tRNA product after ELAC2 processing and presents the nascent tRNA to the mitochondrial CCA tRNA nucleotidyltransferase TRNT1 enzyme (PubMed:29040705). In addition to tRNA N(1)-methyltransferase activity, TRMT10C/MRPP1 also acts as a mRNA N(1)-methyltransferase by mediating methylation of adenosine residues at the N(1) position of MT-ND5 mRNA (PubMed:29072297). Associates with mitochondrial DNA complexes at the nucleoids to initiate RNA processing and ribosome assembly.
