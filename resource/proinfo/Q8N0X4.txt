UniprotID	Q8N0X4
Accession	Q8N0X4;Q5W0F7;Q8TDH8
EntryName	CLYBL_HUMAN
ProteinName	Citramalyl-CoA lyase, mitochondrial (EC 4.1.3.25) ((3S)-malyl-CoA thioesterase) (EC 3.1.2.30) (Beta-methylmalate synthase) (EC 2.3.3.-) (Citrate lyase subunit beta-like protein) (Citrate lyase beta-like) (Malate synthase) (EC 2.3.3.9)
GeneName	CLYBL CLB
Length	340
Function	Mitochondrial citramalyl-CoA lyase indirectly involved in the vitamin B12 metabolism (PubMed:29056341). Converts citramalyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA and pyruvate in the C5-dicarboxylate catabolism pathway (PubMed:29056341). The C5-dicarboxylate catabolism pathway is required to detoxify itaconate, a vitamin B12-poisoning metabolite (PubMed:29056341). Also acts as a malate synthase in vitro, converting glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA to malate (PubMed:24334609, PubMed:29056341). Also displays malyl-CoA thioesterase activity (PubMed:29056341). Also acts as a beta-methylmalate synthase in vitro, by mediating conversion of glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA to beta-methylmalate (PubMed:24334609, PubMed:29056341). Also has very weak citramalate synthase activity in vitro (PubMed:24334609, PubMed:29056341).
