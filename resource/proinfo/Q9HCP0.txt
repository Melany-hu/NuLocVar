UniprotID	Q9HCP0
Accession	Q9HCP0;Q5JPH1;Q96AE9;Q9HCP1
EntryName	KC1G1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Casein kinase I isoform gamma-1 (CKI-gamma 1) (EC 2.7.11.1)
GeneName	CSNK1G1
Length	422
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase. Casein kinases are operationally defined by their preferential utilization of acidic proteins such as caseins as substrates. It can phosphorylate a large number of proteins. Participates in Wnt signaling. Regulates fast synaptic transmission mediated by glutamate (By similarity). Phosphorylates CLSPN.
