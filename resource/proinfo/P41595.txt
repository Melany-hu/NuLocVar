EntryName	5HT2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B (5-HT-2B) (5-HT2B) (Serotonin receptor 2B)
GeneName	HTR2B
Length	481
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (PubMed:18703043, PubMed:23519210, PubMed:7926008, PubMed:8078486, PubMed:8143856, PubMed:8882600). Also functions as a receptor for various ergot alkaloid derivatives and psychoactive substances (PubMed:12970106, PubMed:18703043, PubMed:23519210, PubMed:23519215, PubMed:24357322, PubMed:28129538, PubMed:30127358, PubMed:36087581, PubMed:7926008, PubMed:8078486, PubMed:8143856). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors (PubMed:23519215, PubMed:28129538, PubMed:8078486, PubMed:8143856, PubMed:8882600). HTR2B is coupled to G(q)/G(11) G alpha proteins and activates phospholipase C-beta, releasing diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) second messengers that modulate the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and promote the release of Ca(2+) ions from intracellular stores, respectively (PubMed:18703043, PubMed:23519215, PubMed:28129538, PubMed:30127358, PubMed:36087581, PubMed:8078486, PubMed:8143856, PubMed:8882600). Beta-arrestin family members inhibit signaling via G proteins and mediate activation of alternative signaling pathways (PubMed:23519215, PubMed:28129538, PubMed:30127358, PubMed:36087581). Plays a role in the regulation of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine release, 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake and in the regulation of extracellular dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels, and thereby affects neural activity. May play a role in the perception of pain (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of behavior, including impulsive behavior (PubMed:21179162). Required for normal proliferation of embryonic cardiac myocytes and normal heart development (By similarity). Protects cardiomyocytes against apoptosis (By similarity). Plays a role in the adaptation of pulmonary arteries to chronic hypoxia (By similarity). Plays a role in vasoconstriction (By similarity). Required for normal osteoblast function and proliferation, and for maintaining normal bone density (By similarity). Required for normal proliferation of the interstitial cells of Cajal in the intestine (By similarity).
