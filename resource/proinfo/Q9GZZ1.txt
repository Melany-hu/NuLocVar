UniprotID	Q9GZZ1
Accession	Q9GZZ1;D3DN74;Q68DQ1
EntryName	NAA50_HUMAN
ProteinName	N-alpha-acetyltransferase 50 (hNaa50p) (EC 2.3.1.258) (N-acetyltransferase 13) (N-acetyltransferase 5) (hNAT5) (N-acetyltransferase san homolog) (hSAN) (N-epsilon-acetyltransferase 50) (EC 2.3.1.-) (NatE catalytic subunit)
GeneName	NAA50 MAK3 NAT13 NAT5
Length	169
Function	N-alpha-acetyltransferase that acetylates the N-terminus of proteins that retain their initiating methionine (PubMed:19744929, PubMed:21900231, PubMed:22311970, PubMed:27484799). Has a broad substrate specificity: able to acetylate the initiator methionine of most peptides, except for those with a proline in second position (PubMed:27484799). Also displays N-epsilon-acetyltransferase activity by mediating acetylation of the side chain of specific lysines on proteins (PubMed:19744929). Autoacetylates in vivo (PubMed:19744929). The relevance of N-epsilon-acetyltransferase activity is however unclear: able to acetylate H4 in vitro, but this result has not been confirmed in vivo (PubMed:19744929). Component of N-alpha-acetyltransferase complexes containing NAA10 and NAA15, which has N-alpha-acetyltransferase activity (PubMed:16507339, PubMed:27484799, PubMed:29754825, PubMed:32042062). Does not influence the acetyltransferase activity of NAA10 (PubMed:16507339, PubMed:27484799). However, it negatively regulates the N-alpha-acetyltransferase activity of the N-terminal acetyltransferase A complex (also called the NatA complex) (PubMed:32042062). The multiprotein complexes probably constitute the major contributor for N-terminal acetylation at the ribosome exit tunnel, with NAA10 acetylating all amino termini that are devoid of methionine and NAA50 acetylating other peptides (PubMed:16507339, PubMed:27484799). Required for sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis by promoting binding of CDCA5/sororin to cohesin: may act by counteracting the function of NAA10 (PubMed:17502424, PubMed:27422821).
