EntryName	SIR4_HUMAN
ProteinName	NAD-dependent protein lipoamidase sirtuin-4, mitochondrial (EC 2.3.1.-) (NAD-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase sirtuin-4) (EC 2.4.2.-) (NAD-dependent protein biotinylase sirtuin-4) (EC 2.3.1.-) (NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-4) (EC 2.3.1.286) (Regulatory protein SIR2 homolog 4) (SIR2-like protein 4)
GeneName	SIRT4 SIR2L4
Length	314
Function	Acts as a NAD-dependent protein lipoamidase, biotinylase, deacetylase and ADP-ribosyl transferase (PubMed:16959573, PubMed:17715127, PubMed:24052263, PubMed:25525879). Catalyzes more efficiently removal of lipoyl- and biotinyl- than acetyl-lysine modifications (PubMed:24052263, PubMed:25525879). Inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) activity via the enzymatic hydrolysis of the lipoamide cofactor from the E2 component, DLAT, in a phosphorylation-independent manner (PubMed:25525879). Catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribosyl groups onto target proteins, including mitochondrial GLUD1, inhibiting GLUD1 enzyme activity (PubMed:16959573, PubMed:17715127). Acts as a negative regulator of mitochondrial glutamine metabolism by mediating mono ADP-ribosylation of GLUD1: expressed in response to DNA damage and negatively regulates anaplerosis by inhibiting GLUD1, leading to block metabolism of glutamine into tricarboxylic acid cycle and promoting cell cycle arrest (PubMed:16959573, PubMed:17715127). In response to mTORC1 signal, SIRT4 expression is repressed, promoting anaplerosis and cell proliferation (PubMed:23663782). Acts as a tumor suppressor (PubMed:23562301, PubMed:23663782). Also acts as a NAD-dependent protein deacetylase: mediates deacetylation of 'Lys-471' of MLYCD, inhibiting its activity, thereby acting as a regulator of lipid homeostasis (By similarity). Does not seem to deacetylate PC (PubMed:23438705). Controls fatty acid oxidation by inhibiting PPARA transcriptional activation (PubMed:24043310). Impairs SIRT1-PPARA interaction probably through the regulation of NAD(+) levels (PubMed:24043310). Down-regulates insulin secretion (PubMed:17715127).
