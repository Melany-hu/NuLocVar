UniprotID	Q9NXK6
Accession	Q9NXK6;Q8IXU2
EntryName	PAQR5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Membrane progestin receptor gamma (mPR gamma) (Membrane progesterone P4 receptor gamma) (Membrane progesterone receptor gamma) (Progesterone and adipoQ receptor family member 5) (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 5) (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member V)
GeneName	PAQR5 MPRG
Length	330
Function	Plasma membrane progesterone (P4) receptor coupled to G proteins (PubMed:23763432). Seems to act through a G(i) mediated pathway (PubMed:23763432). May be involved in oocyte maturation (PubMed:12601167).
