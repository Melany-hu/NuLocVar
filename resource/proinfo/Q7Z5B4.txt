EntryName	RIC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein RIC-3 (Resistant to inhibitor of cholinesterase 3)
GeneName	RIC3 UNQ720/PRO1385
Length	369
Function	Molecular chaperone which facilitates proper subunit assembly and surface trafficking of alpha-7 (CHRNA7) and alpha-8 (CHRNA8) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (PubMed:12821669, PubMed:15504725, PubMed:16120769, PubMed:18691158, PubMed:32204458).
