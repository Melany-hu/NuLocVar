EntryName	KCJ15_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP-sensitive inward rectifier potassium channel 15 (Inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir1.3) (Inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir4.2) (Potassium channel, inwardly rectifying subfamily J member 15)
GeneName	KCNJ15 KCNJ14
Length	375
Function	Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium.
