EntryName	TBA4A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tubulin alpha-4A chain (EC 3.6.5.-) (Alpha-tubulin 1) (Testis-specific alpha-tubulin) (Tubulin H2-alpha) (Tubulin alpha-1 chain)
GeneName	TUBA4A TUBA1
Length	448
Function	Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules, a cylinder consisting of laterally associated linear protofilaments composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers. Microtubules grow by the addition of GTP-tubulin dimers to the microtubule end, where a stabilizing cap forms. Below the cap, tubulin dimers are in GDP-bound state, owing to GTPase activity of alpha-tubulin.
