EntryName	MBD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 1 (CXXC-type zinc finger protein 3) (Methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD1) (Protein containing methyl-CpG-binding domain 1)
GeneName	MBD1 CXXC3 PCM1
Length	605
Function	Transcriptional repressor that binds CpG islands in promoters where the DNA is methylated at position 5 of cytosine within CpG dinucleotides. Binding is abolished by the presence of 7-mG that is produced by DNA damage by methylmethanesulfonate (MMS). Acts as transcriptional repressor and plays a role in gene silencing by recruiting ATF7IP, which in turn recruits factors such as the histone methyltransferase SETDB1. Probably forms a complex with SETDB1 and ATF7IP that represses transcription and couples DNA methylation and histone 'Lys-9' trimethylation. Isoform 1 and isoform 2 can also repress transcription from unmethylated promoters.
