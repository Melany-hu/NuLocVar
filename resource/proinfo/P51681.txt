EntryName	CCR5_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (C-C CKR-5) (CC-CKR-5) (CCR-5) (CCR5) (CHEMR13) (HIV-1 fusion coreceptor) (CD antigen CD195)
GeneName	CCR5 CMKBR5
Length	352
Function	Receptor for a number of inflammatory CC-chemokines including CCL3/MIP-1-alpha, CCL4/MIP-1-beta and RANTES and subsequently transduces a signal by increasing the intracellular calcium ion level. May play a role in the control of granulocytic lineage proliferation or differentiation. Participates in T-lymphocyte migration to the infection site by acting as a chemotactic receptor (PubMed:30713770).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
