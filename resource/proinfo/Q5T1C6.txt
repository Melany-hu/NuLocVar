UniprotID	Q5T1C6
Accession	Q5T1C6;B2RBX2;Q96KR2
EntryName	THEM4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Acyl-coenzyme A thioesterase THEM4 (Acyl-CoA thioesterase THEM4) (EC 3.1.2.2) (Carboxyl-terminal modulator protein) (Thioesterase superfamily member 4)
GeneName	THEM4 CTMP
Length	240
Function	Has acyl-CoA thioesterase activity towards medium and long-chain (C14 to C18) fatty acyl-CoA substrates, and probably plays a role in mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism. Plays a role in the apoptotic process, possibly via its regulation of AKT1 activity. According to PubMed:11598301, inhibits AKT1 phosphorylation and activity. According to PubMed:17615157, enhances AKT1 activity by favoring its phosphorylation and translocation to plasma membrane.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cell projection; Ruffle membrane; Cytoplasm; Mitochondrion; Mitochondrion inner membrane; Mitochondrion intermembrane space
