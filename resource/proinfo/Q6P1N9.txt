UniprotID	Q6P1N9
Accession	Q6P1N9;B2R5J0;Q8TD02;Q9BY40
EntryName	TATD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deoxyribonuclease TATDN1 (EC 3.1.21.-) (Hepatocarcinoma high expression protein)
GeneName	TATDN1 CDA11
Length	297
Function	Deoxyribonuclease which catalyzes (in vitro) the decatenation of kinetoplast DNA, which are circular DNA catenated to each other, producing linear DNA molecules (By similarity). Plays an important role in chromosomal segregation and cell cycle progression during eye development probably via its DNA decatenation activity (By similarity).
