Accession	Q13637
EntryName	RAB32_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related protein Rab-32 (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	RAB32
Length	225
Function	The small GTPases Rab are key regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking, from the formation of transport vesicles to their fusion with membranes (PubMed:11784320, PubMed:21808068). Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different set of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion (PubMed:11784320). Also acts as an A-kinase anchoring protein by binding to the type II regulatory subunit of protein kinase A and anchoring it to the mitochondrion. Also involved in synchronization of mitochondrial fission (PubMed:12186851). Plays a role in the maturation of phagosomes that engulf pathogens, such as S.aureus and M.tuberculosis (PubMed:21255211). Plays an important role in the control of melanin production and melanosome biogenesis (PubMed:23084991). In concert with RAB38, regulates the proper trafficking of melanogenic enzymes TYR, TYRP1 and DCT/TYRP2 to melanosomes in melanocytes (By similarity). Stimulates phosphorylation of RAB10 'Thr-73' by LRRK2 (PubMed:38127736).
