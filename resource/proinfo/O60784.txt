UniprotID	O60784
Accession	O60784;B4DEL9;B4DNA1;Q5TIJ6;Q86X74
EntryName	TOM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Target of Myb1 membrane trafficking protein (Target of Myb protein 1)
GeneName	TOM1
Length	492
Function	Adapter protein that plays a role in the intracellular membrane trafficking of ubiquitinated proteins, thereby participating in autophagy, ubiquitination-dependent signaling and receptor recycling pathways (PubMed:14563850, PubMed:15047686, PubMed:23023224, PubMed:25588840, PubMed:26320582, PubMed:31371777). Acts as a MYO6/Myosin VI adapter protein that targets MYO6 to endocytic structures (PubMed:23023224). Together with MYO6, required for autophagosomal delivery of endocytic cargo, the maturation of autophagosomes and their fusion with lysosomes (PubMed:23023224). MYO6 links TOM1 with autophagy receptors, such as TAX1BP1; CALCOCO2/NDP52 and OPTN (PubMed:31371777). Binds to polyubiquitinated proteins via its GAT domain (PubMed:14563850). In a complex with TOLLIP, recruits ubiquitin-conjugated proteins onto early endosomes (PubMed:15047686). The Tom1-Tollip complex may regulate endosomal trafficking by linking polyubiquitinated proteins to clathrin (PubMed:14563850, PubMed:15047686). Mediates clathrin recruitment to early endosomes by ZFYVE16 (PubMed:15657082). Modulates binding of TOLLIP to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) via binding competition; the association with TOLLIP may favor the release of TOLLIP from endosomal membranes, allowing TOLLIP to commit to cargo trafficking (PubMed:26320582). Acts as a phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns(5)P) effector by binding to PtdIns(5)P, thereby regulating endosomal maturation (PubMed:25588840). PtdIns(5)P-dependent recruitment to signaling endosomes may block endosomal maturation (PubMed:25588840). Also inhibits Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and participates in immune receptor recycling (PubMed:15047686, PubMed:26320582).
