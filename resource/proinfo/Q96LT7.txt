ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide exchange factor C9orf72
GeneName	C9orf72 DENND9 DENNL72
Length	481
Function	Component of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex, a complex that has guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity and regulates autophagy (PubMed:27103069, PubMed:27193190, PubMed:27617292, PubMed:28195531, PubMed:32303654). In the complex, C9orf72 and SMCR8 probably constitute the catalytic subunits that promote the exchange of GDP to GTP, converting inactive GDP-bound RAB8A and RAB39B into their active GTP-bound form, thereby promoting autophagosome maturation (PubMed:27103069). The C9orf72-SMCR8 complex also acts as a regulator of autophagy initiation by interacting with the ULK1/ATG1 kinase complex and modulating its protein kinase activity (PubMed:27617292). As part of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex, stimulates RAB8A and RAB11A GTPase activity in vitro (PubMed:32303654). Positively regulates initiation of autophagy by regulating the RAB1A-dependent trafficking of the ULK1/ATG1 kinase complex to the phagophore which leads to autophagosome formation (PubMed:27334615). Acts as a regulator of mTORC1 signaling by promoting phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates (PubMed:27559131). Plays a role in endosomal trafficking (PubMed:24549040). May be involved in regulating the maturation of phagosomes to lysosomes (By similarity). Promotes the lysosomal localization and lysosome-mediated degradation of CARM1 which leads to inhibition of starvation-induced lipid metabolism (By similarity). Regulates actin dynamics in motor neurons by inhibiting the GTP-binding activity of ARF6, leading to ARF6 inactivation (PubMed:27723745). This reduces the activity of the LIMK1 and LIMK2 kinases which are responsible for phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin, leading to CFL1/cofilin activation (PubMed:27723745). Positively regulates axon extension and axon growth cone size in spinal motor neurons (PubMed:27723745). Required for SMCR8 protein expression and localization at pre- and post-synaptic compartments in the forebrain, also regulates protein abundance of RAB3A and GRIA1/GLUR1 in post-synaptic compartments in the forebrain and hippocampus (By similarity). Plays a role within the hematopoietic system in restricting inflammation and the development of autoimmunity (By similarity).
