UniprotID	Q9H5N1
Accession	Q9H5N1
EntryName	RABE2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rab GTPase-binding effector protein 2 (Rabaptin-5beta)
GeneName	RABEP2 RABPT5B
Length	569
Function	Plays a role in membrane trafficking and in homotypic early endosome fusion (PubMed:9524116). Participates in arteriogenesis by regulating vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2/VEGFR2 cell surface expression and endosomal trafficking (PubMed:29425100). By interacting with SDCCAG8, localizes to centrosomes and plays a critical role in ciliogenesis (PubMed:27224062).
