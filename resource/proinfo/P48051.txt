ProteinName	G protein-activated inward rectifier potassium channel 2 (GIRK-2) (BIR1) (Inward rectifier K(+) channel Kir3.2) (KATP-2) (Potassium channel, inwardly rectifying subfamily J member 6)
GeneName	KCNJ6 GIRK2 KATP2 KCNJ7
Length	423
Function	Inward rectifier potassium channels are characterized by a greater tendency to allow potassium to flow into the cell rather than out of it. Their voltage dependence is regulated by the concentration of extracellular potassium; as external potassium is raised, the voltage range of the channel opening shifts to more positive voltages. The inward rectification is mainly due to the blockage of outward current by internal magnesium. This potassium channel may be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion by glucose and/or neurotransmitters acting through G-protein-coupled receptors.
