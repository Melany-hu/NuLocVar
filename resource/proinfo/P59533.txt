UniprotID	P59533
Accession	P59533;A4D1U6;P59552;Q2M3E8;Q645W3;Q86UK3
EntryName	T2R38_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 38 (T2R38) (PTC bitter taste receptor) (Taste receptor type 2 member 61) (T2R61)
GeneName	TAS2R38 PTC
Length	333
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5 (By similarity).
