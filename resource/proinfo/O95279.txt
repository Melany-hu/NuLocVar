UniprotID	O95279
Accession	O95279;B2RAQ6;B5TJL2;Q5VV76
EntryName	KCNK5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Potassium channel subfamily K member 5 (Acid-sensitive potassium channel protein TASK-2) (TWIK-related acid-sensitive K(+) channel 2)
GeneName	KCNK5 TASK2
Length	499
Function	K(+) channel that conducts voltage-dependent outward rectifying currents upon membrane depolarization. Voltage sensing is coupled to K(+) electrochemical gradient in an 'ion flux gating' mode where outward but not inward ion flow opens the gate (PubMed:26919430, PubMed:36063992, PubMed:9812978). Homo- and heterodimerizes to form functional channels with distinct regulatory and gating properties (PubMed:36063992).
