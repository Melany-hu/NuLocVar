UniprotID	Q9Y2X8
Accession	Q9Y2X8;A4D1V0
EntryName	UB2D4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D4 (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme D4) (HBUCE1) (Ubiquitin carrier protein D4) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase D4)
GeneName	UBE2D4 UBCH5D
Length	147
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. In vitro able to promote polyubiquitination using all 7 ubiquitin Lys residues, but may prefer 'Lys-11' and 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination.
