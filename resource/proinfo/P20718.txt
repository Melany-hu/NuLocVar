UniprotID	P20718
Accession	P20718;G3V2C5;Q6XGZ0;Q6XGZ1
EntryName	GRAH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Granzyme H (EC 3.4.21.-) (CCP-X) (Cathepsin G-like 2) (CTSGL2) (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte proteinase) (Cytotoxic serine protease C) (CSP-C)
GeneName	GZMH CGL2 CTSGL2
Length	246
Function	Cytotoxic chymotrypsin-like serine protease with preference for bulky and aromatic residues at the P1 position and acidic residues at the P3' and P4' sites. Probably necessary for target cell lysis in cell-mediated immune responses. Participates in the antiviral response via direct cleavage of several proteins essential for viral replication.
Subcellular Location	Cytolytic granule
