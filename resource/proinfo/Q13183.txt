UniprotID	Q13183
Accession	Q13183;B2RBI9;B4DPL1;E7ETH5;Q4VAR7
EntryName	S13A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 13 member 2 (Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter 1) (NaDC-1) (Renal sodium/dicarboxylate cotransporter)
GeneName	SLC13A2 NADC1 SDCT1
Length	592
Function	Low-affinity sodium-dicarboxylate cotransporter, that mediates the entry of citric acid cycle intermediates, such as succinate, citrate, fumarate and alpha-ketoglutarate (2-oxoglutarate) into the small intestine and renal proximal tubule (PubMed:10894787, PubMed:8967342, PubMed:9668069). Transports the dicarboxylate into the cell with a probable stoichiometry of 3 Na(+) for 1 divalent dicarboxylate, rendering the process electrogenic (PubMed:10894787, PubMed:8967342, PubMed:9668069). Citrate is transported in protonated form as a divalent anion, rather than the trivalent form which is normally found in blood (PubMed:10894787). Has a critical role in renal dicarboxylate transport (By similarity).
