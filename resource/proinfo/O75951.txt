UniprotID	O75951
Accession	O75951;Q6UW30
EntryName	LYZL6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysozyme-like protein 6 (EC 3.2.1.17)
GeneName	LYZL6 LYC1 UNQ754/PRO1485
Length	148
Function	May be involved sperm-egg plasma membrane adhesion and fusion during fertilization (PubMed:28182716). Exhibits bacteriolytic activity in vitro against Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus (PubMed:24013621, PubMed:28182716). Shows weak bacteriolytic activity against Gram-positive bacteria at physiological pH (PubMed:28182716). Bacteriolytic activity is pH-dependent, with a maximum at around pH 5.6 (PubMed:28182716).
