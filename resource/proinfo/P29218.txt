EntryName	IMPA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMP 1) (IMPase 1) (EC 3.1.3.25) (D-galactose 1-phosphate phosphatase) (EC 3.1.3.94) (Inositol-1(or 4)-monophosphatase 1) (Lithium-sensitive myo-inositol monophosphatase A1)
GeneName	IMPA1 IMPA
Length	277
Function	Phosphatase involved in the dephosphorylation of myo-inositol monophosphates to generate myo-inositol (PubMed:17068342, PubMed:8718889, PubMed:9462881). Is also able to dephosphorylate scyllo-inositol-phosphate, myo-inositol 1,4-diphosphate, scyllo-inositol-1,3-diphosphate and scyllo-inositol-1,4-diphosphate (PubMed:17068342). Also dephosphorylates in vitro other sugar-phosphates including D-galactose-1-phosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-1-phosphate, beta-glycerophosphate and 2'-AMP (PubMed:17068342, PubMed:8718889, PubMed:9462881). Responsible for the provision of inositol required for synthesis of phosphatidylinositols and polyphosphoinositides, and involved in maintaining normal brain function (PubMed:26416544, PubMed:8718889). Has been implicated as the pharmacological target for lithium (Li(+)) action in brain, which is used to treat bipolar affective disorder (PubMed:17068342). Is equally active with 1D-myo-inositol 1-phosphate, 1D-myo-inositol 3-phosphate and D-galactose 1-phosphate (PubMed:9462881).
