UniprotID	Q92963
Accession	Q92963;B4DQE8;O00646;O00720;Q5VY89;Q5VY90
EntryName	RIT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	GTP-binding protein Rit1 (EC 3.6.5.2) (Ras-like protein expressed in many tissues) (Ras-like without CAAX protein 1)
GeneName	RIT1 RIBB RIT ROC1
Length	219
Function	Plays a crucial role in coupling NGF stimulation to the activation of both EPHB2 and MAPK14 signaling pathways and in NGF-dependent neuronal differentiation. Involved in ELK1 transactivation through the Ras-MAPK signaling cascade that mediates a wide variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.
