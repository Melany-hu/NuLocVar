UniprotID	P0C851
Accession	P0C851;B7Z648
EntryName	PIRT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphoinositide-interacting protein
GeneName	PIRT
Length	137
Function	Regulatory subunit of TRPV1, a molecular sensor of noxious heat and capsaicin. Positively regulates TRPV1 channel activity via phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Binds various phosphoinositide, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), but not phosphatidylinositol (PI) (By similarity).
