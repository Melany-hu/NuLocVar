EntryName	JKAMP_HUMAN
ProteinName	JNK1/MAPK8-associated membrane protein (JKAMP) (JNK1-associated membrane protein) (JAMP) (Medulloblastoma antigen MU-MB-50.4)
GeneName	JKAMP C14orf100 JAMP CDA06 HSPC213 HSPC327
Length	311
Function	Regulates the duration of MAPK8 activity in response to various stress stimuli (By similarity). Facilitates degradation of misfolded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins through the recruitment of components of the proteasome and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) system (PubMed:18784250).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
