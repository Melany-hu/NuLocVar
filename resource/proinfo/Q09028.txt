UniprotID	Q09028
Accession	Q09028;B2R6G9;B4DRH0;D3DPQ3;P31149;Q53H02;Q96BV9
EntryName	RBBP4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone-binding protein RBBP4 (Chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit C) (CAF-1 subunit C) (Chromatin assembly factor I p48 subunit) (CAF-I 48 kDa subunit) (CAF-I p48) (Nucleosome-remodeling factor subunit RBAP48) (Retinoblastoma-binding protein 4) (RBBP-4) (Retinoblastoma-binding protein p48)
GeneName	RBBP4 RBAP48
Length	425
Function	Core histone-binding subunit that may target chromatin assembly factors, chromatin remodeling factors and histone deacetylases to their histone substrates in a manner that is regulated by nucleosomal DNA. Component of several complexes which regulate chromatin metabolism. These include the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) complex, which is required for chromatin assembly following DNA replication and DNA repair; the core histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex, which promotes histone deacetylation and consequent transcriptional repression; the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex (the NuRD complex), which promotes transcriptional repression by histone deacetylation and nucleosome remodeling; the PRC2 complex, which promotes repression of homeotic genes during development; and the NURF (nucleosome remodeling factor) complex.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome; Telomere
