ProteinName	Acid ceramidase (AC) (ACDase) (Acid CDase) (EC 3.5.1.23) (Acylsphingosine deacylase) (Glycosylceramide deacylase) (EC 3.5.1.109) (N-acylethanolamine hydrolase ASAH1) (EC 3.5.1.-) (N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase) (Putative 32 kDa heart protein) (PHP32) [Cleaved into: Acid ceramidase subunit alpha; Acid ceramidase subunit beta]
GeneName	ASAH1 ASAH HSD-33 HSD33
Length	395
Function	Lysosomal ceramidase that hydrolyzes sphingolipid ceramides into sphingosine and free fatty acids at acidic pH (PubMed:10610716, PubMed:11451951, PubMed:15655246, PubMed:26898341, PubMed:36752535, PubMed:7744740, PubMed:7852294). Ceramides, sphingosine, and its phosphorylated form sphingosine-1-phosphate are bioactive lipids that mediate cellular signaling pathways regulating several biological processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation (PubMed:10610716). Has a higher catalytic efficiency towards C12-ceramides versus other ceramides (PubMed:15655246, PubMed:7744740). Also catalyzes the reverse reaction allowing the synthesis of ceramides from fatty acids and sphingosine (PubMed:12764132, PubMed:12815059). For the reverse synthetic reaction, the natural sphingosine D-erythro isomer is more efficiently utilized as a substrate compared to D-erythro-dihydrosphingosine and D-erythro-phytosphingosine, while the fatty acids with chain lengths of 12 or 14 carbons are the most efficiently used (PubMed:12764132). Also has an N-acylethanolamine hydrolase activity (PubMed:15655246). By regulating the levels of ceramides, sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate in the epidermis, mediates the calcium-induced differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes (PubMed:17713573). Also indirectly regulates tumor necrosis factor/TNF-induced apoptosis (By similarity). By regulating the intracellular balance between ceramides and sphingosine, in adrenocortical cells, probably also acts as a regulator of steroidogenesis (PubMed:22261821).
