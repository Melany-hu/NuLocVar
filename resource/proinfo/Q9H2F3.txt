ProteinName	3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type VII) (3-beta-HSD VII) (3-beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-C27 steroid oxidoreductase) (C(27) 3-beta-HSD) (EC 1.1.1.-) (Cholest-5-ene-3-beta,7-alpha-diol 3-beta-dehydrogenase) (EC 1.1.1.181)
GeneName	HSD3B7
Length	369
Function	The 3-beta-HSD enzymatic system plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids. HSD VII is active against four 7-alpha-hydroxylated sterols. Does not metabolize several different C(19/21) steroids as substrates. Involved in bile acid synthesis (PubMed:11067870). Plays a key role in cell positioning and movement in lymphoid tissues by mediating degradation of 7-alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7-alpha,25-OHC): 7-alpha,25-OHC acts as a ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor GPR183/EBI2, a chemotactic receptor for a number of lymphoid cells (By similarity).
