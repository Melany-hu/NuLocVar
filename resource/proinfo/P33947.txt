UniprotID	P33947
Accession	P33947;A4D2P4;Q6IPC5;Q96E30
EntryName	ERD22_HUMAN
ProteinName	ER lumen protein-retaining receptor 2 (ERD2-like protein 1) (ELP-1) (KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 2) (KDEL receptor 2)
GeneName	KDELR2 ERD2.2
Length	212
Function	Membrane receptor that binds the K-D-E-L sequence motif in the C-terminal part of endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins and maintains their localization in that compartment by participating to their vesicle-mediated recycling back from the Golgi (PubMed:1325562, PubMed:18086916, PubMed:33053334). Binding is pH dependent, and is optimal at pH 5-5.4 (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle; COPI-coated vesicle membrane
