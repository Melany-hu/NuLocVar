UniprotID	Q4G0X4
Accession	Q4G0X4;B4DTR0
EntryName	KCD21_HUMAN
ProteinName	BTB/POZ domain-containing protein KCTD21 (KCASH2 protein) (Potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 21)
GeneName	KCTD21
Length	260
Function	Probable substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex mediating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Promotes the ubiquitination of HDAC1. Can function as antagonist of the Hedgehog pathway by affecting the nuclear transfer of transcription factor GLI1; the function probably occurs via HDAC1 down-regulation, keeping GLI1 acetylated and inactive. Inhibits cell growth and tumorigenicity of medulloblastoma (MDB) (PubMed:21472142).
