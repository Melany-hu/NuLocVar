UniprotID	Q96SN7
Accession	Q96SN7;Q6IA68;Q8WY94;Q9H9Y3
EntryName	ORAI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein orai-2 (CAP-binding protein complex-interacting protein 2) (Transmembrane protein 142B)
GeneName	ORAI2 C7orf19 CBCIP2 TMEM142B PP1729
Length	254
Function	Pore-forming subunit of inward rectifying Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels. Assembles with ORAI1 and ORAI3 to form hexameric CRAC channels that mediate Ca(2+) influx upon depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) store and channel activation by Ca(2+) sensor STIM1, a process known as store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). Various pore subunit combinations may account for distinct CRAC channel spatiotemporal and cell-type specific dynamics. ORAI1 mainly contributes to the generation of Ca(2+) plateaus involved in sustained Ca(2+) entry and is dispensable for cytosolic Ca(2+) oscillations, whereas ORAI2 and ORAI3 generate oscillatory patterns. CRAC channels assemble in Ca(2+) signaling microdomains where Ca(2+) influx is coupled to calmodulin and calcineurin signaling and activation of NFAT transcription factors recruited to ORAI1 via AKAP5. CRAC channels are the main pathway for Ca(2+) influx in T cells and promote the immune response to pathogens by activating NFAT-dependent cytokine and chemokine transcription.
