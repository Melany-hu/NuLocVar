EntryName	TADA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcriptional adapter 3 (ADA3 homolog) (hADA3) (STAF54) (Transcriptional adapter 3-like) (ADA3-like protein)
GeneName	TADA3 ADA3 TADA3L
Length	432
Function	Functions as a component of the PCAF complex. The PCAF complex is capable of efficiently acetylating histones in a nucleosomal context. The PCAF complex could be considered as the human version of the yeast SAGA complex. Also known as a coactivator for p53/TP53-dependent transcriptional activation. Component of the ATAC complex, a complex with histone acetyltransferase activity on histones H3 and H4.
