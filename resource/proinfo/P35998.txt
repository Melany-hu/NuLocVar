UniprotID	P35998
Accession	P35998;A4D0Q1;B7Z5E2;Q3LIA5;Q9UDI3
EntryName	PRS7_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome regulatory subunit 7 (26S proteasome AAA-ATPase subunit RPT1) (Proteasome 26S subunit ATPase 2)
GeneName	PSMC2 MSS1
Length	433
Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair. PSMC2 belongs to the heterohexameric ring of AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) proteins that unfolds ubiquitinated target proteins that are concurrently translocated into a proteolytic chamber and degraded into peptides.
