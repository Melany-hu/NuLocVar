ProteinName	Adenylosuccinate synthetase isozyme 1 (AMPSase 1) (AdSS 1) (EC 6.3.4.4) (Adenylosuccinate synthetase, basic isozyme) (Adenylosuccinate synthetase, muscle isozyme) (M-type adenylosuccinate synthetase) (Adenylosuccinate synthetase-like 1) (AdSSL1) (IMP--aspartate ligase 1)
GeneName	ADSS1 ADSSL1
Length	457
Function	Component of the purine nucleotide cycle (PNC), which interconverts IMP and AMP to regulate the nucleotide levels in various tissues, and which contributes to glycolysis and ammoniagenesis. Catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of AMP from IMP.
