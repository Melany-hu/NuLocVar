UniprotID	O43813
Accession	O43813
EntryName	LANC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutathione S-transferase LANCL1 (EC 2.5.1.18) (40 kDa erythrocyte membrane protein) (p40) (LanC-like protein 1)
GeneName	LANCL1 GPR69A
Length	399
Function	Functions as a glutathione transferase. Catalyzes conjugation of the glutathione (GSH) to artificial substrates 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and p-nitrophenyl acetate. Mitigates neuronal oxidative stress during normal postnatal development and in response to oxidative stresses probably through GSH antioxidant defense mechanism (By similarity). May play a role in EPS8 signaling. Binds glutathione (PubMed:19528316).
