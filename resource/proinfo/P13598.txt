UniprotID	P13598
Accession	P13598;Q14600
EntryName	ICAM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM-2) (CD antigen CD102)
GeneName	ICAM2
Length	275
Function	ICAM proteins are ligands for the leukocyte adhesion protein LFA-1 (integrin alpha-L/beta-2). ICAM2 may play a role in lymphocyte recirculation by blocking LFA-1-dependent cell adhesion. It mediates adhesive interactions important for antigen-specific immune response, NK-cell mediated clearance, lymphocyte recirculation, and other cellular interactions important for immune response and surveillance.
