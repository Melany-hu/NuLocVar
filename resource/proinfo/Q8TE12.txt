Accession	Q8TE12;B3KXP6;Q0VDB5;Q5VWG4;Q8TE11
EntryName	LMX1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	LIM homeobox transcription factor 1-alpha (LIM/homeobox protein 1.1) (LMX-1.1) (LIM/homeobox protein LMX1A)
GeneName	LMX1A
Length	382
Function	Acts as a transcriptional activator by binding to an A/T-rich sequence, the FLAT element, in the insulin gene promoter. Required for development of the roof plate and, in turn, for specification of dorsal cell fates in the CNS and developing vertebrae (By similarity).
