UniprotID	Q9UI43
Accession	Q9UI43;Q24JR8
EntryName	MRM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	rRNA methyltransferase 2, mitochondrial (EC 2.1.1.-) (16S rRNA (uridine(1369)-2'-O)-methyltransferase) (16S rRNA [Um1369] 2'-O-methyltransferase) (Protein ftsJ homolog 2)
GeneName	MRM2 FJH1 FTSJ2
Length	246
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of 2'-O-methyluridine at position 1369 (Um1369) in the 16S mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSU rRNA), a universally conserved modification in the peptidyl transferase domain of the mtLSU rRNA (PubMed:25009282, PubMed:25074936, PubMed:35177605). This activity may require prior 2'-O-methylguanosine modification at position 1370 (Gm1370) by MRM3 (PubMed:35177605). Essential for late-stage assembly of mtLSU required for efficient translation of mitochondrial DNA encoded proteins; methyltransferase activity is not required for this function (PubMed:35177605). Essential for mitochondrial respiratory function (PubMed:35177605).
