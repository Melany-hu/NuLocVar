UniprotID	P11168
Accession	P11168;A8K481;B2R936;B7Z547;F8W8V8;Q9UCW9
EntryName	GTR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 2, facilitated glucose transporter member 2 (Glucose transporter type 2, liver) (GLUT-2)
GeneName	SLC2A2 GLUT2
Length	524
Function	Facilitative hexose transporter that mediates the transport of glucose, fructose and galactose (PubMed:16186102, PubMed:23396969, PubMed:28083649, PubMed:8027028, PubMed:8457197). Likely mediates the bidirectional transfer of glucose across the plasma membrane of hepatocytes and is responsible for uptake of glucose by the beta cells; may comprise part of the glucose-sensing mechanism of the beta cell (PubMed:8027028). May also participate with the Na(+)/glucose cotransporter in the transcellular transport of glucose in the small intestine and kidney (PubMed:3399500). Also able to mediate the transport of dehydroascorbate (PubMed:23396969).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
