UniprotID	P78346
Accession	P78346;B2R799;E9PB02
EntryName	RPP30_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease P protein subunit p30 (RNaseP protein p30) (RNase P subunit 2)
GeneName	RPP30 RNASEP2
Length	268
Function	Component of ribonuclease P, a ribonucleoprotein complex that generates mature tRNA molecules by cleaving their 5'-ends (PubMed:30454648, PubMed:9037013, PubMed:9630247). Also a component of the MRP ribonuclease complex, which cleaves pre-rRNA sequences (PubMed:28115465).
