Function	Involved in pinching off the separated nuclei at the cleavage furrow and in cytokinesis (PubMed:20107318). Required for mitotic integrity and maintenance of chromosomal stability. Protects cells against mitotic errors, centrosomal amplification, micronucleus formation and aneuploidy. Plays a key role of midbody function involving abscission of the daughter cells during cytokinesis and appropriate chromosomal and nuclear segregation into the daughter cells (PubMed:22988245, PubMed:23713010).
