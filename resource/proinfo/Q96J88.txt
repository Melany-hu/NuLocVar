UniprotID	Q96J88
Accession	Q96J88;Q8IVC7;Q8NDQ7
EntryName	ESIP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Epithelial-stromal interaction protein 1
GeneName	EPSTI1
Length	318
Function	Plays a role in M1 macrophage polarization and is required for the proper regulation of gene expression during M1 versus M2 macrophage differentiation (By similarity). Might play a role in RELA/p65 and STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear localization upon activation of macrophages (By similarity).
