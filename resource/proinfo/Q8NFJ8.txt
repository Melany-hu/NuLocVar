UniprotID	Q8NFJ8
Accession	Q8NFJ8
EntryName	BHE22_HUMAN
ProteinName	Class E basic helix-loop-helix protein 22 (bHLHe22) (Class B basic helix-loop-helix protein 5) (bHLHb5) (Trinucleotide repeat-containing gene 20 protein)
GeneName	BHLHE22 BHLHB5 TNRC20
Length	381
Function	Inhibits DNA binding of TCF3/E47 homodimers and TCF3 (E47)/NEUROD1 heterodimers and acts as a strong repressor of Neurod1 and Myod-responsive genes, probably by heterodimerization with class a basic helix-loop-helix factors. Despite the presence of an intact basic domain, does not bind to DNA (By similarity). In the brain, may function as an area-specific transcription factor that regulates the postmitotic acquisition of area identities and elucidate the genetic hierarchy between progenitors and postmitotic neurons driving neocortical arealization. May be required for the survival of a specific population of inhibitory neurons in the superficial laminae of the spinal cord dorsal horn that may regulate pruritis. Seems to play a crucial role in the retinogenesis, in the specification of amacrine and bipolar subtypes. Forms with PRDM8 a transcriptional repressor complex controlling genes involved in neural development and neuronal differentiation.
