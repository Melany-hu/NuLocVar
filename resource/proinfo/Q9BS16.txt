UniprotID	Q9BS16
Accession	Q9BS16;Q9H4L0
EntryName	CENPK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Centromere protein K (CENP-K) (Interphase centromere complex protein 37) (Protein AF-5alpha) (p33)
GeneName	CENPK ICEN37 FKSG14
Length	269
Function	Component of the CENPA-CAD (nucleosome distal) complex, a complex recruited to centromeres which is involved in assembly of kinetochore proteins, mitotic progression and chromosome segregation. May be involved in incorporation of newly synthesized CENPA into centromeres via its interaction with the CENPA-NAC complex. Acts in coordination with KNL1 to recruit the NDC80 complex to the outer kinetochore.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome; Centromere; Chromosome; Centromere; Kinetochore
