UniprotID	P14222
Accession	P14222;B2R6X4;Q59F57;Q86WX7
EntryName	PERF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Perforin-1 (P1) (Cytolysin) (Lymphocyte pore-forming protein) (PFP)
GeneName	PRF1 PFP
Length	555
Function	Pore-forming protein that plays a key role in granzyme-mediated programmed cell death, and in defense against virus-infected or neoplastic cells (PubMed:20889983, PubMed:21037563, PubMed:24558045, PubMed:9058810, PubMed:9164947). Plays an important role in killing other cells that are recognized as non-self by the immune system, e.g. in transplant rejection or some forms of autoimmune disease (PubMed:9058810). Can insert into the membrane of target cells in its calcium-bound form, oligomerize and form large pores (PubMed:20889983, PubMed:21037563). Promotes cytolysis and apoptosis of target cells by mediating the passage and uptake of cytotoxic granzymes (PubMed:20038786, PubMed:20225066, PubMed:24558045, PubMed:32299851). Facilitates the delivery of cationic cargo protein, while anionic or neural proteins are not delivered efficiently (PubMed:24558045). Perforin pores allow the release of mature caspase-7 (CASP7) into the extracellular milieu (By similarity).
