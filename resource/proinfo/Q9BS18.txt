UniprotID	Q9BS18
Accession	Q9BS18;Q9Y3V0
EntryName	APC13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 13 (APC13) (Cyclosome subunit 13)
GeneName	ANAPC13
Length	74
Function	Component of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a cell cycle-regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls progression through mitosis and the G1 phase of the cell cycle (PubMed:15060174, PubMed:18485873). The APC/C complex acts by mediating ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins: it mainly mediates the formation of 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitin chains and, to a lower extent, the formation of 'Lys-48'- and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:15060174, PubMed:18485873). The APC/C complex catalyzes assembly of branched 'Lys-11'-/'Lys-48'-linked branched ubiquitin chains on target proteins (PubMed:29033132).
