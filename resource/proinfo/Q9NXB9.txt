UniprotID	Q9NXB9
Accession	Q9NXB9;Q6P9E1;Q86W94
EntryName	ELOV2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Very long chain fatty acid elongase 2 (EC 2.3.1.199) (3-keto acyl-CoA synthase ELOVL2) (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2) (ELOVL FA elongase 2) (Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 2) (Very long chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 2) (Very long chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA synthase 2)
GeneName	ELOVL2 ELG3 SSC2
Length	296
Function	Catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction of the four reactions that constitute the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle. This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process allows the addition of 2 carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) per cycle. Condensing enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of polyunsaturated very long chain fatty acid (C20- and C22-PUFA), acting specifically toward polyunsaturated acyl-CoA with the higher activity toward C20:4(n-6) acyl-CoA. May participate in the production of polyunsaturated VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
