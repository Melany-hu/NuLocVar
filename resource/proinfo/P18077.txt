UniprotID	P18077
Accession	P18077;Q08ES9;Q9BVN7
EntryName	RL35A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein eL33 (60S ribosomal protein L35a) (Cell growth-inhibiting gene 33 protein)
GeneName	RPL35A GIG33
Length	110
Function	Component of the large ribosomal subunit (PubMed:23636399, PubMed:32669547). The ribosome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell (PubMed:23636399, PubMed:32669547). Required for the proliferation and viability of hematopoietic cells (PubMed:18535205).
