UniprotID	P35227
Accession	P35227;A6NGD8
EntryName	PCGF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polycomb group RING finger protein 2 (DNA-binding protein Mel-18) (RING finger protein 110) (Zinc finger protein 144)
GeneName	PCGF2 MEL18 RNF110 ZNF144
Length	344
Function	Transcriptional repressor. Binds specifically to the DNA sequence 5'-GACTNGACT-3'. Has tumor suppressor activity. May play a role in control of cell proliferation and/or neural cell development. Regulates proliferation of early T progenitor cells by maintaining expression of HES1. Also plays a role in antero-posterior specification of the axial skeleton and negative regulation of the self-renewal activity of hematopoietic stem cells (By similarity). Component of a Polycomb group (PcG) multiprotein PRC1-like complex, a complex class required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of many genes, including Hox genes, throughout development. PcG PRC1 complex acts via chromatin remodeling and modification of histones; it mediates monoubiquitination of histone H2A 'Lys-119', rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility (PubMed:26151332). Within the PRC1-like complex, regulates RNF2 ubiquitin ligase activity (PubMed:26151332).
