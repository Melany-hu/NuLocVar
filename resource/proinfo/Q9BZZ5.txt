UniprotID	Q9BZZ5
Accession	Q9BZZ5;B4DGR0;B4DRJ2;B4E283;D3DR21;G3V1C3;O15441;Q9Y4J7
EntryName	API5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Apoptosis inhibitor 5 (API-5) (Antiapoptosis clone 11 protein) (AAC-11) (Cell migration-inducing gene 8 protein) (Fibroblast growth factor 2-interacting factor) (FIF) (Protein XAGL)
GeneName	API5 MIG8
Length	524
Function	Antiapoptotic factor that may have a role in protein assembly. Negatively regulates ACIN1. By binding to ACIN1, it suppresses ACIN1 cleavage from CASP3 and ACIN1-mediated DNA fragmentation. Also known to efficiently suppress E2F1-induced apoptosis. Its depletion enhances the cytotoxic action of the chemotherapeutic drugs.
