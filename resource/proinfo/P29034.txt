UniprotID	P29034
Accession	P29034;O00266;Q3KRB9;Q5RHS8;Q9BU83
EntryName	S10A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein S100-A2 (CAN19) (Protein S-100L) (S100 calcium-binding protein A2)
GeneName	S100A2 S100L
Length	98
Function	May function as calcium sensor and modulator, contributing to cellular calcium signaling. May function by interacting with other proteins, such as TPR-containing proteins, and indirectly play a role in many physiological processes. May also play a role in suppressing tumor cell growth.
