UniprotID	P43487-2
Accession	P43487;Q53EY3
EntryName	RANG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ran-specific GTPase-activating protein (Ran-binding protein 1) (RanBP1)
GeneName	RANBP1
Length	200
Function	Plays a role in RAN-dependent nucleocytoplasmic transport. Alleviates the TNPO1-dependent inhibition of RAN GTPase activity and mediates the dissociation of RAN from proteins involved in transport into the nucleus (By similarity). Induces a conformation change in the complex formed by XPO1 and RAN that triggers the release of the nuclear export signal of cargo proteins (PubMed:20485264). Promotes the disassembly of the complex formed by RAN and importin beta. Promotes dissociation of RAN from a complex with KPNA2 and CSE1L (By similarity). Required for normal mitotic spindle assembly and normal progress through mitosis via its effect on RAN (PubMed:17671426). Does not increase the RAN GTPase activity by itself, but increases GTP hydrolysis mediated by RANGAP1 (PubMed:7882974). Inhibits RCC1-dependent exchange of RAN-bound GDP by GTP (PubMed:7616957, PubMed:7882974).
