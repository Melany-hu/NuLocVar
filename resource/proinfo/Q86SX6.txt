UniprotID	Q86SX6
Accession	Q86SX6;Q0X088;Q3YML0;Q86WY3;Q8IZ54
EntryName	GLRX5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutaredoxin-related protein 5, mitochondrial (Monothiol glutaredoxin-5)
GeneName	GLRX5 C14orf87
Length	157
Function	Monothiol glutaredoxin involved in mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster transfer (PubMed:20364084, PubMed:23615440). Receives 2Fe/2S clusters from scaffold protein ISCU and mediates their transfer to apoproteins, to the 4Fe/FS cluster biosynthesis machinery, or export from mitochondrion (PubMed:20364084, PubMed:23615440, PubMed:24334290). Required for normal regulation of hemoglobin synthesis by the iron-sulfur protein ACO1 (PubMed:20364084).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion matrix
