UniprotID	Q9NQZ2
Accession	Q9NQZ2;Q6FI82
EntryName	SAS10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Something about silencing protein 10 (Charged amino acid-rich leucine zipper 1) (CRL1) (Disrupter of silencing SAS10) (UTP3 homolog)
GeneName	UTP3 CRLZ1 SAS10
Length	479
Function	Essential for gene silencing: has a role in the structure of silenced chromatin. Plays a role in the developing brain (By similarity). Part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, first precursor of the small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit. During the assembly of the SSU processome in the nucleolus, many ribosome biogenesis factors, an RNA chaperone and ribosomal proteins associate with the nascent pre-rRNA and work in concert to generate RNA folding, modifications, rearrangements and cleavage as well as targeted degradation of pre-ribosomal RNA by the RNA exosome (PubMed:34516797).
