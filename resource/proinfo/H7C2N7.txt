UniprotID	H7C2N7
Accession	H7C2N7
EntryName	H7C2N7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prolactin regulatory element-binding protein (Mammalian guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sec12)
GeneName	PREB
Length	106
Function	Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that regulates the assembly of the coat protein complex II/COPII in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport. Selectively activates SAR1A and SAR1B by promoting the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in these small GTPases. In their activated GTP-bound state, SAR1A and SAR1B insert into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum where they recruit the remainder of the coat protein complex II/COPII which is responsible for both the sorting of proteins and the deformation and budding of membranes into vesicles destined to the Golgi.
