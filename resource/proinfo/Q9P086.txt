UniprotID	Q9P086
Accession	Q9P086;Q6NS89
EntryName	MED11_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 11 (Mediator complex subunit 11)
GeneName	MED11 HSPC296
Length	117
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for theee assembly of a functional pre-initiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
