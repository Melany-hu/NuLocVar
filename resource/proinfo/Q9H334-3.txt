Accession	Q9H334;A3QVP8;B3KV70;G5E9V8;Q8NAN6;Q9BSG9;Q9H332;Q9H333;Q9P0R1
EntryName	FOXP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Forkhead box protein P1 (Mac-1-regulated forkhead) (MFH)
GeneName	FOXP1 HSPC215
Length	603
Function	Transcriptional repressor (PubMed:18347093, PubMed:26647308). Can act with CTBP1 to synergistically repress transcription but CTPBP1 is not essential (By similarity). Plays an important role in the specification and differentiation of lung epithelium. Acts cooperatively with FOXP4 to regulate lung secretory epithelial cell fate and regeneration by restricting the goblet cell lineage program; the function may involve regulation of AGR2. Essential transcriptional regulator of B-cell development. Involved in regulation of cardiac muscle cell proliferation. Involved in the columnar organization of spinal motor neurons. Promotes the formation of the lateral motor neuron column (LMC) and the preganglionic motor column (PGC) and is required for respective appropriate motor axon projections. The segment-appropriate generation of spinal cord motor columns requires cooperation with other Hox proteins. Can regulate PITX3 promoter activity; may promote midbrain identity in embryonic stem cell-derived dopamine neurons by regulating PITX3. Negatively regulates the differentiation of T follicular helper cells T(FH)s. Involved in maintenance of hair follicle stem cell quiescence; the function probably involves regulation of FGF18 (By similarity). Represses transcription of various pro-apoptotic genes and cooperates with NF-kappa B-signaling in promoting B-cell expansion by inhibition of caspase-dependent apoptosis (PubMed:25267198). Binds to CSF1R promoter elements and is involved in regulation of monocyte differentiation and macrophage functions; repression of CSF1R in monocytes seems to involve NCOR2 as corepressor (PubMed:15286807, PubMed:18347093, PubMed:18799727). Involved in endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation and migration indicative for a role in angiogenesis; the role in neovascularization seems to implicate suppression of SEMA5B (PubMed:24023716). Can negatively regulate androgen receptor signaling (PubMed:18640093). Acts as a transcriptional activator of the FBXL7 promoter; this activity is regulated by AURKA (PubMed:28218735).
