UniprotID	Q9NWM8
Accession	Q9NWM8
EntryName	FKB14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP14 (PPIase FKBP14) (EC 5.2.1.8) (22 kDa FK506-binding protein) (22 kDa FKBP) (FKBP-22) (FK506-binding protein 14) (FKBP-14) (Rotamase)
GeneName	FKBP14 FKBP22 UNQ322/PRO381
Length	211
Function	PPIase which accelerates the folding of proteins during protein synthesis. Has a preference for substrates containing 4-hydroxylproline modifications, including type III collagen. May also target type VI and type X collagens.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum lumen
