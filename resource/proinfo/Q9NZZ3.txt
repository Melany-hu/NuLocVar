Accession	Q9NZZ3;B2RD95;B4DIR6;Q5VXW2;Q96AV2;Q9HB68;Q9NYS4;Q9Y323
EntryName	CHMP5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Charged multivesicular body protein 5 (Chromatin-modifying protein 5) (SNF7 domain-containing protein 2) (Vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 60) (Vps60) (hVps60)
GeneName	CHMP5 C9orf83 SNF7DC2 CGI-34 HSPC177 PNAS-114 PNAS-2
Length	219
Function	Probable peripherally associated component of the endosomal sorting required for transport complex III (ESCRT-III) which is involved in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis and the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses) (PubMed:14519844). ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. Involved in HIV-1 p6- and p9-dependent virus release (PubMed:14519844).
