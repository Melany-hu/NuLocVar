UniprotID	Q16772
Accession	Q16772;O43468;Q068V6;Q8WWA8;Q9H415
EntryName	GSTA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutathione S-transferase A3 (EC 2.5.1.18) (GST class-alpha member 3) (Glutathione S-transferase A3-3)
GeneName	GSTA3
Length	222
Function	Conjugation of reduced glutathione to a wide number of exogenous and endogenous hydrophobic electrophiles. Catalyzes isomerization reactions that contribute to the biosynthesis of steroid hormones. Efficiently catalyze obligatory double-bond isomerizations of delta(5)-androstene-3,17-dione and delta(5)-pregnene-3,20-dione, precursors to testosterone and progesterone, respectively. Has substantial activity toward aflatoxin B1-8,9-epoxide (By similarity).
