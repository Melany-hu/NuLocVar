UniprotID	Q9NR12
Accession	Q9NR12;Q14250;Q5XG82;Q6NVZ5;Q96C91;Q9BXB8;Q9BXB9
EntryName	PDLI7_HUMAN
ProteinName	PDZ and LIM domain protein 7 (LIM mineralization protein) (LMP) (Protein enigma)
GeneName	PDLIM7 ENIGMA
Length	457
Function	May function as a scaffold on which the coordinated assembly of proteins can occur. May play a role as an adapter that, via its PDZ domain, localizes LIM-binding proteins to actin filaments of both skeletal muscle and nonmuscle tissues. Involved in both of the two fundamental mechanisms of bone formation, direct bone formation (e.g. embryonic flat bones mandible and cranium), and endochondral bone formation (e.g. embryonic long bone development). Plays a role during fracture repair. Involved in BMP6 signaling pathway (By similarity).
