UniprotID	Q13487
Accession	Q13487;B2RBZ6;D6W663;Q13486
EntryName	SNPC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	snRNA-activating protein complex subunit 2 (SNAPc subunit 2) (Proximal sequence element-binding transcription factor subunit delta) (PSE-binding factor subunit delta) (PTF subunit delta) (Small nuclear RNA-activating complex polypeptide 2) (snRNA-activating protein complex 45 kDa subunit) (SNAPc 45 kDa subunit)
GeneName	SNAPC2 SNAP45
Length	334
Function	Part of the SNAPc complex required for the transcription of both RNA polymerase II and III small-nuclear RNA genes. Binds to the proximal sequence element (PSE), a non-TATA-box basal promoter element common to these 2 types of genes. Recruits TBP and BRF2 to the U6 snRNA TATA box.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
