UniprotID	O15403
Accession	O15403;Q6P1X3
EntryName	MOT7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Monocarboxylate transporter 7 (MCT 7) (Monocarboxylate transporter 6) (MCT 6) (Solute carrier family 16 member 6)
GeneName	SLC16A6 MCT6 MCT7
Length	523
Function	Monocarboxylate transporter selective for taurine. May associate with BSG/CD147 or EMB/GP70 ancillary proteins to mediate facilitative efflux or influx of taurine across the plasma membrane. The transport is pH- and sodium-independent. Rather low-affinity, is likely effective for taurine transport in tissues where taurine is present at high concentrations.
Subcellular Location	Basolateral cell membrane
