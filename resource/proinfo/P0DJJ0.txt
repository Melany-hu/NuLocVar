UniprotID	P0DJJ0
Accession	P0DJJ0
EntryName	SRG2C_HUMAN
ProteinName	SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase-activating protein 2C (SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase activating protein 2 pseudogene 1)
GeneName	SRGAP2C SRGAP2P1
Length	459
Function	Human-specific protein that acts as a key modifier of cortical connectivity in the human brain (PubMed:22559944, PubMed:27373832, PubMed:34707291). Acts by inhibiting the functions of ancestral paralog SRGAP2/SRGAP2A, a postsynaptic protein that regulates excitatory and inhibitory synapse maturation and density in cortical pyramidal neurons (PubMed:22559944, PubMed:27373832). SRGAP2C is unstable but is able to heterodimerize with SRGAP2/SRGAP2A, thereby reducing SRGAP2/SRGAP2A levels through proteasome-dependent degradation (PubMed:27373832, PubMed:28333212, PubMed:31822692). Inhibition of SRGAP2/SRGAP2A by SRGAP2C leads to an increase in synaptic density and protracted synaptic maturation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (PubMed:27373832, PubMed:34707291). Modifies cortical circuit connectivity by increasing the number of local and long-range cortical inputs received by layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PubMed:34707291). Also able to increase the probability of sensory-evoked responses by layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PubMed:34707291).
