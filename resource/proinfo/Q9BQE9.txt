UniprotID	Q9BQE9
Accession	Q9BQE9;A8K226;C9JWD3;D3DXF0;O43769;Q13845;Q6ZW75
EntryName	BCL7B_HUMAN
ProteinName	B-cell CLL/lymphoma 7 protein family member B (allergen Hom s 3)
GeneName	BCL7B
Length	202
Function	Positive regulator of apoptosis. Plays a role in the Wnt signaling pathway, negatively regulating the expression of Wnt signaling components CTNNB1 and HMGA1 (PubMed:25569233). Involved in cell cycle progression, maintenance of the nuclear structure and stem cell differentiation (PubMed:25569233). May play a role in lung tumor development or progression (By similarity).
