EntryName	MARC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component 2 (mARC2) (EC 1.7.-.-) (Molybdenum cofactor sulfurase C-terminal domain-containing protein 2) (MOSC domain-containing protein 2) (Moco sulfurase C-terminal domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	MTARC2 MARC2 MOSC2
Length	335
Function	Catalyzes the reduction of N-oxygenated molecules, acting as a counterpart of cytochrome P450 and flavin-containing monooxygenases in metabolic cycles (PubMed:21029045, PubMed:24423752). As a component of prodrug-converting system, reduces a multitude of N-hydroxylated prodrugs particularly amidoximes, leading to increased drug bioavailability (PubMed:21029045, PubMed:24423752). May be involved in mitochondrial N(omega)-hydroxy-L-arginine (NOHA) reduction, regulating endogenous nitric oxide levels and biosynthesis (PubMed:21029045). Postulated to cleave the N-OH bond of N-hydroxylated substrates in concert with electron transfer from NADH to cytochrome b5 reductase then to cytochrome b5, the ultimate electron donor that primes the active site for substrate reduction (PubMed:21029045).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane; Peroxisome
