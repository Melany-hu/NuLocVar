UniprotID	P08833
Accession	P08833;A4D2F4;D3DVL9;Q8IYP5
EntryName	IBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IBP-1) (IGF-binding protein 1) (IGFBP-1) (Placental protein 12) (PP12)
GeneName	IGFBP1 IBP1
Length	259
Function	Multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in regulating the availability of IGFs such as IGF1 and IGF2 to their receptors and thereby regulates IGF-mediated cellular processes including cell migration, proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis in a cell-type specific manner (PubMed:11397844, PubMed:15972819). Also plays a positive role in cell migration by interacting with integrin ITGA5:ITGB1 through its RGD motif (PubMed:7504269). Mechanistically, binding to integrins leads to activation of focal adhesion kinase/PTK2 and stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (PubMed:11397844). Regulates cardiomyocyte apoptosis by suppressing HIF-1alpha/HIF1A ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (By similarity).
