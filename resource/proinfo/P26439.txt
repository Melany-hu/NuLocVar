ProteinName	3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta 5-->4-isomerase type 2 (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/Delta 5-->4-isomerase type II) (3-beta-HSD II) (3-beta-HSD adrenal and gonadal type) [Includes: 3-beta-hydroxy-Delta(5)-steroid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.145) (3-beta-hydroxy-5-ene steroid dehydrogenase) (Progesterone reductase); Steroid Delta-isomerase (EC 5.3.3.1) (Delta-5-3-ketosteroid isomerase)]
GeneName	HSD3B2 HSDB3B
Length	372
Function	3-beta-HSD is a bifunctional enzyme, that catalyzes the oxidative conversion of Delta(5)-ene-3-beta-hydroxy steroid, and the oxidative conversion of ketosteroids. The 3-beta-HSD enzymatic system plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids.
