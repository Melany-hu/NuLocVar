EntryName	CP2B6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 2B6 (EC 1.14.13.-) (1,4-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase) (CYPIIB6) (Cytochrome P450 IIB1)
GeneName	CYP2B6
Length	491
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of endocannabinoids and steroids (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:21289075). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) to 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ethanolamides (EpETrE-EAs), potentially modulating endocannabinoid system signaling (PubMed:21289075). Hydroxylates steroid hormones, including testosterone at C-16 and estrogens at C-2 (PubMed:12865317, PubMed:21289075). Plays a role in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics, including plant lipids and drugs (PubMed:11695850, PubMed:22909231). Acts as a 1,4-cineole 2-exo-monooxygenase (PubMed:11695850).
