EntryName	SIK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine/threonine-protein kinase SIK1 (EC 2.7.11.1) (Salt-inducible kinase 1) (SIK-1) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase SNF1-like kinase 1) (Serine/threonine-protein kinase SNF1LK)
GeneName	SIK1 SIK SNF1LK
Length	783
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in various processes such as cell cycle regulation, gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis regulation, muscle growth and differentiation and tumor suppression. Phosphorylates HDAC4, HDAC5, PPME1, SREBF1, CRTC1/TORC1. Inhibits CREB activity by phosphorylating and inhibiting activity of TORCs, the CREB-specific coactivators, like CRTC2/TORC2 and CRTC3/TORC3 in response to cAMP signaling (PubMed:29211348). Acts as a tumor suppressor and plays a key role in p53/TP53-dependent anoikis, a type of apoptosis triggered by cell detachment: required for phosphorylation of p53/TP53 in response to loss of adhesion and is able to suppress metastasis. Part of a sodium-sensing signaling network, probably by mediating phosphorylation of PPME1: following increases in intracellular sodium, SIK1 is activated by CaMK1 and phosphorylates PPME1 subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to dephosphorylation of sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase ATP1A1 and subsequent increase activity of ATP1A1. Acts as a regulator of muscle cells by phosphorylating and inhibiting class II histone deacetylases HDAC4 and HDAC5, leading to promote expression of MEF2 target genes in myocytes. Also required during cardiomyogenesis by regulating the exit of cardiomyoblasts from the cell cycle via down-regulation of CDKN1C/p57Kip2. Acts as a regulator of hepatic gluconeogenesis by phosphorylating and repressing the CREB-specific coactivators CRTC1/TORC1 and CRTC2/TORC2, leading to inhibit CREB activity. Also regulates hepatic lipogenesis by phosphorylating and inhibiting SREBF1. In concert with CRTC1/TORC1, regulates the light-induced entrainment of the circadian clock by attenuating PER1 induction; represses CREB-mediated transcription of PER1 by phosphorylating and deactivating CRTC1/TORC1 (By similarity).
