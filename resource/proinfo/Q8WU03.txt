EntryName	GLYL2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glycine N-acyltransferase-like protein 2 (EC 2.3.1.13) (Acyl-CoA:glycine N-acyltransferase-like protein 2)
GeneName	GLYATL2
Length	294
Function	Mitochondrial acyltransferase which transfers the acyl group to the N-terminus of glycine (PubMed:20305126, PubMed:22475485). Conjugates numerous substrates, such as arachidonoyl-CoA and saturated medium and long-chain acyl-CoAs ranging from chain-length C8:0-CoA to C18:0-CoA, to form a variety of N-acylglycines. Shows a preference for monounsaturated fatty acid oleoyl-CoA (C18:1-CoA) as an acyl donor. Does not exhibit any activity toward C22:6-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA, nor toward serine or alanine (PubMed:20305126).
