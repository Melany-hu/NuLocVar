UniprotID	P30536
Accession	P30536;Q53Y59;Q6ICF9;Q96TF6
EntryName	TSPO_HUMAN
ProteinName	Translocator protein (Mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor) (PKBS) (Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor) (PBR)
GeneName	TSPO BZRP MBR
Length	169
Function	Can bind protoporphyrin IX and may play a role in the transport of porphyrins and heme (By similarity). Promotes the transport of cholesterol across mitochondrial membranes and may play a role in lipid metabolism (PubMed:24814875), but its precise physiological role is controversial. It is apparently not required for steroid hormone biosynthesis. Was initially identified as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor; can also bind isoquinoline carboxamides (PubMed:1847678).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion membrane
