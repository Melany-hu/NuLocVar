EntryName	CP17A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (EC 1.14.14.19) (17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone aldolase) (EC 1.14.14.32) (CYPXVII) (Cytochrome P450 17A1) (Cytochrome P450-C17) (Cytochrome P450c17) (Steroid 17-alpha-monooxygenase)
GeneName	CYP17A1 CYP17 S17AH
Length	508
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in corticoid and androgen biosynthesis (PubMed:22266943, PubMed:25301938, PubMed:27339894, PubMed:9452426). Catalyzes 17-alpha hydroxylation of C21 steroids, which is common for both pathways. A second oxidative step, required only for androgen synthesis, involves an acyl-carbon cleavage. The 17-alpha hydroxy intermediates, as part of adrenal glucocorticoids biosynthesis pathway, are precursors of cortisol (Probable) (PubMed:25301938, PubMed:9452426). Hydroxylates steroid hormones, pregnenolone and progesterone to form 17-alpha hydroxy metabolites, followed by the cleavage of the C17-C20 bond to form C19 steroids, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione (PubMed:22266943, PubMed:25301938, PubMed:27339894, PubMed:36640554, PubMed:9452426). Has 16-alpha hydroxylase activity. Catalyzes 16-alpha hydroxylation of 17-alpha hydroxy pregnenolone, followed by the cleavage of the C17-C20 bond to form 16-alpha-hydroxy DHEA (PubMed:36640554). Also 16-alpha hydroxylates androgens, relevant for estriol synthesis (PubMed:25301938, PubMed:27339894). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR; NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:22266943, PubMed:25301938, PubMed:27339894, PubMed:9452426).
