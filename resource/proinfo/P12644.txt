Length	408
Function	Growth factor of the TGF-beta superfamily that plays essential roles in many developmental processes, including neurogenesis, vascular development, angiogenesis and osteogenesis (PubMed:31363885). Acts in concert with PTHLH/PTHRP to stimulate ductal outgrowth during embryonic mammary development and to inhibit hair follicle induction (By similarity). Initiates the canonical BMP signaling cascade by associating with type I receptor BMPR1A and type II receptor BMPR2 (PubMed:25868050, PubMed:8006002). Once all three components are bound together in a complex at the cell surface, BMPR2 phosphorylates and activates BMPR1A. In turn, BMPR1A propagates signal by phosphorylating SMAD1/5/8 that travel to the nucleus and act as activators and repressors of transcription of target genes (PubMed:25868050, PubMed:29212066). Positively regulates the expression of odontogenic development regulator MSX1 via inducing the IPO7-mediated import of SMAD1 to the nucleus (By similarity). Required for MSX1-mediated mesenchymal molar tooth bud development beyond the bud stage, via promoting Wnt signaling (By similarity). Acts as a positive regulator of odontoblast differentiation during mesenchymal tooth germ formation, expression is repressed during the bell stage by MSX1-mediated inhibition of CTNNB1 signaling (By similarity). Able to induce its own expression in dental mesenchymal cells and also in the neighboring dental epithelial cells via an MSX1-mediated pathway (By similarity). Can also signal through non-canonical BMP pathways such as ERK/MAP kinase, PI3K/Akt, or SRC cascades (PubMed:31363885). For example, induces SRC phosphorylation which, in turn, activates VEGFR2, leading to an angiogenic response (PubMed:31363885).
