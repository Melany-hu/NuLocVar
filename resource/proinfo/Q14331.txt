UniprotID	Q14331
Accession	Q14331;A8K775
EntryName	FRG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein FRG1 (FSHD region gene 1 protein)
GeneName	FRG1
Length	258
Function	Binds to mRNA in a sequence-independent manner. May play a role in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing or in the assembly of rRNA into ribosomal subunits. May be involved in mRNA transport. May be involved in epigenetic regulation of muscle differentiation through regulation of activity of the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase KMT5B.
