UniprotID	P21673
Accession	P21673;Q6ICU9
EntryName	SAT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Diamine acetyltransferase 1 (EC 2.3.1.57) (Polyamine N-acetyltransferase 1) (Putrescine acetyltransferase) (Spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase 1) (SSAT) (SSAT-1)
GeneName	SAT1 SAT
Length	171
Function	Enzyme which catalyzes the acetylation of polyamines (PubMed:15283699, PubMed:16455797, PubMed:17516632). Substrate specificity: norspermidine = spermidine >> spermine > N(1)-acetylspermine (PubMed:17516632). This highly regulated enzyme allows a fine attenuation of the intracellular concentration of polyamines (PubMed:16455797). Also involved in the regulation of polyamine transport out of cells (PubMed:16455797). Also acts on 1,3-diaminopropane and 1,5-diaminopentane (PubMed:16455797, PubMed:17516632).
