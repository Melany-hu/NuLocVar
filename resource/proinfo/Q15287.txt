UniprotID	Q15287
Accession	Q15287;A8K1P0;B4DDU8;B4DZU7;B7ZA17;O75308;Q32P25;Q8WY42;Q9NYG3
EntryName	RNPS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA-binding protein with serine-rich domain 1 (SR-related protein LDC2)
GeneName	RNPS1 LDC2
Length	305
Function	Part of pre- and post-splicing multiprotein mRNP complexes. Auxiliary component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junction on mRNAs. The EJC is a dynamic structure consisting of core proteins and several peripheral nuclear and cytoplasmic associated factors that join the complex only transiently either during EJC assembly or during subsequent mRNA metabolism. Component of the ASAP and PSAP complexes which bind RNA in a sequence-independent manner and are proposed to be recruited to the EJC prior to or during the splicing process and to regulate specific excision of introns in specific transcription subsets. The ASAP complex can inhibit RNA processing during in vitro splicing reactions. The ASAP complex promotes apoptosis and is disassembled after induction of apoptosis. Enhances the formation of the ATP-dependent A complex of the spliceosome. Involved in both constitutive splicing and, in association with SRP54 and TRA2B/SFRS10, in distinctive modulation of alternative splicing in a substrate-dependent manner. Involved in the splicing modulation of BCL2L1/Bcl-X (and probably other apoptotic genes); specifically inhibits formation of proapoptotic isoforms such as Bcl-X(S); the activity is different from the established EJC assembly and function. Participates in mRNA 3'-end cleavage. Involved in UPF2-dependent nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mRNAs containing premature stop codons. Also mediates increase of mRNA abundance and translational efficiency. Binds spliced mRNA 20-25 nt upstream of exon-exon junctions.
