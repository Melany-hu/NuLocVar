UniprotID	Q9UK08
Accession	Q9UK08;Q4VBM5
EntryName	GBG8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(O) subunit gamma-8 (Gamma-9)
GeneName	GNG8 GNG9 GNGT9
Length	70
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as a modulator or transducer in various transmembrane signaling systems. The beta and gamma chains are required for the GTPase activity, for replacement of GDP by GTP, and for G protein-effector interaction.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
