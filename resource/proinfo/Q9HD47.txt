EntryName	MOG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ran guanine nucleotide release factor (RanGNRF) (Ran-binding protein MOG1)
GeneName	RANGRF MOG1 RANGNRF HSPC165 HSPC236 MDS5
Length	186
Function	May regulate the intracellular trafficking of RAN (PubMed:11290418). Promotes guanine nucleotide release from RAN and inhibits binding of new GTP by preventing the binding of the RAN guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 (PubMed:29040603). Regulates the levels of GTP-bound RAN in the nucleus, and thereby plays a role in the regulation of RAN-dependent mitotic spindle dynamics (PubMed:29040603). Enhances the expression of SCN5A at the cell membrane in cardiomyocytes (PubMed:18184654, PubMed:21621375, PubMed:23420830).
