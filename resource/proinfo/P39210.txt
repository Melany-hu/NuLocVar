UniprotID	P39210
Accession	P39210;D6W555;Q53SY2;Q96B08
EntryName	MPV17_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial inner membrane protein Mpv17 (Protein Mpv17)
GeneName	MPV17
Length	176
Function	Non-selective channel that modulates the membrane potential under normal conditions and oxidative stress, and is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis (PubMed:25861990). Involved in mitochondrial deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTP) pool homeostasis and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance (PubMed:26760297). May be involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolism and the control of oxidative phosphorylation (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
