UniprotID	Q15672
Accession	Q15672;A4D128;Q92487;Q99804
EntryName	TWST1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Twist-related protein 1 (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 38) (bHLHa38) (H-twist)
GeneName	TWIST1 BHLHA38 TWIST
Length	202
Function	Acts as a transcriptional regulator. Inhibits myogenesis by sequestrating E proteins, inhibiting trans-activation by MEF2, and inhibiting DNA-binding by MYOD1 through physical interaction. This interaction probably involves the basic domains of both proteins. Also represses expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFA and IL1B. Regulates cranial suture patterning and fusion. Activates transcription as a heterodimer with E proteins. Regulates gene expression differentially, depending on dimer composition. Homodimers induce expression of FGFR2 and POSTN while heterodimers repress FGFR2 and POSTN expression and induce THBS1 expression. Heterodimerization is also required for osteoblast differentiation. Represses the activity of the circadian transcriptional activator: NPAS2-BMAL1 heterodimer (By similarity).
