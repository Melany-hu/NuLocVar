UniprotID	O15121
Accession	O15121
EntryName	DEGS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sphingolipid delta(4)-desaturase DES1 (EC 1.14.19.17) (Cell migration-inducing gene 15 protein) (Degenerative spermatocyte homolog 1) (Dihydroceramide desaturase-1) (Membrane lipid desaturase) (Retinol isomerase) (EC 5.2.1.-)
GeneName	DEGS1 DES1 MLD MIG15
Length	323
Function	Has sphingolipid-delta-4-desaturase activity. Converts D-erythro-sphinganine to D-erythro-sphingosine (E-sphing-4-enine) (PubMed:11937514, PubMed:30620337, PubMed:30620338). Catalyzes the equilibrium isomerization of retinols (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
