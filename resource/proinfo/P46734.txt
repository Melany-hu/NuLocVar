UniprotID	P46734
Accession	P46734;B3KSK7;Q99441;Q9UE71;Q9UE72
EntryName	MP2K3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MAP kinase kinase 3) (MAPKK 3) (EC 2.7.12.2) (MAPK/ERK kinase 3) (MEK 3) (Stress-activated protein kinase kinase 2) (SAPK kinase 2) (SAPKK-2) (SAPKK2)
GeneName	MAP2K3 MEK3 MKK3 PRKMK3 SKK2
Length	347
Function	Dual specificity kinase. Is activated by cytokines and environmental stress in vivo. Catalyzes the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in the MAP kinase p38. Part of a signaling cascade that begins with the activation of the adrenergic receptor ADRA1B and leads to the activation of MAPK14.
