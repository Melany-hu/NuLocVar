UniprotID	Q9H3H1
Accession	Q9H3H1;A1A4X7;Q3T7B5;Q5QPK5;Q5QPK6;Q6IAC9;Q96FJ3;Q96L45;Q9NXT7
EntryName	MOD5_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA dimethylallyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.75) (Isopentenyl-diphosphate:tRNA isopentenyltransferase) (IPP transferase) (IPPT) (hGRO1) (tRNA isopentenyltransferase 1) (IPTase)
GeneName	TRIT1 IPT MOD5
Length	467
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of a dimethylallyl group onto the adenine at position 37 of both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs, leading to the formation of N6-(dimethylallyl)adenosine (i6A37) (PubMed:11111046, PubMed:24126054, PubMed:24901367, PubMed:34774131). Mediates modification of a limited subset of tRNAs: tRNA(Ser)(AGA), tRNA(Ser)(CGA), tRNA(Ser)(UGA), as well as partial modification of the selenocysteine tRNA(Ser)(UCA) (PubMed:24126054). TRIT1 is therefore required for selenoprotein expression (PubMed:24126054).
