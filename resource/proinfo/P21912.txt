UniprotID	P21912
Accession	P21912;B2R545;Q0QEY7;Q9NQ12
EntryName	SDHB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Succinate dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur subunit, mitochondrial (EC 1.3.5.1) (Iron-sulfur subunit of complex II) (Ip) (Malate dehydrogenase [quinone] iron-sulfur subunit) (EC 1.1.5.-)
GeneName	SDHB SDH SDH1
Length	280
Function	Iron-sulfur protein (IP) subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase complex (mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II), responsible for transferring electrons from succinate to ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) (PubMed:26925370, PubMed:27604842). SDH also oxidizes malate to the non-canonical enol form of oxaloacetate, enol-oxaloacetate (By similarity). Enol-oxaloacetate, which is a potent inhibitor of the succinate dehydrogenase activity, is further isomerized into keto-oxaloacetate (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
