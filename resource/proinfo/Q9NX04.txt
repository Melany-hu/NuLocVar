EntryName	AIRIM_HUMAN
ProteinName	AFG2-interacting ribosome maturation factor (Ribosome biogenesis protein C1orf109)
GeneName	AIRIM C1orf109
Length	203
Function	Part of the 55LCC heterohexameric ATPase complex which is chromatin-associated and promotes replisome proteostasis to maintain replication fork progression and genome stability. Required for replication fork progression, sister chromatid cohesion, and chromosome stability. The ATPase activity is specifically enhanced by replication fork DNA and is coupled to cysteine protease-dependent cleavage of replisome substrates in response to replication fork damage. Uses ATPase activity to process replisome substrates in S-phase, facilitating their proteolytic turnover from chromatin to ensure DNA replication and mitotic fidelity (PubMed:38554706). Involved in the cytoplasmic maturation steps of pre-60S ribosomal particles by promoting the release of shuttling protein RSL24D1/RLP24 from the pre-ribosomal particles (PubMed:35354024).
