EntryName	GHC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial glutamate carrier 1 (GC-1) (Glutamate/H(+) symporter 1) (Solute carrier family 25 member 22)
GeneName	SLC25A22 GC1
Length	323
Function	Mitochondrial glutamate/H(+) symporter. Responsible for the transport of glutamate from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix with the concomitant import of a proton (PubMed:11897791). Plays a role in the control of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
