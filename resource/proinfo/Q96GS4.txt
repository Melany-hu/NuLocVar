UniprotID	Q96GS4
Accession	Q96GS4;Q53HS4;Q9NXW8
EntryName	BORC6_HUMAN
ProteinName	BLOC-1-related complex subunit 6 (Lysosome-dispersing protein) (Lyspersin)
GeneName	BORCS6 C17orf59
Length	357
Function	As part of the BORC complex may play a role in lysosomes movement and localization at the cell periphery. Associated with the cytosolic face of lysosomes, the BORC complex may recruit ARL8B and couple lysosomes to microtubule plus-end-directed kinesin motor.
Subcellular Location	Lysosome membrane
