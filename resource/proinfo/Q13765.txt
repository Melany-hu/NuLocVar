UniprotID	Q13765
Accession	Q13765;A8MTN7;B2R4P8;F8VU71;Q3KQV4;Q53A18;Q53G46
EntryName	NACA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nascent polypeptide-associated complex subunit alpha (NAC-alpha) (Alpha-NAC) (allergen Hom s 2)
GeneName	NACA HSD48
Length	215
Function	Prevents inappropriate targeting of non-secretory polypeptides to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Binds to nascent polypeptide chains as they emerge from the ribosome and blocks their interaction with the signal recognition particle (SRP), which normally targets nascent secretory peptides to the ER. Also reduces the inherent affinity of ribosomes for protein translocation sites in the ER membrane (M sites). May act as a specific coactivator for JUN, binding to DNA and stabilizing the interaction of JUN homodimers with target gene promoters.
