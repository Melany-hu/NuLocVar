UniprotID	Q96G25
Accession	Q96G25;A9IZ91;A9IZ92;Q5JUY8;Q96FQ4
EntryName	MED8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 8 (Activator-recruited cofactor 32 kDa component) (ARC32) (Mediator complex subunit 8)
GeneName	MED8
Length	268
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors. May play a role as a target recruitment subunit in E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes and thus in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins.
