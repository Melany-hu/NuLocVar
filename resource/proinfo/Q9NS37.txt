EntryName	ZHANG_HUMAN
ProteinName	CREB/ATF bZIP transcription factor (Host cell factor-binding transcription factor Zhangfei) (HCF-binding transcription factor Zhangfei)
GeneName	CREBZF ZF
Length	354
Function	Strongly activates transcription when bound to HCFC1. Suppresses the expression of HSV proteins in cells infected with the virus in a HCFC1-dependent manner. Also suppresses the HCFC1-dependent transcriptional activation by CREB3 and reduces the amount of CREB3 in the cell. Able to down-regulate expression of some cellular genes in CREBZF-expressing cells.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
