ProteinName	Dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, mitochondrial (EC 2.3.1.61) (2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex component E2) (OGDC-E2) (Dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex) (E2K)
GeneName	DLST DLTS
Length	453
Function	Dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (E2) component of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes the overall conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA and CO(2). The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is mainly active in the mitochondrion (PubMed:29211711, PubMed:30929736). A fraction of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex also localizes in the nucleus and is required for lysine succinylation of histones: associates with KAT2A on chromatin and provides succinyl-CoA to histone succinyltransferase KAT2A (PubMed:29211711).
