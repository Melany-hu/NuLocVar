UniprotID	Q8TDP1
Accession	Q8TDP1;Q9H7F5
EntryName	RNH2C_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease H2 subunit C (RNase H2 subunit C) (Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 3 protein) (AGS3) (RNase H1 small subunit) (Ribonuclease HI subunit C)
GeneName	RNASEH2C AYP1
Length	164
Function	Non catalytic subunit of RNase H2, an endonuclease that specifically degrades the RNA of RNA:DNA hybrids. Participates in DNA replication, possibly by mediating the removal of lagging-strand Okazaki fragment RNA primers during DNA replication. Mediates the excision of single ribonucleotides from DNA:RNA duplexes.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
