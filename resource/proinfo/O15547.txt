EntryName	P2RX6_HUMAN
ProteinName	P2X purinoceptor 6 (P2X6) (ATP receptor) (P2XM) (Purinergic receptor) (Purinergic receptor P2X-like 1)
GeneName	P2RX6 P2RXL1 P2X6
Length	441
Function	May act as a modulatory subunit rather than a functional channel. Unlike other P2XRs members, P2RX6 does not seem to form functional homotrimers (PubMed:22378790). P2RX6 requires the presence of P2RX4 or P2RX2 to shuttle it to the plasma membrane where it may form functional heterotrimeric receptors at the plasma membrane (PubMed:22378790). P2RX6 can be translocated to the nucleus and functions as a nuclear regulator of post-transcriptional modifications in neurons (By similarity).
