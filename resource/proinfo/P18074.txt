ProteinName	General transcription and DNA repair factor IIH helicase subunit XPD (TFIIH subunit XPD) (EC 5.6.2.3) (Basic transcription factor 2 80 kDa subunit) (BTF2 p80) (CXPD) (DNA 5'-3' helicase XPD) (DNA excision repair protein ERCC-2) (DNA repair protein complementing XP-D cells) (TFIIH basal transcription factor complex 80 kDa subunit) (TFIIH 80 kDa subunit) (TFIIH p80) (Xeroderma pigmentosum group D-complementing protein)
GeneName	ERCC2 XPD XPDC
Length	760
Function	ATP-dependent 5'-3' DNA helicase (PubMed:31253769, PubMed:8413672, PubMed:9771713). Component of the general transcription and DNA repair factor IIH (TFIIH) core complex, not absolutely essential for minimal transcription in vitro (PubMed:10024882, PubMed:17466626, PubMed:9771713). Required for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (NER) of damaged DNA; recognizes damaged bases (PubMed:17466626, PubMed:23352696, PubMed:9771713). Sequestered in chromatin on UV-damaged DNA (PubMed:23352696). When complexed to CDK-activating kinase (CAK), involved in transcription by RNA polymerase II. In NER, TFIIH acts by opening DNA around the lesion to allow the excision of the damaged oligonucleotide and its replacement by a new DNA fragment. The ATP-dependent helicase activity of XPD/ERCC2 is required for DNA opening. Involved in DNA lesion verification (PubMed:31253769). In transcription, TFIIH has an essential role in transcription initiation. When the pre-initiation complex (PIC) has been established, TFIIH is required for promoter opening and promoter escape. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II by the kinase module CAK controls the initiation of transcription. XPD/ERCC2 acts by forming a bridge between CAK and the core-TFIIH complex. The structure of the TFIIH transcription complex differs from the NER-TFIIH complex; large movements by XPD/ERCC2 and XPB/ERCC3 are stabilized by XPA which allow this subunit to contact ssDNA (PubMed:31253769, PubMed:33902107). Involved in the regulation of vitamin-D receptor activity. As part of the mitotic spindle-associated MMXD complex it plays a role in chromosome segregation. Might have a role in aging process and could play a causative role in the generation of skin cancers.
