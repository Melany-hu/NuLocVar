UniprotID	Q99732
Accession	Q99732;D3DUG1;G5E9K0;Q05DW0;Q9C0L6
EntryName	LITAF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LPS-induced TNF-alpha factor) (Small integral membrane protein of lysosome/late endosome) (p53-induced gene 7 protein)
GeneName	LITAF PIG7 SIMPLE
Length	161
Function	Plays a role in endosomal protein trafficking and in targeting proteins for lysosomal degradation (PubMed:23166352). Plays a role in targeting endocytosed EGFR and ERGG3 for lysosomal degradation, and thereby helps down-regulate downstream signaling cascades (PubMed:23166352). Helps recruit the ESCRT complex components TSG101, HGS and STAM to cytoplasmic membranes (PubMed:23166352). Probably plays a role in regulating protein degradation via its interaction with NEDD4 (PubMed:15776429). May also contribute to the regulation of gene expression in the nucleus (PubMed:10200294, PubMed:15793005). Binds DNA (in vitro) and may play a synergistic role with STAT6 in the nucleus in regulating the expression of various cytokines (PubMed:15793005). May regulate the expression of numerous cytokines, such as TNF, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, IL1A and IL10 (PubMed:10200294, PubMed:15793005).
