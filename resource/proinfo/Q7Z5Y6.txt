UniprotID	Q7Z5Y6
Accession	Q7Z5Y6;Q5T3A5
EntryName	BMP8A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bone morphogenetic protein 8A (BMP-8A)
GeneName	BMP8A
Length	402
Function	Induces cartilage and bone formation. May be the osteoinductive factor responsible for the phenomenon of epithelial osteogenesis. Plays a role in calcium regulation and bone homeostasis (By similarity). Signaling protein involved in regulation of thermogenesis and energy balance. Proposed to increase the peripheral response of brown adipose tissue (BAT) to adrenergic stimulation while acting centrally in the hypothalamus to increase sympathetic output to BAT.
