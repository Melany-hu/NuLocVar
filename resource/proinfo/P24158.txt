UniprotID	P24158
Accession	P24158;P15637;P18078;Q4VB08;Q4VB09;Q6LBM7;Q6LBN2;Q9UD25;Q9UQD8
EntryName	PRTN3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Myeloblastin (EC 3.4.21.76) (AGP7) (C-ANCA antigen) (Leukocyte proteinase 3) (PR-3) (PR3) (Neutrophil proteinase 4) (NP-4) (P29) (Wegener autoantigen)
GeneName	PRTN3 MBN
Length	256
Function	Serine protease that degrades elastin, fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and collagen types I, III, and IV (in vitro) (PubMed:2033050, PubMed:28240246, PubMed:3198760). By cleaving and activating receptor F2RL1/PAR-2, enhances endothelial cell barrier function and thus vascular integrity during neutrophil transendothelial migration (PubMed:23202369). Plays a role in neutrophil transendothelial migration, probably when associated with CD177 (PubMed:22266279). Triggers inflammatory processes in neutrophils by interacting with ADGRG3 upstream of F2RL1/PAR2 activation (PubMed:36302784).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasmic granule; Secreted; Cell membrane; Membrane raft
