EntryName	HMR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Major histocompatibility complex class I-related gene protein (MHC class I-related gene protein) (Class I histocompatibility antigen-like protein)
GeneName	MR1
Length	341
Function	Antigen-presenting molecule specialized in displaying microbial pyrimidine-based metabolites to alpha-beta T cell receptors (TCR) on innate-type mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells (PubMed:12794138, PubMed:19416870, PubMed:22692454, PubMed:23051753, PubMed:23846752, PubMed:26795251). In complex with B2M preferentially presents riboflavin-derived metabolites to semi-invariant TRAV1-2 TCRs on MAIT cells, guiding immune surveillance of the microbial metabolome at mucosal epithelial barriers (PubMed:20581831, PubMed:24695216, PubMed:26795251). Signature pyrimidine-based microbial antigens are generated via non-enzymatic condensation of metabolite intermediates of the riboflavin pathway with by-products arising from other metabolic pathways such as glycolysis. Typical potent antigenic metabolites are 5-(2-oxoethylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-OE-RU) and 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-OP-RU), products of condensation of 5-amino-6-D-ribityaminouracil (5-A-RU) with glyoxal or methylglyoxal by-products, respectively (PubMed:24695216). May present microbial antigens to various TRAV1-2-negative MAIT cell subsets, providing for unique recognition of diverse microbes, including pathogens that do not synthesize riboflavin (PubMed:27527800, PubMed:31113973). Upon antigen recognition, elicits rapid innate-type MAIT cell activation to eliminate pathogenic microbes by directly killing infected cells (PubMed:23846752, PubMed:24695216, PubMed:27527800). During T cell development, drives thymic selection and post-thymic terminal differentiation of MAIT cells in a process dependent on commensal microflora (By similarity). Acts as an immune sensor of cancer cell metabolome (PubMed:31959982). May present a tumor-specific or -associated metabolite essential for cancer cell survival to a pan-cancer TCR consisting of TRAV38.2-DV8*TRAJ31 alpha chain paired with a TRBV25.1*TRBJ2.3 beta chain on a non-MAIT CD8-positive T cell clone (MC.7.G5), triggering T cell-mediated killing of a wide range of cancer cell types (PubMed:31959982).
