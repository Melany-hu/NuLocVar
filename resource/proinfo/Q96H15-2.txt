ProteinName	T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 4 (TIMD-4) (T-cell immunoglobulin mucin receptor 4) (TIM-4) (T-cell membrane protein 4)

Length	350
Function	Phosphatidylserine receptor that plays different role in immune response including phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and T-cell regulation. Controls T-cell activation in a bimodal fashion, decreasing the activation of naive T-cells by inducing cell cycle arrest, while increasing proliferation of activated T-cells by activating AKT1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations and subsequent signaling pathways (By similarity). Also plays a role in efferocytosis which is the process by which apoptotic cells are removed by phagocytic cells (PubMed:32703939, PubMed:34067457). Mechanistically, promotes the engulfment of apoptotic cells or exogenous particles by securing them to phagocytes through direct binding to phosphatidylserine present on apoptotic cells, while other engulfment receptors such as MERTK efficiently recognize apoptotic cells and mediate their ingestion (PubMed:32640697). Additionally, promotes autophagy process by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activity via activation of LKB1/PRKAA1 pathway in a phosphatidylserine-dependent mechanism (By similarity).
