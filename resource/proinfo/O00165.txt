UniprotID	O00165
Accession	O00165;A8W4W9;A8W4X0;B4DUJ7;Q5VYD5;Q5VYD7;Q96AU4;Q9BS80
EntryName	HAX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HS1-associating protein X-1) (HAX-1) (HS1-binding protein 1) (HSP1BP-1)
GeneName	HAX1 HS1BP1
Length	279
Function	Recruits the Arp2/3 complex to the cell cortex and regulates reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton via its interaction with KCNC3 and the Arp2/3 complex (PubMed:26997484). Slows down the rate of inactivation of KCNC3 channels (PubMed:26997484). Promotes GNA13-mediated cell migration. Involved in the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway. May be involved in internalization of ABC transporters such as ABCB11. May inhibit CASP9 and CASP3. Promotes cell survival. May regulate intracellular calcium pools.
