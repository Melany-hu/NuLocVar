UniprotID	P31941
Accession	P31941;A0AVM1;Q12807;Q5JZ93;Q9UH18
EntryName	ABC3A_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA dC->dU-editing enzyme APOBEC-3A (A3A) (EC 3.5.4.38) (Phorbolin-1)
GeneName	APOBEC3A
Length	199
Function	DNA deaminase (cytidine deaminase) with restriction activity against viruses, foreign DNA and mobility of retrotransposons. Exhibits antiviral activity against adeno-associated virus (AAV) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and may inhibit the mobility of LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons. Selectively targets single-stranded DNA and can deaminate both methylcytosine and cytosine in foreign DNA. Can induce somatic hypermutation in the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. May also play a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through the process of active DNA demethylation.
