UniprotID	Q9UGN4
Accession	Q9UGN4;A8MW96;O95100;Q9HD97;Q9P0F3;Q9UBK4;Q9UMS9;Q9UMT0
EntryName	CLM8_HUMAN
ProteinName	CMRF35-like molecule 8 (CLM-8) (CD300 antigen-like family member A) (CMRF-35-H9) (CMRF35-H9) (CMRF35-H) (IRC1/IRC2) (Immunoglobulin superfamily member 12) (IgSF12) (Inhibitory receptor protein 60) (IRp60) (NK inhibitory receptor) (CD antigen CD300a)
GeneName	CD300A CMRF35H IGSF12 HSPC083
Length	299
Function	Inhibitory receptor which may contribute to the down-regulation of cytolytic activity in natural killer (NK) cells, and to the down-regulation of mast cell degranulation (PubMed:10746781, PubMed:16339535, PubMed:9701027). Negatively regulates the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling mediated by MYD88 but not TRIF through activation of PTPN6 (PubMed:22043923).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
