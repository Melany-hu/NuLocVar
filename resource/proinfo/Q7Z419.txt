EntryName	R144B_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF144B (EC 2.3.2.31) (IBR domain-containing protein 2) (RING finger protein 144B) (p53-inducible RING finger protein)
GeneName	RNF144B IBRDC2 P53RFP
Length	303
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which accepts ubiquitin from E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2L3 and UBE2L6 in the form of a thioester and then directly transfers the ubiquitin to targeted substrates such as LCMT2, thereby promoting their degradation. Induces apoptosis via a p53/TP53-dependent but caspase-independent mechanism. Plays a crucial role in maintaining the genomic stability by controlling the degradation of multiple proteins involved in mitotic progression and DNA damage (PubMed:38685100). Regulates epithelial homeostasis by mediating degradation of CDKN1A and isoform 2 of TP63 (PubMed:23128396). Plays a regulatory role in innate immunity by negatively regulating IRF3 activation and IFN-beta production. Mechanistically, inhibits TBK1 phosphorylation and 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination independently of its E3 ligase activity (PubMed:31509299). Alternatively, promotes 'Lys-27' and 'Lys-33'-linked ubiquitination of IFIH1/MDA5, promoting selective autophagic degradation of IFIH1/MDA5 to inhibit antiviral response (PubMed:39285245).
