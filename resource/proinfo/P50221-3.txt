Accession	P50221;A8K524;A8MWF9;Q15069
EntryName	MEOX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein MOX-1 (Mesenchyme homeobox 1)
GeneName	MEOX1 MOX1
Length	139
Function	Mesodermal transcription factor that plays a key role in somitogenesis and is specifically required for sclerotome development. Required for maintenance of the sclerotome polarity and formation of the cranio-cervical joints (PubMed:23290072, PubMed:24073994). Binds specifically to the promoter of target genes and regulates their expression. Activates expression of NKX3-2 in the sclerotome. Activates expression of CDKN1A and CDKN2A in endothelial cells, acting as a regulator of vascular cell proliferation. While it activates CDKN1A in a DNA-dependent manner, it activates CDKN2A in a DNA-independent manner. Required for hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) induction via its role in somitogenesis: specification of HSCs occurs via the deployment of a specific endothelial precursor population, which arises within a sub-compartment of the somite named endotome.
