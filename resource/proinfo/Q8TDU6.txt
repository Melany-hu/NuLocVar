UniprotID	Q8TDU6
Accession	Q8TDU6;B3KV35
EntryName	GPBAR_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled bile acid receptor 1 (G-protein coupled receptor GPCR19) (hGPCR19) (Membrane-type receptor for bile acids) (M-BAR) (hBG37) (BG37)
GeneName	GPBAR1 TGR5
Length	330
Function	Receptor for bile acid. Bile acid-binding induces its internalization, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and intracellular cAMP production. May be involved in the suppression of macrophage functions by bile acids.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
