EntryName	TRIM7_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRIM7 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Glycogenin-interacting protein) (RING finger protein 90) (Tripartite motif-containing protein 7)
GeneName	TRIM7 GNIP RNF90
Length	511
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that have both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing activities and functions in several biological processes including innate immunity, regulation of ferroptosis as well as cell proliferation and migration (PubMed:25851810, PubMed:32853985, PubMed:34062120). Acts as an antiviral effector against multiple viruses by targeting specific viral proteins for ubiquitination and degradation including norovirus NTPase protein or SARS-CoV-2 NSP5 and NSP8 proteins (PubMed:34062120, PubMed:35982226). Mechanistically, recognizes the C-terminal glutamine-containing motif usually generated by viral proteases that process the polyproteins and trigger their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (PubMed:35867826, PubMed:35893676, PubMed:35982226). Mediates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination and stabilization of the JUN coactivator RNF187 in response to growth factor signaling via the MEK/ERK pathway, thereby regulating JUN transactivation and cellular proliferation (PubMed:25851810). Promotes the TLR4-mediated signaling activation through its E3 ligase domain leading to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferon (By similarity). Also plays a negative role in the regulation of exogenous cytosolic DNA virus-triggered immune response. Mechanistically, enhances the 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination of STING1 leading to its proteasome-dependent degradation (PubMed:32126128). Mediates the ubiquitination of the SIN3-HDAC chromatin remodeling complex component BRMS1 (PubMed:32853985). Modulates NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy and ferroptosis in glioblastoma cells by ubiquitinating NCOA4, leading to its degradation (PubMed:36067704).
