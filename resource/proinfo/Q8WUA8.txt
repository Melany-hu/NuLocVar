EntryName	TSK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tsukushi (E2-induced gene 4 protein) (Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 54)
GeneName	TSKU E2IG4 LRRC54 TSK UNQ850/PRO1788
Length	353
Function	Contributes to various developmental events and other processes such as wound healing and cholesterol homeostasis through its interactions with multiple signaling pathways. Wnt signaling inhibitor which competes with WNT2B for binding to Wnt receptor FZD4 and represses WNT2B-dependent development of the peripheral eye. Plays a role in regulating the hair cycle by controlling TGFB1 signaling. Required for the development of the anterior commissure in the brain by inhibiting neurite outgrowth. Essential for terminal differentiation of hippocampal neural stem cells. Plays a role in regulating bone elongation and bone mass by modulating growth plate chondrocyte function and overall body size. Required for development of the inner ear through its involvement in stereocilia formation in inner hair cells. Facilitates wound healing by inhibiting secretion of TGFB1 from macrophages which prevents myofibroblast differentiation, maintaining inflammatory cell quiescence. Plays a role in cholesterol homeostasis by reducing circulating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lowering cholesterol efflux capacity and decreasing cholesterol-to-bile acid conversion in the liver. In one study, shown to negatively regulate sympathetic innervation in brown fat, leading to reduced energy expenditure. In another study, shown not to affect brown fat thermogenic capacity, body weight gain or glucose homeostasis.
