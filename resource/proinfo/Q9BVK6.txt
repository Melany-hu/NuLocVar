UniprotID	Q9BVK6
Accession	Q9BVK6;Q14437;Q8WZ61
EntryName	TMED9_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 9 (GMP25) (Glycoprotein 25L2) (p24 family protein alpha-2) (p24alpha2) (p25)
GeneName	TMED9 GP25L2
Length	235
Function	Appears to be involved in vesicular protein trafficking, mainly in the early secretory pathway. In COPI vesicle-mediated retrograde transport involved in the coatomer recruitment to membranes of the early secretory pathway. Increases coatomer-dependent activity of ARFGAP2. Thought to play a crucial role in the specific retention of p24 complexes in cis-Golgi membranes; specifically contributes to the coupled localization of TMED2 and TMED10 in the cis-Golgi network. May be involved in organization of intracellular membranes, such as of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the Golgi apparatus. Involved in ER localization of PTPN2 isoform PTPB.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus; cis-Golgi network membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment membrane; Golgi apparatus; trans-Golgi network membrane
