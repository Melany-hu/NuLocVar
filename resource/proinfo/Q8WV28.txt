UniprotID	Q8WV28
Accession	Q8WV28;O75498;O75499;Q2MD49
EntryName	BLNK_HUMAN
ProteinName	B-cell linker protein (B-cell adapter containing a SH2 domain protein) (B-cell adapter containing a Src homology 2 domain protein) (Cytoplasmic adapter protein) (Src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 65 kDa) (SLP-65)
GeneName	BLNK BASH SLP65
Length	456
Function	Functions as a central linker protein, downstream of the B-cell receptor (BCR), bridging the SYK kinase to a multitude of signaling pathways and regulating biological outcomes of B-cell function and development. Plays a role in the activation of ERK/EPHB2, MAP kinase p38 and JNK. Modulates AP1 activation. Important for the activation of NF-kappa-B and NFAT. Plays an important role in BCR-mediated PLCG1 and PLCG2 activation and Ca(2+) mobilization and is required for trafficking of the BCR to late endosomes. However, does not seem to be required for pre-BCR-mediated activation of MAP kinase and phosphatidyl-inositol 3 (PI3) kinase signaling. May be required for the RAC1-JNK pathway. Plays a critical role in orchestrating the pro-B cell to pre-B cell transition. May play an important role in BCR-induced B-cell apoptosis.
