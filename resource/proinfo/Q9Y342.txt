UniprotID	Q9Y342
Accession	Q9Y342;B2R9T6
EntryName	PLLP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Plasmolipin (Plasma membrane proteolipid)
GeneName	PLLP PMLP TM4SF11
Length	182
Function	Main component of the myelin sheath that plays an important role in myelin membrane biogenesis and myelination (PubMed:26002055). Plays an essential function in apical endocytosis. Regulates epithelial development through the regulation of apical endocytosis (By similarity). Part of the intracellular machinery that mediates basolateral-to-apical transport of ICAM-1, an essential adhesion receptor in epithelial cells, from the subapical compartment in hepatic epithelial cells (PubMed:34999972).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Myelin membrane; Apical cell membrane; Golgi apparatus
