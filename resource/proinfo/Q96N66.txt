EntryName	MBOA7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysophospholipid acyltransferase 7 (LPLAT 7) (EC 2.3.1.-) (1-acylglycerophosphatidylinositol O-acyltransferase) (Bladder and breast carcinoma-overexpressed gene 1 protein) (Leukocyte receptor cluster member 4) (Lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase) (LPIAT) (Lyso-PI acyltransferase) (Membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing protein 7) (O-acyltransferase domain-containing protein 7) (h-mboa-7)
GeneName	MBOAT7 BB1 LENG4 OACT7
Length	472
Function	Acyltransferase which catalyzes the transfer of an acyl group from an acyl-CoA to a lysophosphatidylinositol (1-acylglycerophosphatidylinositol or LPI) leading to the production of a phosphatidylinositol (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol or PI) and participates in the reacylation step of the phospholipid remodeling pathway also known as the Lands cycle (PubMed:18094042, PubMed:18772128). Prefers arachidonoyl-CoA as the acyl donor, thus contributing to the regulation of free levels arachidonic acid in cell (PubMed:18094042, PubMed:18772128). In liver, participates in the regulation of triglyceride metabolism through the phosphatidylinositol acyl-chain remodeling regulation (PubMed:32253259).
