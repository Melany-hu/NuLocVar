UniprotID	P52566
Accession	P52566;B5BU79
EntryName	GDIR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2 (Rho GDI 2) (Ly-GDI) (Rho-GDI beta)
GeneName	ARHGDIB GDIA2 GDID4 RAP1GN1
Length	201
Function	Regulates the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of the Rho proteins by inhibiting the dissociation of GDP from them, and the subsequent binding of GTP to them (PubMed:7512369, PubMed:8356058). Regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton mediated by Rho family members (PubMed:8262133).
