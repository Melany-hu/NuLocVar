EntryName	E2F6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor E2F6 (E2F-6)
GeneName	E2F6
Length	281
Function	Inhibitor of E2F-dependent transcription (PubMed:9501179, PubMed:9689056, PubMed:9704927). Binds DNA cooperatively with DP proteins through the E2 recognition site, 5'-TTTCCGC-3' (PubMed:9501179). Has a preference for the 5'-TTTCCCGC-3' E2F recognition site (PubMed:9501179). E2F6 lacks the transcriptional activation and pocket protein binding domains (PubMed:9501179, PubMed:9704927). Appears to regulate a subset of E2F-dependent genes whose products are required for entry into the cell cycle but not for normal cell cycle progression (PubMed:9501179, PubMed:9689056). Represses expression of some meiosis-specific genes, including SLC25A31/ANT4 (By similarity). May silence expression via the recruitment of a chromatin remodeling complex containing histone H3-K9 methyltransferase activity. Overexpression delays the exit of cells from the S-phase (PubMed:9501179).
