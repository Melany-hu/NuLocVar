UniprotID	P35249
Accession	P35249;B4DM41;D3DNV2;Q6FHX7
EntryName	RFC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Replication factor C subunit 4 (Activator 1 37 kDa subunit) (A1 37 kDa subunit) (Activator 1 subunit 4) (Replication factor C 37 kDa subunit) (RF-C 37 kDa subunit) (RFC37)
GeneName	RFC4
Length	363
Function	Subunit of the replication factor C (RFC) complex which acts during elongation of primed DNA templates by DNA polymerases delta and epsilon, and is necessary for ATP-dependent loading of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto primed DNA. The RFC4 subunit probably functions as a scaffold on which the other complex components can assemble.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
