UniprotID	Q9NVC6
Accession	Q9NVC6;B3KN07;Q9HA81;Q9UNP7;Q9Y2W0;Q9Y660
EntryName	MED17_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 17 (Activator-recruited cofactor 77 kDa component) (ARC77) (Cofactor required for Sp1 transcriptional activation subunit 6) (CRSP complex subunit 6) (Mediator complex subunit 17) (Thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein complex 80 kDa component) (Trap80) (Transcriptional coactivator CRSP77) (Vitamin D3 receptor-interacting protein complex 80 kDa component) (DRIP80)
GeneName	MED17 ARC77 CRSP6 DRIP77 DRIP80 TRAP80
Length	651
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
