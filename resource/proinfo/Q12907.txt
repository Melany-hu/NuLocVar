UniprotID	Q12907
Accession	Q12907;Q53HH1
EntryName	LMAN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vesicular integral-membrane protein VIP36 (Glycoprotein GP36b) (Lectin mannose-binding 2) (Vesicular integral-membrane protein 36) (VIP36)
GeneName	LMAN2 C5orf8
Length	356
Function	Plays a role as an intracellular lectin in the early secretory pathway. Interacts with N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and high-mannose type glycans and may also bind to O-linked glycans. Involved in the transport and sorting of glycoproteins carrying high mannose-type glycans (By similarity).
