UniprotID	P21757
Accession	P21757;D3DSP3;O60505;P21759;Q45F10
EntryName	MSRE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Macrophage scavenger receptor types I and II (Macrophage acetylated LDL receptor I and II) (Scavenger receptor class A member 1) (CD antigen CD204)
GeneName	MSR1 SCARA1
Length	451
Function	Membrane glycoproteins implicated in the pathologic deposition of cholesterol in arterial walls during atherogenesis. Two types of receptor subunits exist. These receptors mediate the endocytosis of a diverse group of macromolecules, including modified low density lipoproteins (LDL) (PubMed:2251254). Isoform III does not internalize acetylated LDL (PubMed:9548586).
