EntryName	SNX5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sorting nexin-5
GeneName	SNX5
Length	126
Function	Involved in several stages of intracellular trafficking. Interacts with membranes containing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3P)) or phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) (PubMed:15561769). Acts in part as component of the retromer membrane-deforming SNX-BAR subcomplex. The SNX-BAR retromer mediates retrograde transport of cargo proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and is involved in endosome-to-plasma membrane transport for cargo protein recycling. The SNX-BAR subcomplex functions to deform the donor membrane into a tubular profile called endosome-to-TGN transport carrier (ETC) (Probable). Does not have in vitro vesicle-to-membrane remodeling activity (PubMed:23085988). Involved in retrograde transport of lysosomal enzyme receptor IGF2R (PubMed:17148574, PubMed:18596235). May function as link between endosomal transport vesicles and dynactin (Probable). Plays a role in the internalization of EGFR after EGF stimulation (Probable). Involved in EGFR endosomal sorting and degradation; the function involves PIP5K1C isoform 3 and is retromer-independent (PubMed:23602387). Together with PIP5K1C isoform 3 facilitates HGS interaction with ubiquitinated EGFR, which initiates EGFR sorting to intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of the multivesicular body for subsequent lysosomal degradation (Probable). Involved in E-cadherin sorting and degradation; inhibits PIP5K1C isoform 3-mediated E-cadherin degradation (PubMed:24610942). Plays a role in macropinocytosis (PubMed:18854019, PubMed:21048941).
