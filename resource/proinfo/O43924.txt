UniprotID	O43924
Accession	O43924;O43250
EntryName	PDE6D_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinal rod rhodopsin-sensitive cGMP 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase subunit delta (GMP-PDE delta) (Protein p17)
GeneName	PDE6D PDED
Length	150
Function	Promotes the release of prenylated target proteins from cellular membranes (PubMed:9712853). Modulates the activity of prenylated or palmitoylated Ras family members by regulating their subcellular location (PubMed:22002721, PubMed:23698361). Required for normal ciliary targeting of farnesylated target proteins, such as INPP5E (PubMed:24166846). Modulates the subcellular location of target proteins by acting as a GTP specific dissociation inhibitor (GDI) (By similarity). Increases the affinity of ARL3 for GTP by several orders of magnitude. Stabilizes ARL3-GTP by decreasing the nucleotide dissociation rate (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytosol; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium basal body
