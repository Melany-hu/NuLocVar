UniprotID	O43598-2
Accession	O43598;B2LUJ9
EntryName	DNPH1_HUMAN
ProteinName	5-hydroxymethyl-dUMP N-hydrolase (EC 3.2.2.-) (2'-deoxynucleoside 5'-phosphate N-hydrolase 1) (c-Myc-responsive protein RCL)
GeneName	DNPH1 C6orf108 RCL
Length	148
Function	Part of a nucleotide salvage pathway that eliminates epigenetically modified 5-hydroxymethyl-dCMP (hmdCMP) in a two-step process entailing deamination to cytotoxic 5-hydroxymethyl-dUMP (hmdUMP), followed by its hydrolysis into 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) and 2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate (deoxyribosephosphate) (PubMed:33833118). Catalyzes the second step in that pathway, the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond in hmdUMP, degrading this cytotoxic nucleotide to avoid its genomic integration (PubMed:33833118).
