UniprotID	Q9P0P0
Accession	Q9P0P0;Q53H81
EntryName	RN181_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF181 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 181)
GeneName	RNF181 HSPC238
Length	153
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase which accepts ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the form of a thioester and then directly transfers the ubiquitin to targeted substrates (PubMed:18331836). Catalyzes monoubiquitination of 26S proteasome subunit PSMC2/RPT1 (PubMed:24811749).
