EntryName	ELL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA polymerase II elongation factor ELL3
GeneName	ELL3
Length	397
Function	Enhancer-binding elongation factor that specifically binds enhancers in embryonic stem cells (ES cells), marks them, and is required for their future activation during stem cell specification. Does not only bind to enhancer regions of active genes, but also marks the enhancers that are in a poised or inactive state in ES cells and is required for establishing proper RNA polymerase II occupancy at developmentally regulated genes in a cohesin-dependent manner. Probably required for priming developmentally regulated genes for later recruitment of the super elongation complex (SEC), for transcriptional activation during differentiation. Required for recruitment of P-TEFb within SEC during differentiation. Probably preloaded on germ cell chromatin, suggesting that it may prime gene activation by marking enhancers as early as in the germ cells. Promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (By similarity). Elongation factor component of the super elongation complex (SEC), a complex required to increase the catalytic rate of RNA polymerase II transcription by suppressing transient pausing by the polymerase at multiple sites along the DNA. Component of the little elongation complex (LEC), a complex required to regulate small nuclear RNA (snRNA) gene transcription by RNA polymerase II and III (PubMed:22195968).
