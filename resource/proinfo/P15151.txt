UniprotID	P15151
Accession	P15151;B4DTS9;P15152;Q15267;Q15268;Q96BJ1
EntryName	PVR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Poliovirus receptor (Nectin-like protein 5) (NECL-5) (CD antigen CD155)
GeneName	PVR PVS
Length	417
Function	Mediates NK cell adhesion and triggers NK cell effector functions. Binds two different NK cell receptors: CD96 and CD226. These interactions accumulates at the cell-cell contact site, leading to the formation of a mature immunological synapse between NK cell and target cell. This may trigger adhesion and secretion of lytic granules and IFN-gamma and activate cytotoxicity of activated NK cells. May also promote NK cell-target cell modular exchange, and PVR transfer to the NK cell. This transfer is more important in some tumor cells expressing a lot of PVR, and may trigger fratricide NK cell activation, providing tumors with a mechanism of immunoevasion. Plays a role in mediating tumor cell invasion and migration.
