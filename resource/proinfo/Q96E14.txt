UniprotID	Q96E14
Accession	Q96E14;B3KVZ6;Q49AE2;Q8TBL0
EntryName	RMI2_HUMAN
ProteinName	RecQ-mediated genome instability protein 2 (hRMI2) (BLM-associated protein of 18 kDa) (BLAP18)
GeneName	RMI2 C16orf75
Length	147
Function	Essential component of the RMI complex, a complex that plays an important role in the processing of homologous recombination intermediates. It is required to regulate sister chromatid segregation and to limit DNA crossover. Essential for the stability, localization, and function of BLM, TOP3A, and complexes containing BLM. In the RMI complex, it is required to target BLM to chromatin and stress-induced nuclear foci and mitotic phosphorylation of BLM.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
