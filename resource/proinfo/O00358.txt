UniprotID	O00358
Accession	O00358;O75765;Q5T109;Q99526
EntryName	FOXE1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Forkhead box protein E1 (Forkhead box protein E2) (Forkhead-related protein FKHL15) (HFKH4) (HNF-3/fork head-like protein 5) (HFKL5) (Thyroid transcription factor 2) (TTF-2)
GeneName	FOXE1 FKHL15 FOXE2 TITF2 TTF2
Length	373
Function	Transcription factor that binds consensus sites on a variety of gene promoters and activate their transcription. Involved in proper palate formation, most probably through the expression of MSX1 and TGFB3 genes which are direct targets of this transcription factor. Also implicated in thyroid gland morphogenesis. May indirectly play a role in cell growth and migration through the regulation of WNT5A expression.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
