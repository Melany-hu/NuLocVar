UniprotID	Q9ULI2
Accession	Q9ULI2;B7Z834;D3DUV2;Q8N4P4;Q8WTW6
EntryName	RIMKB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-citrylglutamate synthase B (EC 6.3.1.17) (N-acetyl-aspartylglutamate synthetase B) (NAAG synthetase B) (NAAGS) (EC 6.3.2.41) (Ribosomal protein S6 modification-like protein B)
GeneName	RIMKLB FAM80B KIAA1238
Length	386
Function	Catalyzes the synthesis of beta-citryl-L-glutamate and N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate. Beta-citryl-L-glutamate is synthesized more efficiently than N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate.
