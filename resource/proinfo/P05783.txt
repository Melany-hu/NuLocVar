EntryName	K1C18_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin, type I cytoskeletal 18 (Cell proliferation-inducing gene 46 protein) (Cytokeratin-18) (CK-18) (Keratin-18) (K18)
GeneName	KRT18 CYK18 PIG46
Length	430
Function	Involved in the uptake of thrombin-antithrombin complexes by hepatic cells (By similarity). When phosphorylated, plays a role in filament reorganization. Involved in the delivery of mutated CFTR to the plasma membrane. Together with KRT8, is involved in interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated barrier protection.
