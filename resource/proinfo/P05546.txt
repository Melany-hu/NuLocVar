UniprotID	P05546
Accession	P05546;A0A7H0TJC6;B2RAI1;D3DX34;Q6IBZ5
EntryName	HEP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heparin cofactor 2 (Heparin cofactor II) (HC-II) (Protease inhibitor leuserpin-2) (HLS2) (Serpin D1)
GeneName	SERPIND1 HCF2
Length	499
Function	Thrombin inhibitor activated by the glycosaminoglycans, heparin or dermatan sulfate. In the presence of the latter, HC-II becomes the predominant thrombin inhibitor in place of antithrombin III (AT-III). Also inhibits chymotrypsin, but in a glycosaminoglycan-independent manner.
