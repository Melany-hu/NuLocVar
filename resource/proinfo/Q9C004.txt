UniprotID	Q9C004
Accession	Q9C004;A4FVB2;A4FVB3;Q6QIX2;Q9C003
EntryName	SPY4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein sprouty homolog 4 (Spry-4)
GeneName	SPRY4
Length	299
Function	Suppresses the insulin receptor and EGFR-transduced MAPK signaling pathway, but does not inhibit MAPK activation by a constitutively active mutant Ras (PubMed:12027893). Probably impairs the formation of GTP-Ras (PubMed:12027893). Inhibits Ras-independent, but not Ras-dependent, activation of RAF1 (PubMed:12717443). Represses integrin-mediated cell spreading via inhibition of TESK1-mediated phosphorylation of cofilin (PubMed:15584898).
