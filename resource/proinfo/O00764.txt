Accession	O00764;Q7Z2Y0;Q9BS02
EntryName	PDXK_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pyridoxal kinase (EC 2.7.1.35) (Pyridoxine kinase)
GeneName	PDXK C21orf124 C21orf97 PKH PNK PRED79
Length	312
Function	Catalyzes the phosphorylation of the dietary vitamin B6 vitamers pyridoxal (PL), pyridoxine (PN) and pyridoxamine (PM) to form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP), respectively (Probable) (PubMed:10987144, PubMed:17766369, PubMed:19351586, PubMed:31187503, PubMed:9099727). PLP is the active form of vitamin B6, and acts as a cofactor for over 140 different enzymatic reactions.
