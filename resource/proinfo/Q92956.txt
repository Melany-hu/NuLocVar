EntryName	TNR14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 14 (Herpes virus entry mediator A) (Herpesvirus entry mediator A) (HveA) (Tumor necrosis factor receptor-like 2) (TR2) (CD antigen CD270)
GeneName	TNFRSF14 HVEA HVEM UNQ329/PRO509
Length	283
Function	Receptor for four distinct ligands: The TNF superfamily members TNFSF14/LIGHT and homotrimeric LTA/lymphotoxin-alpha and the immunoglobulin superfamily members BTLA and CD160, altogether defining a complex stimulatory and inhibitory signaling network (PubMed:10754304, PubMed:18193050, PubMed:23761635, PubMed:9462508). Signals via the TRAF2-TRAF3 E3 ligase pathway to promote immune cell survival and differentiation (PubMed:19915044, PubMed:9153189, PubMed:9162022). Participates in bidirectional cell-cell contact signaling between antigen presenting cells and lymphocytes. In response to ligation of TNFSF14/LIGHT, delivers costimulatory signals to T cells, promoting cell proliferation and effector functions (PubMed:10754304). Interacts with CD160 on NK cells, enhancing IFNG production and anti-tumor immune response (PubMed:23761635). In the context of bacterial infection, acts as a signaling receptor on epithelial cells for CD160 from intraepithelial lymphocytes, triggering the production of antimicrobial proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines (By similarity). Upon binding to CD160 on activated CD4+ T cells, down-regulates CD28 costimulatory signaling, restricting memory and alloantigen-specific immune response (PubMed:18193050). May interact in cis (on the same cell) or in trans (on other cells) with BTLA (By similarity) (PubMed:19915044). In cis interactions, appears to play an immune regulatory role inhibiting in trans interactions in naive T cells to maintain a resting state. In trans interactions, can predominate during adaptive immune response to provide survival signals to effector T cells (By similarity) (PubMed:19915044).
