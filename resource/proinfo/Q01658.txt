UniprotID	Q01658
Accession	Q01658
EntryName	NC2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Dr1 (Down-regulator of transcription 1) (Negative cofactor 2-beta) (NC2-beta) (TATA-binding protein-associated phosphoprotein)
GeneName	DR1
Length	176
Function	The association of the DR1/DRAP1 heterodimer with TBP results in a functional repression of both activated and basal transcription of class II genes. This interaction precludes the formation of a transcription-competent complex by inhibiting the association of TFIIA and/or TFIIB with TBP. Can bind to DNA on its own. Component of the ATAC complex, a complex with histone acetyltransferase activity on histones H3 and H4.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
