EntryName	DX39B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Spliceosome RNA helicase DDX39B (EC 3.6.4.13) (56 kDa U2AF65-associated protein) (ATP-dependent RNA helicase p47) (DEAD box protein UAP56) (HLA-B-associated transcript 1 protein)
GeneName	DDX39B BAT1 UAP56
Length	428
Function	Involved in nuclear export of spliced and unspliced mRNA (PubMed:15833825, PubMed:15998806, PubMed:17190602). Component of the TREX complex which is thought to couple mRNA transcription, processing and nuclear export, and specifically associates with spliced mRNA and not with unspliced pre-mRNA (PubMed:15833825, PubMed:15998806, PubMed:17190602). The TREX complex is recruited to spliced mRNAs by a transcription-independent mechanism, binds to mRNA upstream of the exon-junction complex (EJC) and is recruited in a splicing- and cap-dependent manner to a region near the 5' end of the mRNA where it functions in mRNA export to the cytoplasm via the TAP/NXF1 pathway (PubMed:15833825, PubMed:15998806, PubMed:17190602). The THOC1-THOC2-THOC3 core complex alone is sufficient to promote ATPase activity of DDX39B; in the complex THOC2 is the only component that directly interacts with DDX39B (PubMed:33191911). Associates with SARNP/CIP29, which facilitates RNA binding of DDX39B and likely plays a role in mRNA export (PubMed:37578863). May undergo several rounds of ATP hydrolysis during assembly of TREX to drive subsequent loading of components such as ALYREF/THOC4 and CHTOP onto mRNA. Also associates with pre-mRNA independent of ALYREF/THOC4. Involved in the nuclear export of intronless mRNA; the ATP-bound form is proposed to recruit export adapter ALYREF/THOC4 to intronless mRNA; its ATPase activity is cooperatively stimulated by RNA and ALYREF/THOC4 and ATP hydrolysis is thought to trigger the dissociation from RNA to allow the association of ALYREF/THOC4 and the NXF1-NXT1 heterodimer. Involved in transcription elongation and genome stability.
