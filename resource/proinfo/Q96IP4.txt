EntryName	TET5A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Terminal nucleotidyltransferase 5A (EC 2.7.7.19) (HBV X-transactivated gene 11 protein) (HBV XAg-transactivated protein 11)
GeneName	TENT5A C6orf37 FAM46A XTP11
Length	442
Function	Cytoplasmic non-canonical poly(A) RNA polymerase that catalyzes the transfer of one adenosine molecule from an ATP to an mRNA poly(A) tail bearing a 3'-OH terminal group and participates in the cytoplasmic polyadenylation (PubMed:33882302). Polyadenylates mRNA encoding extracellular matrix constituents and other genes crucial for bone mineralization and during osteoblast mineralization, mainly focuses on ER-targeted mRNAs (By similarity).
