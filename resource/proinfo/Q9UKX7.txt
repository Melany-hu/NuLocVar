EntryName	NUP50_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nuclear pore complex protein Nup50 (50 kDa nucleoporin) (Nuclear pore-associated protein 60 kDa-like) (Nucleoporin Nup50)
GeneName	NUP50 NPAP60L PRO1146
Length	468
Function	Component of the nuclear pore complex that has a direct role in nuclear protein import (PubMed:20016008). Actively displaces NLSs from importin-alpha, and facilitates disassembly of the importin-alpha:beta-cargo complex and importin recycling (PubMed:20016008). Interacts with regulatory proteins of cell cycle progression including CDKN1B (By similarity). This interaction is required for correct intracellular transport and degradation of CDKN1B (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nuclear pore complex; Nucleus membrane
