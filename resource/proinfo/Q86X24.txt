EntryName	HORM1_HUMAN
ProteinName	HORMA domain-containing protein 1 (Cancer/testis antigen 46) (CT46) (Newborn ovary HORMA protein)
GeneName	HORMAD1 NOHMA
Length	394
Function	Plays a key role in meiotic progression. Regulates 3 different functions during meiosis: ensures that sufficient numbers of processed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are available for successful homology search by increasing the steady-state numbers of single-stranded DSB ends. Promotes synaptonemal-complex formation independently of its role in homology search. Plays a key role in the male mid-pachytene checkpoint and the female meiotic prophase checkpoint: required for efficient build-up of ATR activity on unsynapsed chromosome regions, a process believed to form the basis of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC) and meiotic prophase quality control in both sexes.
