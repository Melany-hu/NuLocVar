UniprotID	P18827
Accession	P18827;D6W523;Q53QV0;Q546D3;Q96HB7
EntryName	SDC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Syndecan-1 (SYND1) (CD antigen CD138)
GeneName	SDC1 SDC
Length	310
Function	Cell surface proteoglycan that contains both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate and that links the cytoskeleton to the interstitial matrix (By similarity). Regulates exosome biogenesis in concert with SDCBP and PDCD6IP (PubMed:22660413). Able to induce its own expression in dental mesenchymal cells and also in the neighboring dental epithelial cells via an MSX1-mediated pathway (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Secreted; Secreted; Extracellular exosome
