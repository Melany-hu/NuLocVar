UniprotID	O15131
Accession	O15131;B2RAI5;Q86X23
EntryName	IMA6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Importin subunit alpha-6 (Karyopherin subunit alpha-5)
GeneName	KPNA5
Length	539
Function	Functions in nuclear protein import as an adapter protein for nuclear receptor KPNB1. Binds specifically and directly to substrates containing either a simple or bipartite NLS motif. Docking of the importin/substrate complex to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by KPNB1 through binding to nucleoporin FxFG repeats and the complex is subsequently translocated through the pore by an energy requiring, Ran-dependent mechanism. At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to importin-beta and the three components separate and importin-alpha and -beta are re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran from importin. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Mediates nuclear import of STAT1 homodimers and STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers by recognizing non-classical NLSs of STAT1 and STAT2 through ARM repeats 8-9. Recognizes influenza A virus nucleoprotein through ARM repeat 7-9 In vitro, mediates the nuclear import of human cytomegalovirus UL84 by recognizing a non-classical NLS.
