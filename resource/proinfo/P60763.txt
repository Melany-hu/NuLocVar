UniprotID	P60763
Accession	P60763;O14658;Q5U0M8
EntryName	RAC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 3 (EC 3.6.5.2) (p21-Rac3)
GeneName	RAC3
Length	192
Function	Plasma membrane-associated small GTPase which cycles between an active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound state. In active state binds to a variety of effector proteins to regulate cellular responses, such as cell spreading and the formation of actin-based protusions including lamellipodia and membrane ruffles. Promotes cell adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen in a CIB1 and alpha-IIb/beta3 integrin-mediated manner.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Endomembrane system; Cell projection; Lamellipodium; Cytoplasm; Perinuclear region; Cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
