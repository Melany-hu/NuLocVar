UniprotID	Q14493
Accession	Q14493;B3KRJ5
EntryName	SLBP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone RNA hairpin-binding protein (Histone stem-loop-binding protein)
GeneName	SLBP HBP
Length	270
Function	RNA-binding protein involved in the histone pre-mRNA processing (PubMed:12588979, PubMed:19155325, PubMed:8957003, PubMed:9049306). Binds the stem-loop structure of replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs and contributes to efficient 3'-end processing by stabilizing the complex between histone pre-mRNA and U7 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), via the histone downstream element (HDE) (PubMed:12588979, PubMed:19155325, PubMed:8957003, PubMed:9049306). Plays an important role in targeting mature histone mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and to the translation machinery (PubMed:12588979, PubMed:19155325, PubMed:8957003, PubMed:9049306). Stabilizes mature histone mRNA and could be involved in cell-cycle regulation of histone gene expression (PubMed:12588979, PubMed:19155325, PubMed:8957003, PubMed:9049306). Involved in the mechanism by which growing oocytes accumulate histone proteins that support early embryogenesis (By similarity). Binds to the 5' side of the stem-loop structure of histone pre-mRNAs (By similarity).
