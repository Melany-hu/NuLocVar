UniprotID	Q9NX24
Accession	Q9NX24;A6NKY8;Q9P095
EntryName	NHP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex subunit 2 (Nucleolar protein family A member 2) (snoRNP protein NHP2)
GeneName	NHP2 NOLA2 HSPC286
Length	153
Function	Required for ribosome biogenesis and telomere maintenance. Part of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (H/ACA snoRNP) complex, which catalyzes pseudouridylation of rRNA. This involves the isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is subsequently attached to C5, instead of the normal N1. Each rRNA can contain up to 100 pseudouridine ('psi') residues, which may serve to stabilize the conformation of rRNAs. May also be required for correct processing or intranuclear trafficking of TERC, the RNA component of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) holoenzyme.
