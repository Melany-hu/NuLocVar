UniprotID	Q96E09
Accession	Q96E09
EntryName	PBIR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	PPP2R1A-PPP2R2A-interacting phosphatase regulator 1 (PABIR family member 1)
GeneName	PABIR1 C9orf42 FAM122A
Length	287
Function	Acts as an inhibitor of serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity (PubMed:27588481, PubMed:33108758, PubMed:38123684). Inhibits PP2A activity by blocking the substrate binding site on PPP2R2A and the active site of PPP2CA (PubMed:38123684). Potentiates ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit alpha (PPP2CA) (PubMed:27588481). Inhibits PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of WEE1, promoting ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of WEE1, thereby releasing G2/M checkpoint (PubMed:33108758).
