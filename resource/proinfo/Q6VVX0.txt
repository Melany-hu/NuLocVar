EntryName	CP2R1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Vitamin D 25-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.14.24) (Cytochrome P450 2R1)
GeneName	CYP2R1
Length	501
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in activation of vitamin D precursors. Catalyzes hydroxylation at C-25 of both forms of vitamin D, vitamin D(2) and D(3) (calciol) (PubMed:12867411, PubMed:15465040, PubMed:18511070). Can metabolize vitamin D analogs/prodrugs 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D(2) (doxercalciferol) and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (alfacalcidol) forming 25-hydroxy derivatives (PubMed:15465040, PubMed:18511070). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR; NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:12867411, PubMed:15465040, PubMed:18511070).
