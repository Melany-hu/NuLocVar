EntryName	ASB4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ankyrin repeat and SOCS box protein 4 (ASB-4)
GeneName	ASB4
Length	426
Function	Probable substrate-recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin-Cullin-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Promotes differentiation and maturation of the vascular lineage by an oxygen-dependent mechanism (By similarity). Also acts as a negative regulator of GPS1, a component of the COP9 signalosome (CSN) multiprotein complex, thereby inhibiting the serine phosphorylation of IRS1 (By similarity). Regulates IRS4 levels by directing its degradation via ubiquitination and thereby decreases the downstream signal of IRS4 (PubMed:21955513). Plays a critical role during early vascular development and proper placentation. Mechanistically, negatively regulates the transcriptional regulator inhibitor of DNA binding 2/ID2 expression through polyubiquitination and proteasome dependent degradation (PubMed:24586788).
