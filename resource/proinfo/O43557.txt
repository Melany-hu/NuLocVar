UniprotID	O43557
Accession	O43557;A8K7M2;C9J5H4;O75476;Q6FHA1;Q8WVF8;Q96LD2
EntryName	TNF14_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14 (Herpes virus entry mediator ligand) (HVEM-L) (Herpesvirus entry mediator ligand) (CD antigen CD258) [Cleaved into: Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14, membrane form; Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14, soluble form]
GeneName	TNFSF14 HVEML LIGHT UNQ391/PRO726
Length	240
Function	Cytokine that binds to TNFRSF3/LTBR. Binding to the decoy receptor TNFRSF6B modulates its effects. Acts as a ligand for TNFRSF14/HVEM (PubMed:10754304, PubMed:9462508). Upon binding to TNFRSF14/HVEM, delivers costimulatory signals to T cells, leading to T cell proliferation and IFNG production (PubMed:10754304).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted; Cytoplasm
