EntryName	KAT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kynurenine--oxoglutarate transaminase 1 (EC 2.6.1.7) (Cysteine-S-conjugate beta-lyase) (EC 4.4.1.13) (Glutamine transaminase K) (GTK) (Glutamine--phenylpyruvate transaminase) (EC 2.6.1.64) (Kynurenine aminotransferase 1) (Kynurenine aminotransferase I) (KATI) (Kynurenine--oxoglutarate transaminase I)
GeneName	KYAT1 CCBL1
Length	422
Function	Catalyzes the irreversible transamination of the L-tryptophan metabolite L-kynurenine to form kynurenic acid (KA), an intermediate in the tryptophan catabolic pathway which is also a broad spectrum antagonist of the three ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptors among others (PubMed:19338303, PubMed:28097769). Also metabolizes the cysteine conjugates of certain halogenated alkenes and alkanes to form reactive metabolites (PubMed:7883047). Catalyzes the beta-elimination of S-conjugates and Se-conjugates of L-(seleno)cysteine, resulting in the cleavage of the C-S or C-Se bond (PubMed:7883047).
