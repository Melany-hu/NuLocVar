UniprotID	O60760
Accession	O60760;Q6FHT9
EntryName	HPGDS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (H-PGDS) (EC 5.3.99.2) (GST class-sigma) (Glutathione S-transferase) (EC 2.5.1.18) (Glutathione-dependent PGD synthase) (Glutathione-requiring prostaglandin D synthase) (Prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase)
GeneName	HPGDS GSTS PGDS PTGDS2
Length	199
Function	Bifunctional enzyme which catalyzes both the conversion of PGH2 to PGD2, a prostaglandin involved in smooth muscle contraction/relaxation and a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation, and the conjugation of glutathione with a wide range of aryl halides and organic isothiocyanates. Also exhibits low glutathione-peroxidase activity towards cumene hydroperoxide.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
