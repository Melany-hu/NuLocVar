EntryName	S13A5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Na(+)/citrate cotransporter (NaCT) (Sodium-coupled citrate transporter) (Sodium-dependent citrate transporter) (Solute carrier family 13 member 5)
GeneName	SLC13A5 NACT
Length	568
Function	High-affinity sodium/citrate cotransporter that mediates the entry of citrate into cells, which is a critical participant of biochemical pathways (PubMed:12445824, PubMed:12826022, PubMed:26324167, PubMed:26384929, PubMed:30054523, PubMed:33597751). May function in various metabolic processes in which citrate has a critical role such as energy production (Krebs cycle), fatty acid synthesis, cholesterol synthesis, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis (PubMed:12826022). Transports citrate into the cell in a Na(+)-dependent manner, recognizing the trivalent form of citrate (physiological pH) rather than the divalent form (PubMed:12445824, PubMed:12826022, PubMed:26324167, PubMed:26384929, PubMed:30054523, PubMed:33597751). Can recognize succinate as a substrate, but its affinity for succinate is several fold lower than for citrate (PubMed:26324167). The stoichiometry is probably 4 Na(+) for each carboxylate, irrespective of whether the translocated substrate is divalent or trivalent, rendering the process electrogenic (PubMed:12445824, PubMed:12826022). Involved in the regulation of citrate levels in the brain (By similarity).
