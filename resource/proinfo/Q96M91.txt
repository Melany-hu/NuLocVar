UniprotID	Q96M91
Accession	Q96M91;B4DXT1
EntryName	CFA53_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 53 (Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 11)
GeneName	CFAP53 CCDC11
Length	514
Function	Microtubule inner protein (MIP) part of the dynein-decorated doublet microtubules (DMTs) in cilia axoneme, which is required for motile cilia beating (PubMed:36191189). Regulates motility patterns of both 9+0 and 9+2 motile cilia through differential localization and recruitment of axonemal dynein components (By similarity). Required for centriolar satellite integrity and non-motile cilium assembly (PubMed:26538025). Required for motile cilium formation (PubMed:26538025). Through its role in the beating of primary cilia, involved in the establishment of organ laterality during embryogenesis (PubMed:26531781). Required for sperm flagellum biogenesis and is essential for male fertility (By similarity).
