ProteinName	Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 10 (EC 2.8.2.-) (HNK-1 sulfotransferase) (HNK-1ST) (HNK1ST) (HuHNK-1ST)
GeneName	CHST10
Length	356
Function	Catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate (PAPS) to position 3 of terminal glucuronic acid of both protein- and lipid-linked oligosaccharides. Participates in biosynthesis of HNK-1 carbohydrate structure 3-O-sulfo-beta-D-GlcA-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-GlcNAc-R, a sulfated glucuronyl-lactosaminyl residue carried by many neural recognition molecules, which is involved in cell interactions during ontogenetic development and in synaptic plasticity in the adult. May be indirectly involved in synapse plasticity of the hippocampus, via its role in HNK-1 biosynthesis (PubMed:9478973). Sulfates terminal glucuronyl residue of the laminin globular (LG)-domain binding epitope on DAG1/alpha-dystroglycan and prevents further polymerization by LARGE1 glycosyltransferase. Likely defines the chain length of LG epitope, conferring binding specificity to extracellular matrix components (PubMed:32149355). Plays a role in down-regulating the steroid hormones. Sulfates glucuronidated estrogens and androgens with an impact in hormone cycle and fertility. Has a preference for glucuronyl moiety at the 3-hydroxyl group of a sterol ring rather than the 17-hydroxyl group, showing high catalytic efficiency for 17beta-estradiol 3-O-(beta-D-glucuronate) and dehydroepiandrosterone 3-O-(beta-D-glucuronate) hormones (PubMed:23269668).
