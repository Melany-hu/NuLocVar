UniprotID	Q8WW43
Accession	Q8WW43;A8K589;Q564N3;Q6UWQ1;Q9H0S0
EntryName	APH1B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-secretase subunit APH-1B (APH-1b) (Aph-1beta) (Presenilin-stabilization factor-like)
GeneName	APH1B PSFL UNQ688/PRO1328
Length	257
Function	Probable subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, an endoprotease complex that catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of integral proteins such as Notch receptors and APP (amyloid-beta precursor protein). It probably represents a stabilizing cofactor for the presenilin homodimer that promotes the formation of a stable complex. Probably present in a minority of gamma-secretase complexes compared to APH1A.
