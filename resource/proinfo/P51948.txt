UniprotID	P51948
Accession	P51948;G3V1U8;Q15817;Q6ICQ7
EntryName	MAT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	CDK-activating kinase assembly factor MAT1 (CDK7/cyclin-H assembly factor) (Cyclin-G1-interacting protein) (Menage a trois) (RING finger protein 66) (RING finger protein MAT1) (p35) (p36)
GeneName	MNAT1 CAP35 MAT1 RNF66
Length	309
Function	Stabilizes the cyclin H-CDK7 complex to form a functional CDK-activating kinase (CAK) enzymatic complex. CAK activates the cyclin-associated kinases CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 by threonine phosphorylation. CAK complexed to the core-TFIIH basal transcription factor activates RNA polymerase II by serine phosphorylation of the repetitive C-terminal domain (CTD) of its large subunit (POLR2A), allowing its escape from the promoter and elongation of the transcripts. Involved in cell cycle control and in RNA transcription by RNA polymerase II.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
