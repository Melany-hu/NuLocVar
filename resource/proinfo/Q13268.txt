EntryName	DHRS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 2, mitochondrial (EC 1.1.1.-) (Dicarbonyl reductase HEP27) (Protein D) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 25C member 1) (Protein SDR25C1)
GeneName	DHRS2 SDR25C1
Length	280
Function	NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase which catalyzes the reduction of dicarbonyl compounds. Displays reductase activity in vitro with 3,4-hexanedione, 2,3-heptanedione and 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione as substrates (PubMed:16685466). May function as a dicarbonyl reductase in the enzymatic inactivation of reactive carbonyls involved in covalent modification of cellular components (PubMed:16685466). Also displays a minor hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity toward bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and isoursodeoxycholic acid (isoUDCA), which makes it unlikely to control hormone levels (PubMed:16685466). Doesn't show any activity in vitro with retinoids and sugars as substrates (PubMed:16685466). Attenuates MDM2-mediated p53/TP53 degradation, leading to p53/TP53 stabilization and increased transcription activity, resulting in the accumulation of MDM2 and CDKN1A/p21 (PubMed:20547751). Reduces proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells and well as the production of ROS in cancer (PubMed:29106393).
