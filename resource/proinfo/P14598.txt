EntryName	NCF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Neutrophil cytosol factor 1 (NCF-1) (47 kDa autosomal chronic granulomatous disease protein) (47 kDa neutrophil oxidase factor) (NCF-47K) (Neutrophil NADPH oxidase factor 1) (Nox organizer 2) (Nox-organizing protein 2) (SH3 and PX domain-containing protein 1A) (p47-phox)
GeneName	NCF1 NOXO2 SH3PXD1A
Length	390
Function	Subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex that mediates the transfer of electrons from cytosolic NADPH to O2 to produce the superoxide anion (O2(-)) (PubMed:2547247, PubMed:2550933, PubMed:38355798). In the activated complex, electrons are first transferred from NADPH to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and subsequently transferred via two heme molecules to molecular oxygen, producing superoxide through an outer-sphere reaction (PubMed:38355798). Activation of the NADPH oxidase complex is initiated by the assembly of cytosolic subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex with the core NADPH oxidase complex to form a complex at the plasma membrane or phagosomal membrane (PubMed:38355798). This activation process is initiated by phosphorylation dependent binding of the cytosolic NCF1/p47-phox subunit to the C-terminus of CYBA/p22-phox (PubMed:12732142, PubMed:19801500).
