Accession	Q13325;B2R5X9;B4DDV1;Q5T7I9;Q6IAX3
EntryName	IFIT5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 5 (IFIT-5) (Interferon-induced 58 kDa protein) (Retinoic acid- and interferon-inducible 58 kDa protein) (P58)
GeneName	IFIT5 ISG58 RI58
Length	482
Function	Interferon-induced RNA-binding protein involved in the human innate immune response. Has a broad and adaptable RNA structure recognition important for RNA recognition specificity in antiviral defense. Binds precursor and processed tRNAs as well as poly-U-tailed tRNA fragments (PubMed:23317505, PubMed:23774268, PubMed:25092312). Specifically binds single-stranded RNA bearing a 5'-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), thereby acting as a sensor of viral single-stranded RNAs. Single-stranded PPP-RNAs, which lack 2'-O-methylation of the 5' cap and bear a 5'-triphosphate group instead, are specific from viruses, providing a molecular signature to distinguish between self and non-self mRNAs by the host during viral infection. Directly binds PPP-RNA in a non-sequence-specific manner (PubMed:23334420). Also recognizes and selectively binds AT-rich dsDNA (PubMed:23774268). Additionally, as a mediator in innate immunity, positively regulates IKK-NFKB signaling by sinergizing the recruitment of IKK to MAP3K7 (PubMed:26334375).
