UniprotID	P11161
Accession	P11161;B2R724;B3KRD7;Q68CZ5;Q8IV26;Q9UNA6
EntryName	EGR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 SUMO-protein ligase EGR2 (EC 2.3.2.-) (AT591) (E3 SUMO-protein transferase ERG2) (Early growth response protein 2) (EGR-2) (Zinc finger protein Krox-20)
GeneName	EGR2 KROX20
Length	476
Function	Sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factor (PubMed:17717711). Plays a role in hindbrain segmentation by regulating the expression of a subset of homeobox containing genes and in Schwann cell myelination by regulating the expression of genes involved in the formation and maintenance of myelin (By similarity). Binds to two EGR2-consensus sites EGR2A (5'-CTGTAGGAG-3') and EGR2B (5'-ATGTAGGTG-3') in the HOXB3 enhancer and promotes HOXB3 transcriptional activation (By similarity). Binds to specific DNA sites located in the promoter region of HOXA4, HOXB2 and ERBB2 (By similarity). Regulates hindbrain segmentation by controlling the expression of Hox genes, such as HOXA4, HOXB3 and HOXB2, and thereby specifying odd and even rhombomeres (By similarity). Promotes the expression of HOXB3 in the rhombomere r5 in the hindbrain (By similarity). Regulates myelination in the peripheral nervous system after birth, possibly by regulating the expression of myelin proteins, such as MPZ, and by promoting the differentiation of Schwann cells (By similarity). Involved in the development of the jaw openener musculature, probably by playing a role in its innervation through trigeminal motor neurons (By similarity). May play a role in adipogenesis, possibly by regulating the expression of CEBPB (By similarity).
