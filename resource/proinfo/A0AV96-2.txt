UniprotID	A0AV96-2
Accession	A0AV96;A0PJK2;B5MED4;Q8NI52;Q8NI53;Q9NXG3
EntryName	RBM47_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA-binding protein 47 (RNA-binding motif protein 47)
GeneName	RBM47
Length	524
Function	Single-stranded RNA-binding protein that functions in a variety of RNA processes, including alternative splicing, RNA stabilization, and RNA editing (PubMed:24038582, PubMed:24916387, PubMed:27050523, PubMed:30844405, PubMed:31358901, PubMed:34160127). Functions as an enzyme-substrate adapter for the cytidine deaminase APOBEC1. With APOBEC1 forms an mRNA editing complex involved into cytidine to uridine editing of a variety of mRNA molecules (PubMed:24038582, PubMed:24916387, PubMed:30844405). Through the binding of their 3'UTR, also stabilizes a variety of mRNAs and regulates the expression of genes such as the interferon alpha/beta receptor and interleukin-10 (PubMed:34160127). Also involved in the alternative splicing of several genes including TJP1. Binds the pre-mRNA (U)GCAUG consensus sequences in downstream intronic regions of alternative exons, regulating their exclusion and inclusion into mRNAs (PubMed:27050523, PubMed:31358901). Independently of its RNA-binding activity, could negatively regulate MAVS by promoting its lysosomal degradation (By similarity).
