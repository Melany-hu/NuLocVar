EntryName	ABHDA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase ABHD10, mitochondrial (EC 3.1.2.22) (Acyl-protein thioesterase ABHD10) (Alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 10) (Abhydrolase domain-containing protein 10) (Mycophenolic acid acyl-glucuronide esterase, mitochondrial) (EC 3.1.1.93)
GeneName	ABHD10
Length	306
Function	Acts as an acyl-protein thioesterase that hydrolyzes fatty acids from acylated residues in proteins (PubMed:31740833). Regulates the mitochondrial S-depalmitoylation of the nucleophilic active site residue of peroxiredoxin-5/PRDX5, a key antioxidant protein, therefore modulating mitochondrial antioxidant ability (PubMed:31740833). Also catalyzes the deglucuronidation of mycophenolic acid acyl-glucuronide, an active metabolite of the immunosuppressant drug mycophenolate (PubMed:22294686).
