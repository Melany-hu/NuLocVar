UniprotID	O43772
Accession	O43772;B2R7F4;Q9UIQ2
EntryName	MCAT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier protein (Carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase) (CAC) (CACT) (Solute carrier family 25 member 20)
GeneName	SLC25A20 CAC CACT
Length	301
Function	Mediates the electroneutral exchange of acylcarnitines (O-acyl-(R)-carnitine or L-acylcarnitine) of different acyl chain lengths (ranging from O-acetyl-(R)-carnitine to long-chain O-acyl-(R)-carnitines) with free carnitine ((R)-carnitine or L-carnitine) across the mitochondrial inner membrane, via a ping-pong mechanism (Probable) (PubMed:12892634, PubMed:18307102). Key player in the mitochondrial oxidation pathway, it translocates the fatty acids in the form of acylcarnitines into the mitochondrial matrix, where the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT-2) activates them to undergo fatty acid beta-oxidation (Probable). Catalyzes the unidirectional transport (uniport) of carnitine at lower rates than the antiport (exchange) (PubMed:18307102).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
