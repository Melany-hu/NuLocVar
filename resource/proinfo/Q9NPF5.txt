EntryName	DMAP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein 1 (DNMAP1) (DNMT1-associated protein 1)
GeneName	DMAP1 KIAA1425
Length	467
Function	Involved in transcription repression and activation. Its interaction with HDAC2 may provide a mechanism for histone deacetylation in heterochromatin following replication of DNA at late firing origins. Can also repress transcription independently of histone deacetylase activity. May specifically potentiate DAXX-mediated repression of glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcription. Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex which is involved in transcriptional activation of select genes principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histones H4 and H2A. This modification may both alter nucleosome - DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription. This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence, apoptosis, and DNA repair. NuA4 may also play a direct role in DNA repair when recruited to sites of DNA damage. Participates in the nuclear localization of URI1 and increases its transcriptional corepressor activity.
