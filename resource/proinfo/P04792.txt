UniprotID	P04792
Accession	P04792;B2R4N8;Q6FI47;Q96C20;Q96EI7;Q9UC31;Q9UC34;Q9UC35;Q9UC36
EntryName	HSPB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Heat shock protein beta-1 (HspB1) (28 kDa heat shock protein) (Estrogen-regulated 24 kDa protein) (Heat shock 27 kDa protein) (HSP 27) (Heat shock protein family B member 1) (Stress-responsive protein 27) (SRP27)
GeneName	HSPB1 HSP27 HSP28
Length	205
Function	Small heat shock protein which functions as a molecular chaperone probably maintaining denatured proteins in a folding-competent state (PubMed:10383393, PubMed:20178975). Plays a role in stress resistance and actin organization (PubMed:19166925). Through its molecular chaperone activity may regulate numerous biological processes including the phosphorylation and the axonal transport of neurofilament proteins (PubMed:23728742).
