UniprotID	Q9P258
Accession	Q9P258;Q8IVL9;Q9BSN6;Q9NPV8
EntryName	RCC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein RCC2 (RCC1-like protein TD-60) (Telophase disk protein of 60 kDa)
GeneName	RCC2 KIAA1470 TD60
Length	522
Function	Multifunctional protein that may affect its functions by regulating the activity of small GTPases, such as RAC1 and RALA (PubMed:12919680, PubMed:25074804, PubMed:26158537, PubMed:28869598). Required for normal progress through the cell cycle, both during interphase and during mitosis (PubMed:12919680, PubMed:23388455, PubMed:26158537). Required for the presence of normal levels of MAD2L1, AURKB and BIRC5 on inner centromeres during mitosis, and for normal attachment of kinetochores to mitotic spindles (PubMed:12919680, PubMed:26158537). Required for normal organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton in interphase cells (PubMed:23388455). Functions as guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RALA (PubMed:26158537). Interferes with the activation of RAC1 by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (PubMed:25074804). Prevents accumulation of active, GTP-bound RAC1, and suppresses RAC1-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and formation of membrane protrusions (PubMed:25074804, PubMed:28869598). Required for normal cellular responses to contacts with the extracellular matrix of adjacent cells, and for directional cell migration in response to a fibronectin gradient (in vitro) (PubMed:25074804, PubMed:28869598).
