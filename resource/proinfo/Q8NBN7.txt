UniprotID	Q8NBN7
Accession	Q8NBN7;Q6UX79;Q96G88
EntryName	RDH13_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinol dehydrogenase 13 (EC 1.1.1.300) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 7C member 3)
GeneName	RDH13 SDR7C3 PSEC0082 UNQ736/PRO1430
Length	331
Function	Retinol dehydrogenase with a clear preference for NADP. Oxidizes all-trans-retinol, but seems to reduce all-trans-retinal with much higher efficiency (PubMed:18039331). Has no activity toward steroids (PubMed:18039331).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
