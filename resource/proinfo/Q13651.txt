UniprotID	Q13651
Accession	Q13651;A8K6I0;B0YJ27
EntryName	I10R1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interleukin-10 receptor subunit alpha (IL-10 receptor subunit alpha) (IL-10R subunit alpha) (IL-10RA) (CDw210a) (Interleukin-10 receptor subunit 1) (IL-10R subunit 1) (IL-10R1) (CD antigen CD210)
GeneName	IL10RA IL10R
Length	578
Function	Cell surface receptor for the cytokine IL10 that participates in IL10-mediated anti-inflammatory functions, limiting excessive tissue disruption caused by inflammation. Upon binding to IL10, induces a conformational change in IL10RB, allowing IL10RB to bind IL10 as well (PubMed:16982608). In turn, the heterotetrameric assembly complex, composed of two subunits of IL10RA and IL10RB, activates the kinases JAK1 and TYK2 that are constitutively associated with IL10RA and IL10RB respectively (PubMed:12133952). These kinases then phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain in IL10RA leading to the recruitment and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT3. Once phosphorylated, STAT3 homodimerizes, translocates to the nucleus and activates the expression of anti-inflammatory genes. In addition, IL10RA-mediated activation of STAT3 inhibits starvation-induced autophagy (PubMed:26962683).
