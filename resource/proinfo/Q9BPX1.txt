UniprotID	Q9BPX1
Accession	Q9BPX1;Q9UKU3
EntryName	DHB14_HUMAN
ProteinName	L-fucose dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.122) (17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase DHRS10) (Dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 10) (Retinal short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase retSDR3) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 47C member 1)
GeneName	HSD17B14 DHRS10 SDR3 SDR47C1 UNQ502/PRO474
Length	270
Function	Catalyzes the NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of L-fucose, yielding L-fucono-1,5-lactone, which rapidly converts spontaneously to L-fucone-1,4-lactone. Can also act on D-arabinose and L-galactose, with lower catalytic efficiency (PubMed:38944119). Does not use NADPH (PubMed:38944119). May be the initial enzyme of the L-fucose degradation pathway in mammals (PubMed:17067289, PubMed:38944119).
