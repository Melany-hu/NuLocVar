UniprotID	P60602
Accession	P60602;A7M872;E1P5R9;E9KL28;Q3MHD5;Q5QP16;Q9CQ98;Q9H1N2
EntryName	ROMO1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (ROS modulator 1) (Epididymis tissue protein Li 175) (Glyrichin) (Mitochondrial targeting GxxxG motif protein) (MTGM) (Protein MGR2 homolog)
GeneName	ROMO1 C20orf52
Length	79
Function	Induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which are necessary for cell proliferation. May play a role in inducing oxidative DNA damage and replicative senescence. May play a role in the coordination of mitochondrial morphology and cell proliferation.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
