UniprotID	Q9BYQ9
Accession	Q9BYQ9;A8MSH3
EntryName	KRA48_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 4-8 (Keratin-associated protein 4.8) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 4.8)
GeneName	KRTAP4-8 KAP4.8 KRTAP4.8
Length	185
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
