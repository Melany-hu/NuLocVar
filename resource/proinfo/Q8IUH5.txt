ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC17 (EC 2.3.1.225) (Acyltransferase ZDHHC17) (EC 2.3.1.-) (DHHC domain-containing cysteine-rich protein 17) (DHHC17) (Huntingtin yeast partner H) (Huntingtin-interacting protein 14) (HIP-14) (Huntingtin-interacting protein 3) (HIP-3) (Huntingtin-interacting protein H) (Putative MAPK-activating protein PM11) (Putative NF-kappa-B-activating protein 205) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 17)
GeneName	ZDHHC17 HIP14 HIP3 HYPH KIAA0946 HSPC294
Length	632
Function	Palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of palmitate onto various protein substrates and is involved in a variety of cellular processes (PubMed:15489887, PubMed:15603740, PubMed:24705354, PubMed:27911442, PubMed:28757145). Has no stringent fatty acid selectivity and in addition to palmitate can also transfer onto target proteins myristate from tetradecanoyl-CoA and stearate from octadecanoyl-CoA (By similarity). Palmitoyltransferase specific for a subset of neuronal proteins, including SNAP25, DLG4/PSD95, GAD2, SYT1 and HTT (PubMed:15489887, PubMed:15603740, PubMed:19139280, PubMed:28757145). Also palmitoylates neuronal protein GPM6A as well as SPRED1 and SPRED3 (PubMed:24705354). Could also play a role in axonogenesis through the regulation of NTRK1 and the downstream ERK1/ERK2 signaling cascade (By similarity). May be involved in the sorting or targeting of critical proteins involved in the initiating events of endocytosis at the plasma membrane (PubMed:12393793). May play a role in Mg(2+) transport (PubMed:18794299). Could also palmitoylate DNAJC5 and regulate its localization to the Golgi membrane (By similarity). Palmitoylates CASP6, thereby preventing its dimerization and subsequent activation (PubMed:27911442).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane; Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane; Presynaptic cell membrane
