UniprotID	Q6DKI7
Accession	Q6DKI7;D6W5U9;Q9BVK3
EntryName	PVRIG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein PVRIG (CD112 receptor) (CD112R) (Poliovirus receptor-related immunoglobulin domain-containing protein)
GeneName	PVRIG C7orf15
Length	326
Function	Cell surface receptor for NECTIN2. May act as a coinhibitory receptor that suppresses T-cell receptor-mediated signals. Following interaction with NECTIN2, inhibits T-cell proliferation. Competes with CD226 for NECTIN2-binding.
