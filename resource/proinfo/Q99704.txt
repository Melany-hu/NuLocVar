UniprotID	Q99704
Accession	Q99704;O43204;Q53TY2;Q9UHG6
EntryName	DOK1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Docking protein 1 (Downstream of tyrosine kinase 1) (p62(dok)) (pp62)
GeneName	DOK1
Length	481
Function	DOK proteins are enzymatically inert adaptor or scaffolding proteins. They provide a docking platform for the assembly of multimolecular signaling complexes. DOK1 appears to be a negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway. Modulates integrin activation by competing with talin for the same binding site on ITGB3.
