UniprotID	P05981
Accession	P05981;B2RDS4
EntryName	HEPS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Serine protease hepsin (EC 3.4.21.106) (Transmembrane protease serine 1) [Cleaved into: Serine protease hepsin non-catalytic chain; Serine protease hepsin catalytic chain]
GeneName	HPN TMPRSS1
Length	417
Function	Serine protease that cleaves extracellular substrates, and contributes to the proteolytic processing of growth factors, such as HGF and MST1/HGFL (PubMed:15839837, PubMed:21875933). Plays a role in cell growth and maintenance of cell morphology (PubMed:21875933, PubMed:8346233). Plays a role in the proteolytic processing of ACE2 (PubMed:24227843). Mediates the proteolytic cleavage of urinary UMOD that is required for UMOD polymerization (PubMed:26673890).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Apical cell membrane
