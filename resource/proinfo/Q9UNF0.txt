Length	486
Function	Regulates the morphogenesis and endocytosis of caveolae (By similarity). Lipid-binding protein that is able to promote the tubulation of the phosphatidic acid-containing membranes it preferentially binds. Plays a role in intracellular vesicle-mediated transport. Involved in the endocytosis of cell-surface receptors like the EGF receptor, contributing to its internalization in the absence of EGF stimulus (PubMed:21693584, PubMed:23129763, PubMed:23236520, PubMed:23596323). Essential for endothelial organization in sprouting angiogenesis, modulates CDH5-based junctions. Facilitates endothelial front-rear polarity during migration by recruiting EHD4 and MICALL1 to asymmetric adherens junctions between leader and follower cells (By similarity).
