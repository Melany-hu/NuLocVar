EntryName	KAT3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kynurenine--oxoglutarate transaminase 3 (EC 2.6.1.7) (Cysteine-S-conjugate beta-lyase 2) (EC 4.4.1.13) (Kynurenine aminotransferase 3) (Kynurenine aminotransferase III) (KATIII) (Kynurenine--glyoxylate transaminase) (EC 2.6.1.63) (Kynurenine--oxoglutarate transaminase III)
GeneName	KYAT3 CCBL2 KAT3
Length	454
Function	Catalyzes the irreversible transamination of the L-tryptophan metabolite L-kynurenine to form kynurenic acid (KA), an intermediate in the tryptophan catabolic pathway which is also a broad spectrum antagonist of the three ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptors among others. May catalyze the beta-elimination of S-conjugates and Se-conjugates of L-(seleno)cysteine, resulting in the cleavage of the C-S or C-Se bond. Has transaminase activity towards L-kynurenine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, serine, cysteine, methionine, histidine, glutamine and asparagine with glyoxylate as an amino group acceptor (in vitro). Has lower activity with 2-oxoglutarate as amino group acceptor (in vitro).
