Accession	A6NED2;B2RTP9;Q29RX6
EntryName	RCCD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	RCC1 domain-containing protein 1
GeneName	RCCD1
Length	376
Function	Plays a role in transcriptional repression of satellite repeats, possibly by regulating H3K36 methylation levels in centromeric regions together with KDM8 (PubMed:24981860). Possibly together with KDM8, is involved in proper mitotic spindle organization and chromosome segregation (PubMed:24981860). Plays a role in regulating alpha-tubulin deacetylation and cytoskeletal microtubule stability, thereby promoting cell migration and TGF-beta-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), potentially through the inhibition of KDM8 (PubMed:28455245).
