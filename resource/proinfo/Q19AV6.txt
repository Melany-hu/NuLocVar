UniprotID	Q19AV6
Accession	Q19AV6
EntryName	ZSWM7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger SWIM domain-containing protein 7 (SWIM domain-containing and Srs2-interacting protein 1 homolog) (SWIM-type zinc finger domain-containing protein 7)
GeneName	ZSWIM7 SWS1
Length	140
Function	Involved in early stages of the homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway of double-stranded DNA breaks arising during DNA replication or induced by DNA-damaging agents. Required for meiotic progression, hence for fertility (PubMed:32719396, PubMed:33713115, PubMed:34402903).
