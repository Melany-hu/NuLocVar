ProteinName	Sodium channel regulatory subunit beta-1
GeneName	SCN1B
Length	218
Function	Regulatory subunit of multiple voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels directly mediating the depolarization of excitable membranes. Navs, also called VGSCs (voltage-gated sodium channels) or VDSCs (voltage-dependent sodium channels), operate by switching between closed and open conformations depending on the voltage difference across the membrane. In the open conformation they allow Na(+) ions to selectively pass through the pore, along their electrochemical gradient. The influx of Na+ ions provokes membrane depolarization, initiating the propagation of electrical signals throughout cells and tissues (PubMed:14622265, PubMed:15525788, PubMed:18464934, PubMed:19710327, PubMed:29992740, PubMed:36696443, PubMed:8125980, PubMed:8394762). The accessory beta subunits participate in localization and functional modulation of the Nav channels (PubMed:15525788, PubMed:19710327, PubMed:29992740). Modulates the activity of SCN1A/Nav1.1, SCN2A/Nav1.2, SCN3A/Nav1.3, SCN4A/Nav1.4, SCN5A/Nav1.5, SCN8A/Nav1.6, SCN9A/Nav1.7 and SCN10A/Nav1.8 (PubMed:14622265, PubMed:15525788, PubMed:18464934, PubMed:30765606, PubMed:36696443, PubMed:8125980, PubMed:8394762).
