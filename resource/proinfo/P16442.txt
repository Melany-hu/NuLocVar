EntryName	BGAT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histo-blood group ABO system transferase (Fucosylglycoprotein 3-alpha-galactosyltransferase) (Fucosylglycoprotein alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase) (Glycoprotein-fucosylgalactoside alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase) (EC 2.4.1.40) (Glycoprotein-fucosylgalactoside alpha-galactosyltransferase) (EC 2.4.1.37) (Histo-blood group A transferase) (A transferase) (Histo-blood group B transferase) (B transferase) (NAGAT) [Cleaved into: Fucosylglycoprotein alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase soluble form]
GeneName	ABO
Length	354
Function	This protein is the basis of the ABO blood group system. The histo-blood group ABO involves three carbohydrate antigens: A, B, and H. A, B, and AB individuals express a glycosyltransferase activity that converts the H antigen to the A antigen (by addition of UDP-GalNAc) or to the B antigen (by addition of UDP-Gal), whereas O individuals lack such activity.
