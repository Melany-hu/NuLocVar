UniprotID	Q6P4H8
Accession	Q6P4H8;B4DT41;B4DXK2;E9PBZ4
EntryName	ACKMT_HUMAN
ProteinName	ATP synthase subunit C lysine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.-) (Protein N-lysine methyltransferase FAM173B) (hFAM173B)
GeneName	ATPSCKMT FAM173B
Length	233
Function	Mitochondrial protein-lysine N-methyltransferase that trimethylates ATP synthase subunit C, ATP5MC1 and ATP5MC2. Trimethylation is required for proper incorporation of the C subunit into the ATP synthase complex and mitochondrial respiration (PubMed:29444090, PubMed:30530489). Promotes chronic pain (PubMed:29444090). Involved in persistent inflammatory and neuropathic pain: methyltransferase activity in the mitochondria of sensory neurons promotes chronic pain via a pathway that depends on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and on the engagement of spinal cord microglia (PubMed:29444090).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion membrane
