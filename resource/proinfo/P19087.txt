UniprotID	P19087
Accession	P19087
EntryName	GNAT2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(t) subunit alpha-2 (Transducin alpha-2 chain)
GeneName	GNAT2 GNATC
Length	354
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved as modulators or transducers in various transmembrane signaling systems. Transducin is an amplifier and one of the transducers of a visual impulse that performs the coupling between rhodopsin and cGMP-phosphodiesterase.
