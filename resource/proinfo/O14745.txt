UniprotID	O14745
Accession	O14745;B3KY21;O43552;Q86WQ5
EntryName	NHRF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Na(+)/H(+) exchange regulatory cofactor NHE-RF1 (NHERF-1) (Ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50) (EBP50) (Regulatory cofactor of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger) (Sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor 1) (Solute carrier family 9 isoform A3 regulatory factor 1)
GeneName	NHERF1 NHERF SLC9A3R1
Length	358
Function	Scaffold protein that connects plasma membrane proteins with members of the ezrin/moesin/radixin family and thereby helps to link them to the actin cytoskeleton and to regulate their surface expression. Necessary for recycling of internalized ADRB2. Was first known to play a role in the regulation of the activity and subcellular location of SLC9A3. Necessary for cAMP-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of SLC9A3. May enhance Wnt signaling. May participate in HTR4 targeting to microvilli (By similarity). Involved in the regulation of phosphate reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules. Involved in sperm capacitation. May participate in the regulation of the chloride and bicarbonate homeostasis in spermatozoa.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Apical cell membrane; Endomembrane system; Cell projection; Filopodium; Cell projection; Ruffle; Cell projection; Microvillus
