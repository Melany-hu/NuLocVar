UniprotID	Q9Y462
Accession	Q9Y462;B4DSV4;Q6NX42;Q9Y4J6
EntryName	ZN711_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein 711 (Zinc finger protein 6)
GeneName	ZNF711 CMPX1 ZNF6
Length	761
Function	Transcription regulator required for brain development (PubMed:20346720). Probably acts as a transcription factor that binds to the promoter of target genes and recruits PHF8 histone demethylase, leading to activated expression of genes involved in neuron development, such as KDM5C (PubMed:20346720, PubMed:31691806). May compete with transcription factor ARX for activation of expression of KDM5C (PubMed:31691806).
