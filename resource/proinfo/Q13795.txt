Accession	Q13795;A0A087WY13;B7ZKX7;E1P5J9;Q6IBQ0;V9GYH4
EntryName	ARFRP_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor-related protein 1 (ARF-related protein 1) (ARP)
GeneName	ARFRP1 ARP1
Length	201
Function	Trans-Golgi-associated GTPase that regulates protein sorting. Controls the targeting of ARL1 and its effector to the trans-Golgi. Required for the lipidation of chylomicrons in the intestine and required for VLDL lipidation in the liver.
