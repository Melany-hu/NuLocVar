UniprotID	Q96H78
Accession	Q96H78;O75034
EntryName	S2544_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 25 member 44
GeneName	SLC25A44 KIAA0446
Length	314
Function	Mitochondrial solute transporter which transports branched-chain amino acid (BCAA; valine, leucine and isoleucine) into mitochondria in brown adipose tissue (BAT) (By similarity). BAT is involved in BCAA catabolism and actively utilizes BCAA in the mitochondria for thermogenesis (PubMed:31435015).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion membrane
