UniprotID	Q96CH1
Accession	Q96CH1;Q86SP5
EntryName	GP146_HUMAN
ProteinName	G-protein coupled receptor 146 (G-protein coupled receptor PGR8)
GeneName	GPR146 PGR8
Length	333
Function	G-protein coupled receptor required for the regulation of plasma cholesterol levels (PubMed:31778654, PubMed:38503280). Receptor for CHLSN, a gut derived hormone which mediates an inhibitory effect of intestinal cholesterol absorption on hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Cholesin-binding exerts an antagonistic effect by inhibiting PKA signaling and suppressing SREBF2-controlled cholesterol in the liver (PubMed:38503280).
