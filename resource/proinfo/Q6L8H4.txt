UniprotID	Q6L8H4
Accession	Q6L8H4
EntryName	KRA51_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 5-1 (Keratin, cuticle, ultrahigh sulphur 1-like) (Keratin-associated protein 5.1) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 5.1)
GeneName	KRTAP5-1 KAP5.1 KRN1L KRTAP5.1
Length	278
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated protein (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
