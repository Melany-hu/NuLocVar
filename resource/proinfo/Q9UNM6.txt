UniprotID	Q9UNM6
Accession	Q9UNM6;B3KT15;O75831;Q53XU2;Q9UNV3
EntryName	PSD13_HUMAN
ProteinName	26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 13 (26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN9) (26S proteasome regulatory subunit S11) (26S proteasome regulatory subunit p40.5)
GeneName	PSMD13
Length	376
Function	Component of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This complex plays a key role in the maintenance of protein homeostasis by removing misfolded or damaged proteins, which could impair cellular functions, and by removing proteins whose functions are no longer required. Therefore, the proteasome participates in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, or DNA damage repair.
