UniprotID	Q9UMX9
Accession	Q9UMX9;Q6P2P0;Q9BTM3
EntryName	S45A2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Membrane-associated transporter protein (Melanoma antigen AIM1) (Protein AIM-1) (Solute carrier family 45 member 2)
GeneName	SLC45A2 AIM1 MATP
Length	530
Function	Proton-associated glucose and sucrose transporter (By similarity). May be able to transport also fructose (By similarity). Expressed at a late melanosome maturation stage where functions as proton/glucose exporter which increase lumenal pH by decreasing glycolysis (PubMed:32966160, PubMed:35469906). Regulates melanogenesis by maintaining melanosome neutralization that is initially initiated by transient OCA2 and required for a proper function of the tyrosinase TYR (PubMed:32966160, PubMed:35469906).
Subcellular Location	Melanosome membrane
