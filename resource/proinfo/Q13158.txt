UniprotID	Q13158
Accession	Q13158;Q14866;Q6IBR4
EntryName	FADD_HUMAN
ProteinName	FAS-associated death domain protein (FAS-associating death domain-containing protein) (Growth-inhibiting gene 3 protein) (Mediator of receptor induced toxicity)
GeneName	FADD MORT1 GIG3
Length	208
Function	Apoptotic adapter molecule that recruits caspases CASP8 or CASP10 to the activated FAS/CD95 or TNFRSF1A/TNFR-1 receptors (PubMed:16762833, PubMed:19118384, PubMed:20935634, PubMed:23955153, PubMed:24025841, PubMed:7538907, PubMed:9184224). The resulting aggregate called the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) performs CASP8 proteolytic activation (PubMed:16762833, PubMed:19118384, PubMed:20935634, PubMed:7538907, PubMed:9184224). Active CASP8 initiates the subsequent cascade of caspases mediating apoptosis (PubMed:16762833). Involved in interferon-mediated antiviral immune response, playing a role in the positive regulation of interferon signaling (PubMed:21109225, PubMed:24204270).
