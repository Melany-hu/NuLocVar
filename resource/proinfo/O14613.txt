UniprotID	O14613
Accession	O14613;B2RD85;Q9UNS0
EntryName	BORG1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cdc42 effector protein 2 (Binder of Rho GTPases 1)
GeneName	CDC42EP2 BORG1 CEP2
Length	210
Function	Probably involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. May act downstream of CDC42 to induce actin filament assembly leading to cell shape changes. Induces pseudopodia formation in fibroblasts in a CDC42-dependent manner.
Subcellular Location	Endomembrane system; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton
