UniprotID	Q9GZS1
Accession	Q9GZS1;Q5VZT3;Q8NBA9;Q96L20
EntryName	RPA49_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit RPA49 (RNA polymerase I subunit A49) (DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit E) (RNA polymerase I-associated factor 1) (RNA polymerase I-associated factor 53)
GeneName	POLR1E PAF53 PRAF1
Length	419
Function	Component of RNA polymerase I (Pol I), a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which synthesizes ribosomal RNA precursors using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates (PubMed:24207024, PubMed:34671025, PubMed:34887565, PubMed:36271492). Appears to be involved in the formation of the initiation complex at the promoter by mediating the interaction between Pol I and UBTF/UBF (PubMed:24207024).
