UniprotID	Q9UBS3
Accession	Q9UBS3
EntryName	DNJB9_HUMAN
ProteinName	DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 9 (Endoplasmic reticulum DNA J domain-containing protein 4) (ER-resident protein ERdj4) (ERdj4) (Microvascular endothelial differentiation gene 1 protein) (Mdg-1)
GeneName	DNAJB9 MDG1 UNQ743/PRO1471
Length	223
Function	Co-chaperone for Hsp70 protein HSPA5/BiP that acts as a key repressor of the ERN1/IRE1-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) (By similarity). J domain-containing co-chaperones stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 proteins and are required for efficient substrate recognition by Hsp70 proteins (PubMed:18400946). In the unstressed endoplasmic reticulum, interacts with the luminal region of ERN1/IRE1 and selectively recruits HSPA5/BiP: HSPA5/BiP disrupts the dimerization of the active ERN1/IRE1 luminal region, thereby inactivating ERN1/IRE1 (By similarity). Also involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins. Required for survival of B-cell progenitors and normal antibody production (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum lumen
