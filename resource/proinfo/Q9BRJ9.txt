UniprotID	Q9BRJ9
Accession	Q9BRJ9;Q9NSF1;Q9NSF2
EntryName	MESP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mesoderm posterior protein 1 (Class C basic helix-loop-helix protein 5) (bHLHc5)
GeneName	MESP1 BHLHC5
Length	268
Function	Transcription factor. Plays a role in the epithelialization of somitic mesoderm and in the development of cardiac mesoderm. Defines the rostrocaudal patterning of the somites by participating in distinct Notch pathways (By similarity).
