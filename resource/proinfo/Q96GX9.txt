UniprotID	Q96GX9
Accession	Q96GX9;A8K9D3;Q6PJX6;Q8WVU2;Q96HK2;Q9Y318
EntryName	MTNB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Methylthioribulose-1-phosphate dehydratase (MTRu-1-P dehydratase) (EC 4.2.1.109) (APAF1-interacting protein) (hAPIP)
GeneName	APIP CGI-29
Length	242
Function	Catalyzes the dehydration of methylthioribulose-1-phosphate (MTRu-1-P) into 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate (DK-MTP-1-P). Functions in the methionine salvage pathway, which plays a key role in cancer, apoptosis, microbial proliferation and inflammation. May inhibit the CASP1-related inflammatory response (pyroptosis), the CASP9-dependent apoptotic pathway and the cytochrome c-dependent and APAF1-mediated cell death.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
