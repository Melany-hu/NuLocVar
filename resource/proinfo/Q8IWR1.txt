EntryName	TRI59_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tripartite motif-containing protein 59 (EC 2.3.2.27) (RING finger protein 104) (Tumor suppressor TSBF-1)
GeneName	TRIM59 RNF104 TRIM57 TSBF1
Length	403
Function	E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in different processes such as development and immune response (PubMed:22588174, PubMed:30231667). Serves as a negative regulator for innate immune signaling pathways by suppressing RLR-induced activation of IRF3/7 and NF-kappa-B via interaction with adapter ECSIT (PubMed:22588174). Regulates autophagy through modulating both the transcription and the ubiquitination of BECN1 (PubMed:30231667). On the one hand, regulates the transcription of BECN1 through negatively modulating the NF-kappa-B pathway. On the other hand, regulates TRAF6-mediated 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of BECN1, thus affecting the formation of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex. In addition, mediates 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 and thereby promotes TRAF6 proteasomal degradation (PubMed:30231667). Also acts as a critical regulator for early embryo development from blastocyst stage to gastrula through modulating F-actin assembly and WASH1 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination (By similarity).
