UniprotID	P15259
Accession	P15259
EntryName	PGAM2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (EC 5.4.2.11) (EC 5.4.2.4) (BPG-dependent PGAM 2) (Muscle-specific phosphoglycerate mutase) (Phosphoglycerate mutase isozyme M) (PGAM-M)
GeneName	PGAM2 PGAMM
Length	253
Function	Interconversion of 3- and 2-phosphoglycerate with 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate as the primer of the reaction. Can also catalyze the reaction of EC 5.4.2.4 (synthase), but with a reduced activity.
