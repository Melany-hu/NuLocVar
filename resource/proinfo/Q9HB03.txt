UniprotID	Q9HB03
Accession	Q9HB03;Q5VZL3;Q8N180
EntryName	ELOV3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Very long chain fatty acid elongase 3 (EC 2.3.1.199) (3-keto acyl-CoA synthase ELOVL3) (Cold-inducible glycoprotein of 30 kDa) (ELOVL fatty acid elongase 3) (ELOVL FA elongase 3) (Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 3) (Very long chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 3) (Very long chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA synthase 3)
GeneName	ELOVL3 CIG30
Length	270
Function	Catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction of the four reactions that constitute the long-chain fatty acids elongation cycle. This endoplasmic reticulum-bound enzymatic process allows the addition of 2 carbons to the chain of long- and very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) per cycle. Condensing enzyme that exhibits activity toward saturated and unsaturated acyl-CoA substrates with higher activity toward C18 acyl-CoAs, especially C18:0 acyl-CoAs. May participate in the production of saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs of different chain lengths that are involved in multiple biological processes as precursors of membrane lipids and lipid mediators.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
