UniprotID	Q9P2T1
Accession	Q9P2T1;D3DS66;Q567T0;Q6IAJ8;Q86T14
EntryName	GMPR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	GMP reductase 2 (GMPR 2) (EC 1.7.1.7) (Guanosine 5'-monophosphate oxidoreductase 2) (Guanosine monophosphate reductase 2)
GeneName	GMPR2
Length	348
Function	Catalyzes the irreversible NADPH-dependent deamination of GMP to IMP. It functions in the conversion of nucleobase, nucleoside and nucleotide derivatives of G to A nucleotides, and in maintaining the intracellular balance of A and G nucleotides (PubMed:12009299, PubMed:12669231, PubMed:16359702, PubMed:22037469). Plays a role in modulating cellular differentiation (PubMed:12669231).
