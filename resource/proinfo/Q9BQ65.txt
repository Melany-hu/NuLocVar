UniprotID	Q9BQ65
Accession	Q9BQ65;B4DWE3;B4DZW5;Q96FZ9;Q9H8X8
EntryName	USB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	U6 snRNA phosphodiesterase 1 (hUsb1) (3'-5' RNA exonuclease USB1) (EC 4.6.1.-) (Mutated in poikiloderma with neutropenia protein 1) (Mutated in PN protein 1) (hMpn1)
GeneName	USB1 C16orf57 Mpn1
Length	265
Function	3'-5' RNA exonuclease that trims the 3' end of oligo(U) and oligo(A) tracts of the pre-U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) molecule, leading to the formation of a mature U6 snRNA 3' end-terminated with a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate (PubMed:22899009, PubMed:23022480, PubMed:23190533, PubMed:26213367, PubMed:28887445, PubMed:30215753, PubMed:31832688). Participates in the U6 snRNA 3' end processing that prevents U6 snRNA degradation (PubMed:22899009, PubMed:23022480, PubMed:23190533, PubMed:26213367, PubMed:28887445, PubMed:30215753, PubMed:31832688). In addition also removes uridines from the 3' end of U6atac snRNA and possibly the vault RNA VTRNA1-1 (PubMed:26213367).
