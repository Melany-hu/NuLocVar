UniprotID	Q99808
Accession	Q99808;B3KQV7;B3KQY5;Q5T9W9;Q9UJY2
EntryName	S29A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) (Equilibrative nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside-sensitive nucleoside transporter) (Equilibrative NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transporter) (es nucleoside transporter) (Nucleoside transporter, es-type) (Solute carrier family 29 member 1)
GeneName	SLC29A1 ENT1
Length	456
Function	Uniporter involved in the facilitative transport of nucleosides and nucleobases, and contributes to maintaining their cellular homeostasis (PubMed:10722669, PubMed:10755314, PubMed:12527552, PubMed:14759222, PubMed:15037197, PubMed:17379602, PubMed:21795683, PubMed:26406980, PubMed:27995448, PubMed:35790189, PubMed:8986748). Functions as a Na(+)-independent transporter (PubMed:8986748). Involved in the transport of nucleosides such as adenosine, guanosine, inosine, uridine, thymidine and cytidine (PubMed:10722669, PubMed:10755314, PubMed:12527552, PubMed:14759222, PubMed:15037197, PubMed:17379602, PubMed:26406980, PubMed:8986748). Also transports purine nucleobases (hypoxanthine, adenine, guanine) and pyrimidine nucleobases (thymine, uracil) (PubMed:21795683, PubMed:27995448). Mediates basolateral nucleoside uptake into Sertoli cells, thereby regulating the transport of nucleosides in testis across the blood-testis barrier (By similarity). Regulates inosine levels in brown adipocytes tissues (BAT) and extracellular inosine levels, which controls BAT-dependent energy expenditure (PubMed:35790189).
