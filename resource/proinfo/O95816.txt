UniprotID	O95816
Accession	O95816;B4DXE2;Q08AS9;Q6FID0
EntryName	BAG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 2 (BAG-2) (Bcl-2-associated athanogene 2)
GeneName	BAG2
Length	211
Function	Co-chaperone for HSP70 and HSC70 chaperone proteins. Acts as a nucleotide-exchange factor (NEF) promoting the release of ADP from the HSP70 and HSC70 proteins thereby triggering client/substrate protein release (PubMed:24318877, PubMed:9873016).
