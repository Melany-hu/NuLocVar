UniprotID	P42574
Accession	P42574;A8K5M2;D3DP53;Q96AN1;Q96KP2
EntryName	CASP3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Caspase-3 (CASP-3) (EC 3.4.22.56) (Apopain) (Cysteine protease CPP32) (CPP-32) (Protein Yama) (SREBP cleavage activity 1) (SCA-1) [Cleaved into: Caspase-3 subunit p17; Caspase-3 subunit p12]
GeneName	CASP3 CPP32
Length	277
Function	Thiol protease that acts as a major effector caspase involved in the execution phase of apoptosis (PubMed:18723680, PubMed:20566630, PubMed:23650375, PubMed:35338844, PubMed:35446120, PubMed:7596430). Following cleavage and activation by initiator caspases (CASP8, CASP9 and/or CASP10), mediates execution of apoptosis by catalyzing cleavage of many proteins (PubMed:18723680, PubMed:20566630, PubMed:23650375, PubMed:7596430). At the onset of apoptosis, it proteolytically cleaves poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase PARP1 at a '216-Asp-|-Gly-217' bond (PubMed:10497198, PubMed:16374543, PubMed:7596430, PubMed:7774019). Cleaves and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) between the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain and the membrane attachment domain (By similarity). Cleaves and activates caspase-6, -7 and -9 (CASP6, CASP7 and CASP9, respectively) (PubMed:7596430). Cleaves and inactivates interleukin-18 (IL18) (PubMed:37993714, PubMed:9334240). Involved in the cleavage of huntingtin (PubMed:8696339). Triggers cell adhesion in sympathetic neurons through RET cleavage (PubMed:21357690). Cleaves and inhibits serine/threonine-protein kinase AKT1 in response to oxidative stress (PubMed:23152800). Acts as an inhibitor of type I interferon production during virus-induced apoptosis by mediating cleavage of antiviral proteins CGAS, IRF3 and MAVS, thereby preventing cytokine overproduction (PubMed:30878284). Also involved in pyroptosis by mediating cleavage and activation of gasdermin-E (GSDME) (PubMed:35338844, PubMed:35446120). Cleaves XRCC4 and phospholipid scramblase proteins XKR4, XKR8 and XKR9, leading to promote phosphatidylserine exposure on apoptotic cell surface (PubMed:23845944, PubMed:33725486). Cleaves BIRC6 following inhibition of BIRC6-caspase binding by DIABLO/SMAC (PubMed:36758104, PubMed:36758106).
