UniprotID	P03956
Accession	P03956;P08156
EntryName	MMP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Interstitial collagenase (EC 3.4.24.7) (Fibroblast collagenase) (Matrix metalloproteinase-1) (MMP-1) [Cleaved into: 22 kDa interstitial collagenase; 27 kDa interstitial collagenase]
GeneName	MMP1 CLG
Length	469
Function	Cleaves collagens of types I, II, and III at one site in the helical domain. Also cleaves collagens of types VII and X (PubMed:1645757, PubMed:2153297, PubMed:2557822). In case of HIV infection, interacts and cleaves the secreted viral Tat protein, leading to a decrease in neuronal Tat's mediated neurotoxicity (PubMed:16807369).
