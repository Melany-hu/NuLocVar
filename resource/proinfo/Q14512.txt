UniprotID	Q14512
Accession	Q14512;A8K5J2
EntryName	FGFP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibroblast growth factor-binding protein 1 (FGF-BP) (FGF-BP1) (FGF-binding protein 1) (FGFBP-1) (17 kDa heparin-binding growth factor-binding protein) (17 kDa HBGF-binding protein) (HBp17)
GeneName	FGFBP1 FGFBP HBP17
Length	234
Function	Acts as a carrier protein that release fibroblast-binding factors (FGFs) from the extracellular matrix (EM) storage and thus enhance the mitogenic activity of FGFs. Enhances FGF2 signaling during tissue repair, angiogenesis and in tumor growth.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Extracellular space; Cell membrane
