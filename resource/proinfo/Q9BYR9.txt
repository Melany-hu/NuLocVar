UniprotID	Q9BYR9
Accession	Q9BYR9;Q495J2
EntryName	KRA24_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 2-4 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 2.4) (Keratin-associated protein 2.4)
GeneName	KRTAP2-4 KAP2.4 KRTAP2.4
Length	128
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins (By similarity).
