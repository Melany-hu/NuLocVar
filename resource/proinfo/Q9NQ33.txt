UniprotID	Q9NQ33
Accession	Q9NQ33;Q8WYQ6
EntryName	ASCL3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Achaete-scute homolog 3 (ASH-3) (hASH3) (Class A basic helix-loop-helix protein 42) (bHLHa42) (bHLH transcriptional regulator Sgn-1)
GeneName	ASCL3 BHLHA42 HASH3 SGN1
Length	181
Function	Transcriptional repressor. Inhibits myogenesis. Plays a role in progenitor cells which differentiate into ductal and acinar, but not myoepithelial, cell lineages in the salivary glands. Involved in the functions of the microvillar cells and Bowman's glands and probably, in a non-cell-autonomous manner, in the development or regeneration of a complete olfactory epithelium (OE).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
