UniprotID	Q7Z5W3
Accession	Q7Z5W3;A8K829
EntryName	BN3D2_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA 5'-monophosphate methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.-) (BCDIN3 domain-containing protein)
GeneName	BCDIN3D
Length	292
Function	O-methyltransferase that specifically monomethylates 5'-monophosphate of cytoplasmic histidyl tRNA (tRNA(His)), acting as a capping enzyme by protecting tRNA(His) from cleavage by DICER1 (PubMed:28119416, PubMed:31329584, PubMed:31919512). Also able, with less efficiently, to methylate the 5' monophosphate of a subset of pre-miRNAs, acting as a negative regulator of miRNA processing (PubMed:23063121, PubMed:28119416). The 5' monophosphate of pre-miRNAs is recognized by DICER1 and is required for pre-miRNAs processing: methylation at this position reduces the processing of pre-miRNAs by DICER1 (PubMed:23063121). Was also reported to mediate dimethylation of pre-miR-145; however dimethylation cannot be reproduced by another group which observes a monomethylation of pre-miR-145 (PubMed:23063121, PubMed:28119416).
