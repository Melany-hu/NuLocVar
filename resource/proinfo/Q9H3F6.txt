UniprotID	Q9H3F6
Accession	Q9H3F6;Q53HN2;Q59FV1;Q6PL47;Q96SU0
EntryName	BACD3_HUMAN
ProteinName	BTB/POZ domain-containing adapter for CUL3-mediated RhoA degradation protein 3 (hBACURD3) (BTB/POZ domain-containing protein KCTD10) (Potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 10)
GeneName	KCTD10 ULR061 MSTP028
Length	313
Function	Substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex. The BCR(BACURD3) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex mediates the ubiquitination of target proteins, leading to their degradation by the proteasome (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
