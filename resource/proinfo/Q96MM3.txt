UniprotID	Q96MM3
Accession	Q96MM3;D3DP65;Q8WXE2
EntryName	ZFP42_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein 42 homolog (Zfp-42) (Reduced expression protein 1) (REX-1) (hREX-1) (Zinc finger protein 754)
GeneName	ZFP42 REX1 ZNF754
Length	310
Function	Involved in the reprogramming of X-chromosome inactivation during the acquisition of pluripotency. Required for efficient elongation of TSIX, a non-coding RNA antisense to XIST. Binds DXPas34 enhancer within the TSIX promoter. Involved in ES cell self-renewal (By similarity).
