EntryName	GPR31_HUMAN
ProteinName	12-(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid receptor (12-(S)-HETE receptor) (12-HETER) (G-protein coupled receptor 31) (GPR31/12-HETER)
GeneName	GPR31
Length	319
Function	High-affinity receptor for 12-(S)-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-S-HETE), with much lower affinities for other HETE isomers (PubMed:21712392, PubMed:29227475). 12-S-HETE is a eicosanoid, a 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) metabolite of arachidonic acid, involved in many physiologic and pathologic processes (PubMed:26965684, PubMed:28619714, PubMed:29227475). 12-S-HETE-binding leads to activation of ERK1/2 (MAPK3/MAPK1), MEK, and NF-kappa-B pathways leading to cell growth (PubMed:21712392, PubMed:29227475). Plays a crucial role for proliferation, survival and macropinocytosis of KRAS-dependent cancer cells by mediating the translocation of KRAS from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane (PM) and its association with the PM (PubMed:28619714). Contributes to enhanced immune responses by inducing dendrite protrusion of small intestinal CX3CR1(+) phagocytes for the uptake of luminal antigens (By similarity). Acts also as a key receptor for 12-(S)-HETE-mediated liver ischemia reperfusion injury (PubMed:29227475).
