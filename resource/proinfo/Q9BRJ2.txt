EntryName	RM45_HUMAN
ProteinName	Large ribosomal subunit protein mL45 (39S ribosomal protein L45, mitochondrial) (L45mt) (MRP-L45)
GeneName	MRPL45
Length	306
Function	Component of the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mt-LSU) (PubMed:25278503, PubMed:25838379, PubMed:28892042, PubMed:33602856, PubMed:35177605). Within the mitochondrial ribosomes, required to direct the nascent polypeptide toward the tunnel exit and position the exit at a distance from the membrane surface (PubMed:33602856).
