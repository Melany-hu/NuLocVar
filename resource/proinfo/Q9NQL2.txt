EntryName	RRAGD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ras-related GTP-binding protein D (Rag D) (RagD) (EC 3.6.5.-)
GeneName	RRAGD
Length	400
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein that plays a crucial role in the cellular response to amino acid availability through regulation of the mTORC1 signaling cascade (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279, PubMed:34607910). Forms heterodimeric Rag complexes with RagA/RRAGA or RagB/RRAGB and cycles between an inactive GTP-bound and an active GDP-bound form: RagD/RRAGD is in its active form when GDP-bound RagD/RRAGD forms a complex with GTP-bound RagA/RRAGA (or RagB/RRAGB) and in an inactive form when GTP-bound RagD/RRAGD heterodimerizes with GDP-bound RagA/RRAGA (or RagB/RRAGB) (PubMed:24095279). In its active form, promotes the recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomes and its subsequent activation by the GTPase RHEB (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279). This is a crucial step in the activation of the MTOR signaling cascade by amino acids (PubMed:20381137, PubMed:24095279). Also plays a central role in the non-canonical mTORC1 complex, which acts independently of RHEB and specifically mediates phosphorylation of MiT/TFE factors TFEB and TFE3: GDP-bound RagD/RRAGD mediates recruitment of MiT/TFE factors TFEB and TFE3 (PubMed:32612235).
