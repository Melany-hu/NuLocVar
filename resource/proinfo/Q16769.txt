UniprotID	Q16769
Accession	Q16769;Q16770;Q3KRG6;Q53TR4
EntryName	QPCT_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase (EC 2.3.2.5) (Glutaminyl cyclase) (QC) (sQC) (Glutaminyl-tRNA cyclotransferase) (Glutamyl cyclase) (EC)
GeneName	QPCT
Length	361
Function	Responsible for the biosynthesis of pyroglutamyl peptides. Has a bias against acidic and tryptophan residues adjacent to the N-terminal glutaminyl residue and a lack of importance of chain length after the second residue. Also catalyzes N-terminal pyroglutamate formation. In vitro, catalyzes pyroglutamate formation of N-terminally truncated form of APP amyloid-beta peptides -amyloid-beta. May be involved in the N-terminal pyroglutamate formation of several amyloid-related plaque-forming peptides.
