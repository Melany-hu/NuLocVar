UniprotID	Q14183
Accession	Q14183;B4DEJ2;H3BNH6;Q6P4G4;Q7Z5G0;Q8IVX0
EntryName	DOC2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Double C2-like domain-containing protein alpha (Doc2) (Doc2-alpha)
GeneName	DOC2A
Length	400
Function	Calcium sensor which most probably regulates fusion of vesicles with membranes. Binds calcium and phospholipids. May be involved in calcium dependent neurotransmitter release through the interaction with UNC13A. May be involved in calcium-dependent spontaneous release of neurotransmitter in absence of action potentials in neuronal cells. Regulates Ca(2+)-dependent secretory lysosome exocytosis in mast cells.
Subcellular Location	Lysosome; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Secretory vesicle; Synaptic vesicle membrane; Synapse; Synaptosome
