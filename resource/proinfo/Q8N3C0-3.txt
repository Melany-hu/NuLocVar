UniprotID	Q8N3C0-3
Accession	Q8N3C0;E7EW23;O43738;Q4G1A0;Q5VTN2;Q9H1I9;Q9H5A2;Q9NTR0
EntryName	ASCC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Activating signal cointegrator 1 complex subunit 3 (EC 3.6.4.12) (ASC-1 complex subunit p200) (ASC1p200) (Helicase, ATP binding 1) (Trip4 complex subunit p200)
GeneName	ASCC3 HELIC1 RQT2
Length	111
Function	ATPase involved both in DNA repair and rescue of stalled ribosomes (PubMed:22055184, PubMed:28757607, PubMed:32099016, PubMed:32579943, PubMed:36302773). 3'-5' DNA helicase involved in repair of alkylated DNA: promotes DNA unwinding to generate single-stranded substrate needed for ALKBH3, enabling ALKBH3 to process alkylated N3-methylcytosine (3mC) within double-stranded regions (PubMed:22055184). Also involved in activation of the ribosome quality control (RQC) pathway, a pathway that degrades nascent peptide chains during problematic translation (PubMed:28757607, PubMed:32099016, PubMed:32579943, PubMed:36302773). Drives the splitting of stalled ribosomes that are ubiquitinated in a ZNF598-dependent manner, as part of the ribosome quality control trigger (RQT) complex (PubMed:28757607, PubMed:32099016, PubMed:32579943, PubMed:36302773). Part of the ASC-1 complex that enhances NF-kappa-B, SRF and AP1 transactivation (PubMed:12077347).
