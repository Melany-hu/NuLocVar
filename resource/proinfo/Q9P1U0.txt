UniprotID	Q9P1U0
Accession	Q9P1U0
EntryName	RPA12_HUMAN
ProteinName	DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit RPA12 (DNA-directed RNA polymerase I subunit H) (Zinc ribbon domain-containing protein 1)
GeneName	POLR1H RPA12 ZNRD1
Length	126
Function	Core component of RNA polymerase I (Pol I), a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase which synthesizes ribosomal RNA precursors using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Can mediate Pol I proofreading of the nascent RNA transcript. Anchors into the Pol I active site to monitor transcription fidelity and cleave mis-incorporated 5'-ribonucleotides.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Nucleolus
