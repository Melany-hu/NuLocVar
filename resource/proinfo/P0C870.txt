EntryName	JMJD7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bifunctional peptidase and (3S)-lysyl hydroxylase JMJD7 (EC 1.14.11.63) (EC 3.4.-.-) (JmjC domain-containing protein 7) (Jumonji domain-containing protein 7) (L-lysine (3S)-hydroxylase JMJD7)
GeneName	JMJD7
Length	316
Function	Bifunctional enzyme that acts both as an endopeptidase and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent monooxygenase (PubMed:28847961, PubMed:29915238). Endopeptidase that cleaves histones N-terminal tails at the carboxyl side of methylated arginine or lysine residues, to generate 'tailless nucleosomes', which may trigger transcription elongation (PubMed:28847961). Preferentially recognizes and cleaves monomethylated and dimethylated arginine residues of histones H2, H3 and H4 (PubMed:28847961). After initial cleavage, continues to digest histones tails via its aminopeptidase activity (PubMed:28847961). Additionally, may play a role in protein biosynthesis by modifying the translation machinery (PubMed:29915238). Acts as a Fe(2+) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent monooxygenase, catalyzing (S)-stereospecific hydroxylation at C-3 of 'Lys-22' of DRG1 and 'Lys-21' of DRG2 translation factors (TRAFAC), promoting their interaction with ribonucleic acids (RNA) (PubMed:29915238).
