EntryName	NU2M_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 2 (EC 7.1.1.2) (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2)
GeneName	MT-ND2 MTND2 NADH2 ND2
Length	347
Function	Core subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) which catalyzes electron transfer from NADH through the respiratory chain, using ubiquinone as an electron acceptor (PubMed:16996290). Essential for the catalytic activity and assembly of complex I (PubMed:16996290).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
