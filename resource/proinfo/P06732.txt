UniprotID	P06732
Accession	P06732;Q96QL9
EntryName	KCRM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Creatine kinase M-type (EC 2.7.3.2) (Creatine kinase M chain) (Creatine phosphokinase M-type) (CPK-M) (M-CK)
GeneName	CKM CKMM
Length	381
Function	Reversibly catalyzes the transfer of phosphate between ATP and various phosphogens (e.g. creatine phosphate). Creatine kinase isoenzymes play a central role in energy transduction in tissues with large, fluctuating energy demands, such as skeletal muscle, heart, brain and spermatozoa.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
