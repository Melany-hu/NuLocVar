EntryName	CRFR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 2 (CRF-R-2) (CRF-R2) (CRFR-2) (Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2) (CRH-R-2) (CRH-R2)
GeneName	CRHR2 CRF2R CRH2R
Length	411
Function	G-protein coupled receptor for CRH (corticotropin-releasing factor), UCN (urocortin), UCN2 and UCN3. Has high affinity for UCN. Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and down-stream effectors, such as adenylate cyclase. Promotes the activation of adenylate cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
