Function	Component of the MRN complex, which plays a central role in double-strand break (DSB) repair, DNA recombination, maintenance of telomere integrity and meiosis. The MRN complex is involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via homologous recombination (HR), an error-free mechanism which primarily occurs during S and G2 phases. The complex (1) mediates the end resection of damaged DNA, which generates proper single-stranded DNA, a key initial steps in HR, and is (2) required for the recruitment of other repair factors and efficient activation of ATM and ATR upon DNA damage. The MRN complex possesses single-strand endonuclease activity and double-strand-specific 3'-5' exonuclease activity, which are provided by MRE11, to initiate end resection, which is required for single-strand invasion and recombination. Within the MRN complex, nbn acts as a protein-protein adapter, which specifically recognizes and binds phosphorylated proteins, promoting their recruitment to DNA damage sites. Recruits mre11 and rad50 components of the MRN complex to DSBs in response to DNA damage. Promotes the recruitment of PI3/PI4-kinase family members atm, atr, and probably DNA-PKcs to the DNA damage sites, activating their functions. Mediates the recruitment of phosphorylated rbbp8/CtIP to DSBs, leading to cooperation between the MRN complex and rbbp8/CtIP to initiate end resection.
