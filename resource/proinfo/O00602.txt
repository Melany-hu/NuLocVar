UniprotID	O00602
Accession	O00602;Q5VYV5;Q92596
EntryName	FCN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ficolin-1 (Collagen/fibrinogen domain-containing protein 1) (Ficolin-A) (Ficolin-alpha) (M-ficolin)
GeneName	FCN1 FCNM
Length	326
Function	Extracellular lectin functioning as a pattern-recognition receptor in innate immunity. Binds the sugar moieties of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) displayed on microbes and activates the lectin pathway of the complement system. May also activate monocytes through a G protein-coupled receptor, FFAR2, inducing the secretion of interleukin-8/IL-8 (PubMed:21037097). Binds preferentially to 9-O-acetylated 2-6-linked sialic acid derivatives and to various glycans containing sialic acid engaged in a 2-3 linkage.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Cell membrane
