UniprotID	P00491
Accession	P00491;B2R8S5;D3DS00;Q15160;Q5PZ03
EntryName	PNPH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) (EC 2.4.2.1) (Inosine phosphorylase) (Inosine-guanosine phosphorylase)
GeneName	PNP NP
Length	289
Function	Catalyzes the phosphorolytic breakdown of the N-glycosidic bond in the beta-(deoxy)ribonucleoside molecules, with the formation of the corresponding free purine bases and pentose-1-phosphate (PubMed:23438750, PubMed:9305964). Preferentially acts on 6-oxopurine nucleosides including inosine and guanosine (PubMed:9305964).
