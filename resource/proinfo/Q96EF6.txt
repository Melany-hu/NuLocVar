UniprotID	Q96EF6
Accession	Q96EF6;Q96LQ4
EntryName	FBX17_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-box only protein 17 (F-box only protein 26)
GeneName	FBXO17 FBG4 FBX17 FBX26 FBXO26
Length	278
Function	Substrate-recognition component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Able to recognize and bind denatured glycoproteins, which are modified with complex-type oligosaccharides. Also recognizes sulfated glycans. Does not bind high-mannose glycoproteins.
