EntryName	TRI10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tripartite motif-containing protein 10 (B30-RING finger protein) (RING finger protein 9)
GeneName	TRIM10 RFB30 RNF9
Length	481
Function	E3 ligase that plays an essential role in the differentiation and survival of terminal erythroid cells. May directly bind to PTEN and promote its ubiquitination, resulting in its proteasomal degradation and activation of hypertrophic signaling (By similarity). In addition, plays a role in immune response regulation by repressing the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 in the interferon/JAK/STAT signaling pathway independent of its E3 ligase activity. Mechanistically, interacts with the intracellular domain of IFNAR1 and thereby inhibits the association between TYK2 and IFNAR1 (PubMed:33811647).
