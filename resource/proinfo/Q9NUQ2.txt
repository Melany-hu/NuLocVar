UniprotID	Q9NUQ2
Accession	Q9NUQ2;Q8IZ47;Q9BQG4
EntryName	PLCE_HUMAN
ProteinName	1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase epsilon (EC 2.3.1.51) (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 5) (1-AGP acyltransferase 5) (1-AGPAT 5) (Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase epsilon) (LPAAT-epsilon)
GeneName	AGPAT5
Length	364
Function	Converts 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (lysophosphatidic acid or LPA) into 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (phosphatidic acid or PA) by incorporating an acyl moiety at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone (PubMed:21173190). Acts on LPA containing saturated or unsaturated fatty acids C15:0-C20:4 at the sn-1 position using C18:1-CoA as the acyl donor (PubMed:21173190). Also acts on lysophosphatidylethanolamine using oleoyl-CoA, but not arachidonoyl-CoA, and lysophosphatidylinositol using arachidonoyl-CoA, but not oleoyl-CoA (PubMed:21173190). Activity toward lysophosphatidylglycerol not detectable (PubMed:21173190).
