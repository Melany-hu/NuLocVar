EntryName	KCC2A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II subunit alpha (CaM kinase II subunit alpha) (CaMK-II subunit alpha) (EC 2.7.11.17)
GeneName	CAMK2A CAMKA KIAA0968
Length	478
Function	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase that functions autonomously after Ca(2+)/calmodulin-binding and autophosphorylation, and is involved in various processes, such as synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter release and long-term potentiation (PubMed:14722083). Member of the NMDAR signaling complex in excitatory synapses, it regulates NMDAR-dependent potentiation of the AMPAR and therefore excitatory synaptic transmission (By similarity). Regulates dendritic spine development (PubMed:28130356). Also regulates the migration of developing neurons (PubMed:29100089). Phosphorylates the transcription factor FOXO3 to activate its transcriptional activity (PubMed:23805378). Phosphorylates the transcription factor ETS1 in response to calcium signaling, thereby decreasing ETS1 affinity for DNA (By similarity). In response to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) stimulation, catalyzes phosphorylation of STAT1, stimulating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (PubMed:11972023). In response to interferon-beta (IFN-beta) stimulation, stimulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (PubMed:35568036). Acts as a negative regulator of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)-mediated synaptic signaling via modulation of DAGLA activity (By similarity).
