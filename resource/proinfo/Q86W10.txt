UniprotID	Q86W10
Accession	Q86W10;Q5VVE4
EntryName	CP4Z1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 4Z1 (EC 1.14.14.1) (CYPIVZ1) (Laurate 7-monooxygenase) (EC 1.14.14.130)
GeneName	CYP4Z1 UNQ3060/PRO9882
Length	505
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that catalyzes the in-chain oxidation of fatty acids (PubMed:19090726, PubMed:29018033). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Hydroxylates lauric and myristic acids predominantly at the omega-4 and omega-2 positions, respectively (PubMed:19090726, PubMed:29018033). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Displays an absolute stereoselectivity in the epoxidation of arachidonic acid producing the 14(S),15(R)-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) enantiomer (PubMed:29018033). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR; NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:19090726, PubMed:29018033).
