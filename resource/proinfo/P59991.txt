UniprotID	P59991
Accession	P59991;A6NIS1;A6NMS9;Q0VAS4
EntryName	KR122_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 12-2 (High sulfur keratin-associated protein 12.2) (Keratin-associated protein 12.2)
GeneName	KRTAP12-2 KAP12.2 KRTAP12.2
Length	146
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
