UniprotID	P56704
Accession	P56704;Q3SY79;Q3SY80;Q969P2
EntryName	WNT3A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein Wnt-3a
GeneName	WNT3A
Length	352
Function	Ligand for members of the frizzled family of seven transmembrane receptors (Probable). Functions in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway that results in activation of transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family (PubMed:20093360, PubMed:21244856, PubMed:24841207, PubMed:26902720). Required for normal embryonic mesoderm development and formation of caudal somites. Required for normal morphogenesis of the developing neural tube (By similarity). Mediates self-renewal of the stem cells at the bottom on intestinal crypts (in vitro) (PubMed:26902720).
