Accession	Q7Z4G4;E1P570;Q5JY11;Q6PGQ5;Q9HC13
EntryName	TRM11_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA (guanine(10)-N(2))-methyltransferase TRMT11 (EC 2.1.1.214) (tRNA methyltransferase 11 homolog)
GeneName	TRMT11 C6orf75 MDS024
Length	463
Function	Catalytic subunit of the TRMT11-TRM112 methyltransferase complex, that specifically mediates the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent N(2)-methylation of guanosine nucleotide at position 10 (m2G10) in tRNAs (PubMed:37283053). This is one of the major tRNA (guanine-N(2))-methyltransferases (PubMed:37283053).
