UniprotID	P19099
Accession	P19099;B0ZBE4;Q16726
EntryName	C11B2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytochrome P450 11B2, mitochondrial (Aldosterone synthase) (ALDOS) (Aldosterone-synthesizing enzyme) (CYPXIB2) (Corticosterone 18-monooxygenase, CYP11B2) (EC 1.14.15.5) (Cytochrome P-450Aldo) (Cytochrome P-450C18) (Steroid 11-beta-hydroxylase, CYP11B2) (EC 1.14.15.4) (Steroid 18-hydroxylase)
GeneName	CYP11B2
Length	503
Function	A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that catalyzes the biosynthesis of aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid in the human body responsible for salt and water homeostasis, thus involved in blood pressure regulation, arterial hypertension, and the development of heart failure (PubMed:11856349, PubMed:12530636, PubMed:1518866, PubMed:15356073, PubMed:1594605, PubMed:1775135, PubMed:22446688, PubMed:23322723, PubMed:9814482, PubMed:9814506). Catalyzes three sequential oxidative reactions of 11-deoxycorticosterone (21-hydroxyprogesterone), namely 11-beta hydroxylation, followed by two successive oxidations at C18 yielding 18-hydroxy and then 18-oxo intermediates (that would not leave the enzyme active site during the consecutive hydroxylation reactions), ending with the formation of aldosterone (PubMed:11856349, PubMed:12530636, PubMed:1518866, PubMed:1594605, PubMed:1775135, PubMed:22446688, PubMed:23322723, PubMed:9814506). Can also produce 18-hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol, derived from successive oxidations of cortisol at C18, normally found at very low levels, but significantly increased in primary aldosteronism, the most common form of secondary hypertension (PubMed:15356073, PubMed:9814482). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate and reducing the second into a water molecule. Two electrons are provided by NADPH via a two-protein mitochondrial transfer system comprising flavoprotein FDXR (adrenodoxin/ferredoxin reductase) and nonheme iron-sulfur protein FDX1 or FDX2 (adrenodoxin/ferredoxin) (PubMed:11856349, PubMed:1594605, PubMed:23322723, PubMed:9814506). Could also be involved in the androgen metabolic pathway (Probable).
