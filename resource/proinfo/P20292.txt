UniprotID	P20292
Accession	P20292;Q5VV04
EntryName	AL5AP_HUMAN
ProteinName	Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) (MK-886-binding protein)
GeneName	ALOX5AP FLAP
Length	161
Function	Required for leukotriene biosynthesis by ALOX5 (5-lipoxygenase). Anchors ALOX5 to the membrane. Binds arachidonic acid, and could play an essential role in the transfer of arachidonic acid to ALOX5. Binds to MK-886, a compound that blocks the biosynthesis of leukotrienes.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
