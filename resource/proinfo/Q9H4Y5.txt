UniprotID	Q9H4Y5
Accession	Q9H4Y5;A8K771;B4DJW6;E7ESD6;Q49TW5;Q5GM70;Q5JU15;Q86WP3
EntryName	GSTO2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glutathione S-transferase omega-2 (GSTO-2) (EC 2.5.1.18) (Glutathione S-transferase omega 2-2) (GSTO 2-2) (Glutathione-dependent dehydroascorbate reductase) (EC 1.8.5.1) (Monomethylarsonic acid reductase) (MMA(V) reductase) (EC 1.20.4.2)
GeneName	GSTO2
Length	243
Function	Exhibits glutathione-dependent thiol transferase activity. Has high dehydroascorbate reductase activity and may contribute to the recycling of ascorbic acid. Participates in the biotransformation of inorganic arsenic and reduces monomethylarsonic acid (MMA).
