UniprotID	A0A7I2V2Z2
Accession	A0A7I2V2Z2
EntryName	A0A7I2V2Z2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dynactin subunit 2
GeneName	DCTN2
Length	107
Function	Part of the dynactin complex that activates the molecular motor dynein for ultra-processive transport along microtubules. In the dynactin soulder domain, binds the ACTR1A filament and acts as a molecular ruler to determine the length. Modulates cytoplasmic dynein binding to an organelle, and plays a role in prometaphase chromosome alignment and spindle organization during mitosis. Involved in anchoring microtubules to centrosomes. May play a role in synapse formation during brain development.
