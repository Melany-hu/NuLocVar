UniprotID	P00568
Accession	P00568;Q9BVK9;Q9UQC7
EntryName	KAD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Adenylate kinase isoenzyme 1 (AK 1) (EC 2.7.4.3) (EC 2.7.4.4) (EC 2.7.4.6) (ATP-AMP transphosphorylase 1) (ATP:AMP phosphotransferase) (Adenylate monophosphate kinase) (Myokinase)
GeneName	AK1
Length	194
Function	Catalyzes the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphate group between ATP and AMP. Also displays broad nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity. Plays an important role in cellular energy homeostasis and in adenine nucleotide metabolism (By similarity) (PubMed:21080915, PubMed:23416111, PubMed:2542324). Also catalyzes at a very low rate the synthesis of thiamine triphosphate (ThTP) from thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) and ADP (By similarity).
