EntryName	BECN1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beclin-1 (Coiled-coil myosin-like BCL2-interacting protein) (Protein GT197) [Cleaved into: Beclin-1-C 35 kDa; Beclin-1-C 37 kDa]
GeneName	BECN1 GT197
Length	450
Function	Plays a central role in autophagy (PubMed:18570871, PubMed:21358617, PubMed:23184933, PubMed:23974797, PubMed:25484083, PubMed:28445460, PubMed:37776275). Acts as a core subunit of the PI3K complex that mediates formation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; different complex forms are believed to play a role in multiple membrane trafficking pathways: PI3KC3-C1 is involved in initiation of autophagosomes and PI3KC3-C2 in maturation of autophagosomes and endocytosis. Involved in regulation of degradative endocytic trafficking and required for the abscission step in cytokinesis, probably in the context of PI3KC3-C2 (PubMed:20208530, PubMed:20643123, PubMed:23974797, PubMed:26783301). Essential for the formation of PI3KC3-C2 but not PI3KC3-C1 PI3K complex forms. Involved in endocytosis (PubMed:25275521). May play a role in antiviral host defense.
