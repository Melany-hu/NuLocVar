UniprotID	P35247
Accession	P35247;Q5T0M3;Q6FH08;Q86YK9;Q8TCD8;Q9UCJ2;Q9UCJ3
EntryName	SFTPD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Pulmonary surfactant-associated protein D (PSP-D) (SP-D) (Collectin-7) (Lung surfactant protein D)
GeneName	SFTPD COLEC7 PSPD SFTP4
Length	375
Function	Contributes to the lung's defense against inhaled microorganisms, organic antigens and toxins. Interacts with compounds such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides, oligosaccharides and fatty acids and modulates leukocyte action in immune response. May participate in the extracellular reorganization or turnover of pulmonary surfactant. Binds strongly maltose residues and to a lesser extent other alpha-glucosyl moieties.
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Extracellular space; Extracellular matrix; Secreted; Extracellular space; Surface film
