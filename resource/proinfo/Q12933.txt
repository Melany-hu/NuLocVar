UniprotID	Q12933
Accession	Q12933;A8K107;B4DPJ7;Q7Z337;Q96NT2
EntryName	TRAF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (EC 2.3.2.27) (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase TRAF2) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase TRAF2) (Tumor necrosis factor type 2 receptor-associated protein 3)
GeneName	TRAF2 TRAP3
Length	501
Function	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates activation of NF-kappa-B and JNK and plays a central role in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis (PubMed:10346818, PubMed:11784851, PubMed:12917689, PubMed:15383523, PubMed:18981220, PubMed:19150425, PubMed:19810754, PubMed:19918265, PubMed:19937093, PubMed:20047764, PubMed:20064526, PubMed:20385093, PubMed:20577214, PubMed:22212761). Catalyzes 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of target proteins, such as BIRC3, IKBKE, MLST8, RIPK1 and TICAM1 (PubMed:23453969, PubMed:28489822). Is an essential constituent of several E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes, where it promotes the ubiquitination of target proteins by bringing them into contact with other E3 ubiquitin ligases (PubMed:15383523, PubMed:18981220). Regulates BIRC2 and BIRC3 protein levels by inhibiting their autoubiquitination and subsequent degradation; this does not depend on the TRAF2 RING-type zinc finger domain (PubMed:11907583, PubMed:19506082). Plays a role in mediating activation of NF-kappa-B by EIF2AK2/PKR (PubMed:15121867). In complex with BIRC2 or BIRC3, promotes ubiquitination of IKBKE (PubMed:23453969). Acts as a regulator of mTORC1 and mTORC2 assembly by mediating 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of MLST8, thereby inhibiting formation of the mTORC2 complex, while facilitating assembly of the mTORC1 complex (PubMed:28489822). Required for normal antibody isotype switching from IgM to IgG (By similarity).
