UniprotID	P35575
Accession	P35575;A1L4C0;B4E1C3;K7EL82
EntryName	G6PC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit 1 (EC 3.1.3.9) (Glucose-6-phosphatase) (G-6-Pase) (G6Pase) (Glucose-6-phosphatase alpha) (G6Pase-alpha)
GeneName	G6PC1 G6PC G6PT
Length	357
Function	Hydrolyzes glucose-6-phosphate to glucose in the endoplasmic reticulum. Forms with the glucose-6-phosphate transporter (SLC37A4/G6PT) the complex responsible for glucose production in the terminal step of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Hence, it is the key enzyme in homeostatic regulation of blood glucose levels.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
