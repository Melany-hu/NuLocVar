UniprotID	Q9H6D8
Accession	Q9H6D8;D6W560
EntryName	FNDC4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 4 (Fibronectin type III repeat-containing protein 1) [Cleaved into: Soluble FNDC4 (sFNDC4)]
GeneName	FNDC4 FRCP1 UNQ6389/PRO21134
Length	234
Function	Has anti-inflammatory properties. In the colon, acts on macrophages to down-regulate inflammation. May suppress osteoclastogenesis and mature osteoclast resorptive function. In white adipose tissue, decreases local inflammation, via interaction with GPR116. Also required for proper systemic glucose tolerance, specifically sensitizing white adipocytes to insulin and promoting glucose uptake. The insulin sensitizing function in adipose tissue is mediated by interaction with ADGRF5/GPR116 and activation of cAMP signaling.
