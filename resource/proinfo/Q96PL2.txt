Length	329
Function	One of the major non-collagenous components of the tectorial membrane (By similarity). The tectorial membrane is an extracellular matrix of the inner ear that covers the neuroepithelium of the cochlea and contacts the stereocilia bundles of specialized sensory hair cells. Sound induces movement of these hair cells relative to the tectorial membrane, deflects the stereocilia and leads to fluctuations in hair-cell membrane potential, transducing sound into electrical signals.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Secreted; Extracellular space; Extracellular matrix
