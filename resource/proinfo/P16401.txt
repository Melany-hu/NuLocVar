UniprotID	P16401
Accession	P16401;Q14529;Q3MJ42
EntryName	H15_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H1.5 (Histone H1a) (Histone H1b) (Histone H1s-3)
GeneName	H1-5 H1F5 HIST1H1B
Length	226
Function	Histone H1 protein binds to linker DNA between nucleosomes forming the macromolecular structure known as the chromatin fiber. Histones H1 are necessary for the condensation of nucleosome chains into higher-order structured fibers. Also acts as a regulator of individual gene transcription through chromatin remodeling, nucleosome spacing and DNA methylation (By similarity).
