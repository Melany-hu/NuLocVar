EntryName	CEBPE_HUMAN
ProteinName	CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein epsilon (C/EBP epsilon)
GeneName	CEBPE
Length	281
Function	Transcriptional activator (PubMed:26019275). C/EBP are DNA-binding proteins that recognize two different motifs: the CCAAT homology common to many promoters and the enhanced core homology common to many enhancers. Required for the promyelocyte-myelocyte transition in myeloid differentiation (PubMed:10359588).
