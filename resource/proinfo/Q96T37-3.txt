EntryName	RBM15_HUMAN
ProteinName	RNA-binding protein 15 (One-twenty two protein 1) (RNA-binding motif protein 15)
GeneName	RBM15 OTT OTT1
Length	969
Function	RNA-binding protein that acts as a key regulator of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation of RNAs, thereby regulating different processes, such as hematopoietic cell homeostasis, alternative splicing of mRNAs and X chromosome inactivation mediated by Xist RNA (PubMed:27602518). Associated component of the WMM complex, a complex that mediates N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation of RNAs, a modification that plays a role in the efficiency of mRNA splicing and RNA processing (By similarity). Plays a key role in m6A methylation, possibly by binding target RNAs and recruiting the WMM complex (PubMed:27602518). Involved in random X inactivation mediated by Xist RNA: acts by binding Xist RNA and recruiting the WMM complex, which mediates m6A methylation, leading to target YTHDC1 reader on Xist RNA and promoting transcription repression activity of Xist (PubMed:27602518). Required for the development of multiple tissues, such as the maintenance of the homeostasis of long-term hematopoietic stem cells and for megakaryocyte (MK) and B-cell differentiation (By similarity). Regulates megakaryocyte differentiation by regulating alternative splicing of genes important for megakaryocyte differentiation; probably regulates alternative splicing via m6A regulation (PubMed:26575292). Required for placental vascular branching morphogenesis and embryonic development of the heart and spleen (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of thrombopoietin response in hematopoietic stem cells by regulating alternative splicing of MPL (By similarity). May also function as an mRNA export factor, stimulating export and expression of RTE-containing mRNAs which are present in many retrotransposons that require to be exported prior to splicing (PubMed:17001072, PubMed:19786495). High affinity binding of pre-mRNA to RBM15 may allow targeting of the mRNP to the export helicase DBP5 in a manner that is independent of splicing-mediated NXF1 deposition, resulting in export prior to splicing (PubMed:17001072, PubMed:19786495). May be implicated in HOX gene regulation (PubMed:11344311).
