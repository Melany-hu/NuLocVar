UniprotID	Q9NQW5
Accession	Q9NQW5;A4Q9G8;Q08EM4;Q9NQW4
EntryName	PRDM7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase PRDM7 (EC 2.1.1.-) (PR domain zinc finger protein 7) (PR domain-containing protein 7) ([histone H3]-lysine4 N-methyltransferase PRDM7)
GeneName	PRDM7 PFM4
Length	492
Function	Histone methyltransferase that selectively methylates 'Lys-4' of dimethylated histone H3 (H3K4me2) to produce trimethylated 'Lys-4' histone H3 (H3K4me3). May play a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression by defining an active chromatin state.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
