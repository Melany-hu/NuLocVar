ProteinName	Leupaxin
GeneName	LPXN LDLP
Length	386
Function	Transcriptional coactivator for androgen receptor (AR) and serum response factor (SRF). Contributes to the regulation of cell adhesion, spreading and cell migration and acts as a negative regulator in integrin-mediated cell adhesion events. Suppresses the integrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin (PXN). May play a critical role as an adapter protein in the formation of the adhesion zone in osteoclasts. Negatively regulates B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling.
