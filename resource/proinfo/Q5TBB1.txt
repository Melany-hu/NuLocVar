UniprotID	Q5TBB1
Accession	Q5TBB1;G3XAJ1;Q05DR2;Q6PK48;Q9HAF7
EntryName	RNH2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribonuclease H2 subunit B (RNase H2 subunit B) (Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome 2 protein) (AGS2) (Deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 8) (Ribonuclease HI subunit B)
GeneName	RNASEH2B DLEU8
Length	312
Function	Non catalytic subunit of RNase H2, an endonuclease that specifically degrades the RNA of RNA:DNA hybrids. Participates in DNA replication, possibly by mediating the removal of lagging-strand Okazaki fragment RNA primers during DNA replication. Mediates the excision of single ribonucleotides from DNA:RNA duplexes.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
