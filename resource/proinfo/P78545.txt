UniprotID	P78545
Accession	P78545;B2R5Q6;Q6IAP8;Q7RU03;Q7Z3X2;Q8NFG2;Q99718
EntryName	ELF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	ETS-related transcription factor Elf-3 (E74-like factor 3) (Epithelial-restricted with serine box) (Epithelium-restricted Ets protein ESX) (Epithelium-specific Ets transcription factor 1) (ESE-1)
GeneName	ELF3 ERT ESX JEN
Length	371
Function	Transcriptional activator that binds and transactivates ETS sequences containing the consensus nucleotide core sequence GGA. Acts synergistically with POU2F3 to transactivate the SPRR2A promoter and with RUNX1 to transactivate the ANGPT1 promoter. Also transactivates collagenase, CCL20, CLND7, FLG, KRT8, NOS2, PTGS2, SPRR2B, TGFBR2 and TGM3 promoters. Represses KRT4 promoter activity. Involved in mediating vascular inflammation. May play an important role in epithelial cell differentiation and tumorigenesis. May be a critical downstream effector of the ERBB2 signaling pathway. May be associated with mammary gland development and involution. Plays an important role in the regulation of transcription with TATA-less promoters in preimplantation embryos, which is essential in preimplantation development (By similarity).
