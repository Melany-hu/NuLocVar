EntryName	PAQR6_HUMAN
ProteinName	Membrane progestin receptor delta (mPR delta) (Membrane progesterone P4 receptor delta) (Membrane progesterone receptor delta) (Progesterone and adipoQ receptor family member 6) (Progestin and adipoQ receptor family member 6)
GeneName	PAQR6
Length	344
Function	Plasma membrane progesterone (P4) receptor coupled to G proteins (PubMed:23161870, PubMed:23763432). Seems to act through a G(s) mediated pathway (PubMed:23161870). Involved in neurosteroid inhibition of apoptosis (PubMed:23161870). May be involved in regulating rapid P4 signaling in the nervous system (PubMed:23763432). Also binds dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), pregnanolone, pregnenolone and allopregnanolone (PubMed:23161870, PubMed:23763432).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
