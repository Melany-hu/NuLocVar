Accession	Q9NZI2;A0A0C4DFQ7;B7Z7B4;Q3YAD0;Q3YAD1;Q3YAD2;Q3YAD3;Q5U822
EntryName	KCIP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	A-type potassium channel modulatory protein KCNIP1 (Kv channel-interacting protein 1) (KChIP1) (Potassium channel-interacting protein 1) (Vesicle APC-binding protein)
GeneName	KCNIP1 KCHIP1 VABP
Length	227
Function	Regulatory subunit of Kv4/D (Shal)-type voltage-gated rapidly inactivating A-type potassium channels (PubMed:10676964, PubMed:11423117, PubMed:17187064, PubMed:34552243, PubMed:34997220). Regulates channel density, inactivation kinetics and rate of recovery from inactivation in a calcium-dependent and isoform-specific manner (PubMed:10676964, PubMed:11423117, PubMed:17187064, PubMed:34552243, PubMed:34997220). In vitro, modulates KCND1/Kv4.1 and KCND2/Kv4.2 currents (PubMed:34552243). Increases the presence of KCND2 at the cell surface (PubMed:12829703).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Cytoplasm; Cell projection; Dendrite
