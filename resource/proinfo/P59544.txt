UniprotID	P59544
Accession	P59544;P59545;Q2M255;Q645Y0
EntryName	T2R50_HUMAN
ProteinName	Taste receptor type 2 member 50 (T2R50) (Taste receptor type 2 member 51) (T2R51)
GeneName	TAS2R50
Length	299
Function	Receptor that may play a role in the perception of bitterness and is gustducin-linked. May play a role in sensing the chemical composition of the gastrointestinal content. The activity of this receptor may stimulate alpha gustducin, mediate PLC-beta-2 activation and lead to the gating of TRPM5 (By similarity).
