UniprotID	P26599-1
Accession	P26599;Q9BUQ0
EntryName	PTBP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTB) (57 kDa RNA-binding protein PPTB-1) (Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein I) (hnRNP I)
GeneName	PTBP1 PTB
Length	531
Function	Plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing and in the regulation of alternative splicing events. Activates exon skipping of its own pre-mRNA during muscle cell differentiation. Binds to the polypyrimidine tract of introns. May promote RNA looping when bound to two separate polypyrimidine tracts in the same pre-mRNA. May promote the binding of U2 snRNP to pre-mRNA. Cooperates with RAVER1 to modulate switching between mutually exclusive exons during maturation of the TPM1 pre-mRNA. Represses the splicing of MAPT/Tau exon 10 (PubMed:15009664). Binds to polypyrimidine-rich controlling element (PCE) of CFTR and promotes exon skipping of CFTR exon 9, thereby antagonizing TIA1 and its role in exon inclusion of CFTR exon 9 (PubMed:14966131). Plays a role in the splicing of pyruvate kinase PKM by binding repressively to a polypyrimidine tract flanking PKM exon 9, inhibiting exon 9 inclusion and resulting in exon 10 inclusion and production of the PKM M2 isoform (PubMed:20010808). In case of infection by picornaviruses, binds to the viral internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and stimulates the IRES-mediated translation (PubMed:21518806).
