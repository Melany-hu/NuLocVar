Function	Regulatory component of the SET1/COMPASS complex implicated in the tethering of this complex to transcriptional start sites of active genes (PubMed:17998332, PubMed:18838538, PubMed:20516061). Facilitates histone H3 'Lys-4' methylation (H3K4me) via recruitment of the SETD1A or SETD1B to the 'Ser-5' phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II large subunit (POLR2A) (PubMed:17998332, PubMed:18838538). Component of PTW/PP1 phosphatase complex, which plays a role in the control of chromatin structure and cell cycle progression during the transition from mitosis into interphase (PubMed:20516061). Together with ZC3H4, but independently of the SET1 complex, part of a transcription termination checkpoint that promotes transcription termination of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (PubMed:33767452, PubMed:33913806). The transcription termination checkpoint is activated by the inefficiently spliced first exon of lncRNAs and promotes transcription termination of lncRNAs and their subsequent degradation by the exosome (PubMed:33767452).
