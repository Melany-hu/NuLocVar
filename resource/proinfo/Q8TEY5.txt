UniprotID	Q8TEY5
Accession	Q8TEY5;D3DV62;Q5T4L0;Q86YW6
EntryName	CR3L4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 4 (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 4) (Androgen-induced basic leucine zipper protein) (AIbZIP) (Attaching to CRE-like 1) (ATCE1) (Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 4) (CREB-4) (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 4) (Transcript induced in spermiogenesis protein 40) (Tisp40) (hJAL) [Cleaved into: Processed cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like protein 4]
GeneName	CREB3L4 AIBZIP CREB4 JAL
Length	395
Function	Transcriptional activator that may play a role in the unfolded protein response. Binds to the UPR element (UPRE) but not to CRE element. Preferentially binds DNA with to the consensus sequence 5'-TACGT-3' and has transcriptional activation activity from UPRE. Binds to NF-kappa-B site and has transcriptional activation activity from NF-kappa-B-containing regulatory elements (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus membrane; Nucleus
