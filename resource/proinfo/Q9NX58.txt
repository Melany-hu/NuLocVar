EntryName	LYAR_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cell growth-regulating nucleolar protein
GeneName	LYAR PNAS-5
Length	379
Function	Plays a role in the maintenance of the appropriate processing of 47S/45S pre-rRNA to 32S/30S pre-rRNAs and their subsequent processing to produce 18S and 28S rRNAs (PubMed:24495227). Also acts at the level of transcription regulation. Along with PRMT5, binds the gamma-globin (HBG1/HBG2) promoter and represses its expression (PubMed:25092918). In neuroblastoma cells, may also repress the expression of oxidative stress genes, including CHAC1, HMOX1, SLC7A11, ULBP1 and SNORD41 that encodes a small nucleolar RNA (PubMed:28686580). Preferentially binds to a DNA motif containing 5'-GGTTAT-3' (PubMed:25092918). Negatively regulates the antiviral innate immune response by targeting IRF3 and impairing its DNA-binding activity (PubMed:31413131). In addition, inhibits NF-kappa-B-mediated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PubMed:31413131). Stimulates phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by retinal pigment epithelial cells (By similarity). Prevents nucleolin/NCL self-cleavage, maintaining a normal steady-state level of NCL protein in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which in turn is essential for ESC self-renewal (By similarity).
