UniprotID	P49419
Accession	P49419;B2R669;B4DIC7;B4DMA0;E7EPT3;O14619;Q6IPU8;Q9BUL4
EntryName	AL7A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Alpha-AASA dehydrogenase) (EC 1.2.1.31) (Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 7 member A1) (EC 1.2.1.3) (Antiquitin-1) (Betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase) (EC 1.2.1.8) (Delta1-piperideine-6-carboxylate dehydrogenase) (P6c dehydrogenase)
GeneName	ALDH7A1 ATQ1
Length	539
Function	Multifunctional enzyme mediating important protective effects. Metabolizes betaine aldehyde to betaine, an important cellular osmolyte and methyl donor. Protects cells from oxidative stress by metabolizing a number of lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes. Involved in lysine catabolism.
