UniprotID	P16422
Accession	P16422;P18180;Q6FG26;Q6FG49;Q96C47;Q9UCD0
EntryName	EPCAM_HUMAN
ProteinName	Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM) (Adenocarcinoma-associated antigen) (Cell surface glycoprotein Trop-1) (Epithelial cell surface antigen) (Epithelial glycoprotein) (EGP) (Epithelial glycoprotein 314) (EGP314) (hEGP314) (KS 1/4 antigen) (KSA) (Major gastrointestinal tumor-associated protein GA733-2) (Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 1) (CD antigen CD326)
GeneName	EPCAM GA733-2 M1S2 M4S1 MIC18 TACSTD1 TROP1
Length	314
Function	May act as a physical homophilic interaction molecule between intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) at the mucosal epithelium for providing immunological barrier as a first line of defense against mucosal infection. Plays a role in embryonic stem cells proliferation and differentiation. Up-regulates the expression of FABP5, MYC and cyclins A and E.
Subcellular Location	Lateral cell membrane; Cell junction; Tight junction
