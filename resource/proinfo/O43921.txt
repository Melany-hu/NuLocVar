UniprotID	O43921
Accession	O43921;O76020
EntryName	EFNA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ephrin-A2 (EPH-related receptor tyrosine kinase ligand 6) (LERK-6) (HEK7 ligand) (HEK7-L)
GeneName	EFNA2 EPLG6 LERK6
Length	213
Function	Cell surface GPI-bound ligand for Eph receptors, a family of receptor tyrosine kinases which are crucial for migration, repulsion and adhesion during neuronal, vascular and epithelial development. Binds promiscuously Eph receptors residing on adjacent cells, leading to contact-dependent bidirectional signaling into neighboring cells. The signaling pathway downstream of the receptor is referred to as forward signaling while the signaling pathway downstream of the ephrin ligand is referred to as reverse signaling. With the EPHA2 receptor may play a role in bone remodeling through regulation of osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis (By similarity).
