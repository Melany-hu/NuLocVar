EntryName	CXCR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	C-X-C chemokine receptor type 1 (CXC-R1) (CXCR-1) (CDw128a) (High affinity interleukin-8 receptor A) (IL-8R A) (IL-8 receptor type 1) (CD antigen CD181)
GeneName	CXCR1 CMKAR1 IL8RA
Length	350
Function	Receptor to interleukin-8, which is a powerful neutrophils chemotactic factor (PubMed:1840701). Binding of IL-8 to the receptor causes activation of neutrophils. This response is mediated via a G-protein that activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system (PubMed:8662698).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
