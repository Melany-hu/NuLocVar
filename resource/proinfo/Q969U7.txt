UniprotID	Q969U7
Accession	Q969U7;B0YJB3;Q6IAH4;Q9NRV1;V9GYH7
EntryName	PSMG2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Proteasome assembly chaperone 2 (PAC-2) (Hepatocellular carcinoma-susceptibility protein 3) (Tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 5-induced protein 1)
GeneName	PSMG2 HCCA3 PAC2 TNFSF5IP1
Length	264
Function	Chaperone protein which promotes assembly of the 20S proteasome as part of a heterodimer with PSMG1. The PSMG1-PSMG2 heterodimer binds to the PSMA5 and PSMA7 proteasome subunits, promotes assembly of the proteasome alpha subunits into the heteroheptameric alpha ring and prevents alpha ring dimerization.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
