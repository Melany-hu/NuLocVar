EntryName	GNAS2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(s) subunit alpha isoforms short (EC 3.6.5.-) (Adenylate cyclase-stimulating G alpha protein)
GeneName	GNAS GNAS1 GSP
Length	394
Function	Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) function as transducers in numerous signaling pathways controlled by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (PubMed:12391161, PubMed:17110384, PubMed:21488135, PubMed:26206488, PubMed:8702665, PubMed:10200251). The alpha chain contains the guanine nucleotide binding site and alternates between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state (PubMed:12391161, PubMed:17110384, PubMed:10200251). Signaling by an activated GPCR promotes GDP release and GTP binding (PubMed:12391161, PubMed:17110384, PubMed:10200251). The alpha subunit has a low GTPase activity that converts bound GTP to GDP, thereby terminating the signal (PubMed:12391161, PubMed:17110384, PubMed:10200251). Both GDP release and GTP hydrolysis are modulated by numerous regulatory proteins (PubMed:12391161, PubMed:17110384, PubMed:10200251). Signaling involves the activation of adenylyl cyclases, resulting in increased levels of the signaling molecule cAMP (PubMed:17110384, PubMed:26206488, PubMed:26206488, PubMed:8702665). Functions downstream of beta-adrenergic receptors (PubMed:21488135). Stimulates the Ras signaling pathway via RAPGEF2 (PubMed:12391161).
