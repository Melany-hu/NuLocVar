UniprotID	Q969S6
Accession	Q969S6;Q6NW08
EntryName	TM203_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 203
GeneName	TMEM203
Length	136
Function	Involved in the regulation of cellular calcium homeotasis (PubMed:25996873). Required for spermatogenesis (PubMed:25996873). Acts as a regulator of STING-mediated inflammatory signaling in macrophages (PubMed:31346090). Forms a complex with STING, promoting the activity of TBK1 kinase and the transcription factor IRF3, leading to activation of type I interferon expression (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment; Lysosome membrane
