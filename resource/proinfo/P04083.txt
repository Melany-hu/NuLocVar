EntryName	ANXA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Annexin A1 (Annexin I) (Annexin-1) (Calpactin II) (Calpactin-2) (Chromobindin-9) (Lipocortin I) (Phospholipase A2 inhibitory protein) (p35) [Cleaved into: Annexin Ac2-26]
GeneName	ANXA1 ANX1 LPC1
Length	346
Function	Plays important roles in the innate immune response as effector of glucocorticoid-mediated responses and regulator of the inflammatory process. Has anti-inflammatory activity (PubMed:8425544). Plays a role in glucocorticoid-mediated down-regulation of the early phase of the inflammatory response (By similarity). Contributes to the adaptive immune response by enhancing signaling cascades that are triggered by T-cell activation, regulates differentiation and proliferation of activated T-cells (PubMed:17008549). Promotes the differentiation of T-cells into Th1 cells and negatively regulates differentiation into Th2 cells (PubMed:17008549). Has no effect on unstimulated T cells (PubMed:17008549). Negatively regulates hormone exocytosis via activation of the formyl peptide receptors and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (PubMed:19625660). Has high affinity for Ca(2+) and can bind up to eight Ca(2+) ions (By similarity). Displays Ca(2+)-dependent binding to phospholipid membranes (PubMed:2532504, PubMed:8557678). Plays a role in the formation of phagocytic cups and phagosomes. Plays a role in phagocytosis by mediating the Ca(2+)-dependent interaction between phagosomes and the actin cytoskeleton (By similarity).
