EntryName	GPHRB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Golgi pH regulator B (Protein GPR89B)
GeneName	GPR89B GPHR GPR89 GPR89C SH120 HSPC201
Length	455
Function	Voltage-gated channel that enables the transfer of anions such as iodide, chloride, bromide and fluoride which may function in counter-ion conductance and participates in Golgi acidification (PubMed:18794847). Plays a role in lymphocyte development, probably by acting as a RABL3 effector in hematopoietic cells (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
