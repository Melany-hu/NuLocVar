EntryName	ST2A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sulfotransferase 2A1 (ST2A1) (EC 2.8.2.2) (Bile salt sulfotransferase) (EC 2.8.2.14) (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase) (DHEA-ST) (DHEA-ST8) (Hydroxysteroid Sulfotransferase) (HST) (ST2) (SULT2A3)
GeneName	SULT2A1 HST STD
Length	285
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) as sulfonate donor to catalyze the sulfonation of steroids and bile acids in the liver and adrenal glands. Mediates the sulfation of a wide range of steroids and sterols, including pregnenolone, androsterone, DHEA, bile acids, cholesterol and as well many xenobiotics that contain alcohol and phenol functional groups (PubMed:14573603, PubMed:18042734, PubMed:19589875, PubMed:21187059, PubMed:2268288, PubMed:29671343, PubMed:7678732, PubMed:7854148). Sulfonation increases the water solubility of most compounds, and therefore their renal excretion, but it can also result in bioactivation to form active metabolites. Plays an important role in maintening steroid and lipid homeostasis (PubMed:14573603, PubMed:19589875, PubMed:21187059). Plays a key role in bile acid metabolism (PubMed:2268288). In addition, catalyzes the metabolic activation of potent carcinogenic polycyclic arylmethanols (By similarity).
