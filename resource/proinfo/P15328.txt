UniprotID	P15328
Accession	P15328;Q53EW2;Q6FGT8;Q6LC90;Q9UCT2
EntryName	FOLR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Folate receptor alpha (FR-alpha) (Adult folate-binding protein) (FBP) (Folate receptor 1) (Folate receptor, adult) (KB cells FBP) (Ovarian tumor-associated antigen MOv18)
GeneName	FOLR1 FOLR
Length	257
Function	Binds to folate and reduced folic acid derivatives and mediates delivery of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and folate analogs into the interior of cells (PubMed:19074442, PubMed:23851396, PubMed:23934049, PubMed:2527252, PubMed:8033114, PubMed:8567728). Has high affinity for folate and folic acid analogs at neutral pH (PubMed:23851396, PubMed:23934049, PubMed:2527252, PubMed:8033114, PubMed:8567728). Exposure to slightly acidic pH after receptor endocytosis triggers a conformation change that strongly reduces its affinity for folates and mediates their release (PubMed:8567728). Required for normal embryonic development and normal cell proliferation (By similarity).
