UniprotID	P47902
Accession	P47902;Q4VAU4;Q9NYK8
EntryName	CDX1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Homeobox protein CDX-1 (Caudal-type homeobox protein 1)
GeneName	CDX1
Length	265
Function	Plays a role in transcriptional regulation (PubMed:24623306). Involved in activated KRAS-mediated transcriptional activation of PRKD1 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306). Binds to the PRKD1 promoter in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells (PubMed:24623306). Could play a role in the terminal differentiation of the intestine. Binds preferentially to methylated DNA (PubMed:28473536).
