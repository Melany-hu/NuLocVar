UniprotID	Q05923
Accession	Q05923;Q53T45
EntryName	DUSP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dual specificity protein phosphatase 2 (EC 3.1.3.16) (EC 3.1.3.48) (Dual specificity protein phosphatase PAC-1)
GeneName	DUSP2 PAC1
Length	314
Function	Dephosphorylates both phosphorylated Thr and Tyr residues in MAPK1, and dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosine is slightly faster than that of phosphothreonine (PubMed:8107850). Can dephosphorylate MAPK1 (By similarity).
