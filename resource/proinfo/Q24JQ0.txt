UniprotID	Q24JQ0
Accession	Q24JQ0;I0J130;Q6ZTS7;Q6ZW41
EntryName	TM241_HUMAN
ProteinName	UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter TMEM241 (Solute carrier family 35 member D4) (Transmembrane protein 241)
GeneName	TMEM241 C18orf45
Length	296
Function	Golgi-localized UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) transporter that transports UDP-N-acetylglucosamine into Golgi lumen. Contributes to lysosomal targeting of NPC2, a key protein required for lysosomal cholesterol exiting, and that utilizes the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) modification pathway for its lysosomal targeting.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus; cis-Golgi network membrane
