Accession	Q5SZQ8;B7ZKK6;O15414;Q499Y6;Q5SZQ7;Q6NVK0;Q8IZ98;Q9BZC2;Q9HB30
EntryName	CELF3_HUMAN
ProteinName	CUGBP Elav-like family member 3 (CELF-3) (Bruno-like protein 1) (CAG repeat protein 4) (CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like factor 3) (ELAV-type RNA-binding protein 1) (ETR-1) (Expanded repeat domain protein CAG/CTG 4) (RNA-binding protein BRUNOL-1) (Trinucleotide repeat-containing gene 4 protein)
GeneName	CELF3 BRUNOL1 CAGH4 ERDA4 TNRC4
Length	465
Function	RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. Mediates exon inclusion and/or exclusion in pre-mRNA that are subject to tissue-specific and developmentally regulated alternative splicing. Specifically activates exon 5 inclusion of cardiac isoforms of TNNT2 during heart remodeling at the juvenile to adult transition. Activates the splicing of MAPT/Tau exon 10. Binds to muscle-specific splicing enhancer (MSE) intronic sites flanking the alternative exon 5 of TNNT2 pre-mRNA.
