UniprotID	P31146
Accession	P31146;B2RBL1;Q2YD73
EntryName	COR1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Coronin-1A (Coronin-like protein A) (Clipin-A) (Coronin-like protein p57) (Tryptophan aspartate-containing coat protein) (TACO)
GeneName	CORO1A CORO1
Length	461
Function	May be a crucial component of the cytoskeleton of highly motile cells, functioning both in the invagination of large pieces of plasma membrane, as well as in forming protrusions of the plasma membrane involved in cell locomotion. In mycobacteria-infected cells, its retention on the phagosomal membrane prevents fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes.
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cytoplasm; Cell cortex; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Phagosome membrane
