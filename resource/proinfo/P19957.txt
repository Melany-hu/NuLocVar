UniprotID	P19957
Accession	P19957;E1P618;Q6FG74
EntryName	ELAF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Elafin (Elastase-specific inhibitor) (ESI) (Peptidase inhibitor 3) (PI-3) (Protease inhibitor WAP3) (Skin-derived antileukoproteinase) (SKALP) (WAP four-disulfide core domain protein 14)
GeneName	PI3 WAP3 WFDC14
Length	117
Function	Neutrophil and pancreatic elastase-specific inhibitor of skin. It may prevent elastase-mediated tissue proteolysis. Has been shown to inhibit the alpha-4-beta-2/CHRNA2-CHRNB2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and to produce a weak inhibition on Kv11.1/KCNH2/ERG1 and on the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) (PubMed:29483648).
