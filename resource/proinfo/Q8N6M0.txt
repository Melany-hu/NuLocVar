UniprotID	Q8N6M0
Accession	Q8N6M0;A8K6I1;B4DEY0;Q9NTA4;Q9Y387
EntryName	OTU6B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Deubiquitinase OTUD6B (EC 3.4.19.12) (DUBA-5) (OTU domain-containing protein 6B)
GeneName	OTUD6B DUBA5 CGI-77
Length	293
Function	Deubiquitinating enzyme that may play a role in the ubiquitin-dependent regulation of protein synthesis, downstream of mTORC1 (PubMed:21267069, PubMed:27864334). May associate with the protein synthesis initiation complex and modify its ubiquitination to repress translation (PubMed:27864334). May also repress DNA synthesis and modify different cellular targets thereby regulating cell growth and proliferation (PubMed:27864334). May also play a role in proteasome assembly and function (PubMed:28343629).
