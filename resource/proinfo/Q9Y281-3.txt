UniprotID	Q9Y281-3
Accession	Q9Y281;G3V5P4
EntryName	COF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cofilin-2 (Cofilin, muscle isoform)
GeneName	CFL2
Length	149
Function	Controls reversibly actin polymerization and depolymerization in a pH-sensitive manner. Its F-actin depolymerization activity is regulated by association with CSPR3 (PubMed:19752190). It has the ability to bind G- and F-actin in a 1:1 ratio of cofilin to actin. It is the major component of intranuclear and cytoplasmic actin rods. Required for muscle maintenance. May play a role during the exchange of alpha-actin forms during the early postnatal remodeling of the sarcomere (By similarity).
