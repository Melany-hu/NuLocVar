UniprotID	Q9BUA3
Accession	Q9BUA3;Q68CV7;Q6PHS2;Q96IH0
EntryName	SPNDC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Spindlin interactor and repressor of chromatin-binding protein (SPIN1-docking protein) (SPIN-DOC)
GeneName	SPINDOC C11orf84
Length	381
Function	Chromatin protein that stabilizes SPIN1 and enhances its association with histone H3 trimethylated at both 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-9' (H3K4me3K9me3) (PubMed:33574238). Positively regulates poly-ADP-ribosylation in response to DNA damage; acts by facilitating PARP1 ADP-ribosyltransferase activity (PubMed:34737271).
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
