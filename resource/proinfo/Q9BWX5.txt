EntryName	GATA5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor GATA-5 (GATA-binding factor 5)
GeneName	GATA5
Length	397
Function	Transcription factor required during cardiovascular development (PubMed:23289003). Plays an important role in the transcriptional program(s) that underlies smooth muscle cell diversity (By similarity). Binds to the functionally important CEF-1 nuclear protein binding site in the cardiac-specific slow/cardiac troponin C transcriptional enhancer (PubMed:25543888).
