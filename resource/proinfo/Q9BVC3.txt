UniprotID	Q9BVC3
Accession	Q9BVC3;Q969N5
EntryName	DCC1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sister chromatid cohesion protein DCC1 (Defective in sister chromatid cohesion protein 1 homolog)
GeneName	DSCC1 DCC1 UNQ9337/PRO34008
Length	393
Function	Loads PCNA onto primed templates regulating velocity, spacing and restart activity of replication forks. May couple DNA replication to sister chromatid cohesion through regulation of the acetylation of the cohesin subunit SMC3.
