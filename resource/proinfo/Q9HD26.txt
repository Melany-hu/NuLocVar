UniprotID	Q9HD26
Accession	Q9HD26;A6NM30;Q59FS4;Q969U8
EntryName	GOPC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing protein (CFTR-associated ligand) (Fused in glioblastoma) (PDZ protein interacting specifically with TC10) (PIST)
GeneName	GOPC CAL FIG
Length	462
Function	Plays a role in intracellular protein trafficking and degradation (PubMed:11707463, PubMed:14570915, PubMed:15358775). May regulate CFTR chloride currents and acid-induced ASIC3 currents by modulating cell surface expression of both channels (By similarity). May also regulate the intracellular trafficking of the ADR1B receptor (PubMed:15358775). May play a role in autophagy (By similarity). Together with MARCHF2 mediates the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of CFTR (PubMed:23818989). Overexpression results in CFTR intracellular retention and lysosomaldegradation in the lysosomes (PubMed:11707463, PubMed:14570915).
