EntryName	SNX27_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sorting nexin-27
GeneName	SNX27 KIAA0488 My014
Length	541
Function	Involved in the retrograde transport from endosome to plasma membrane, a trafficking pathway that promotes the recycling of internalized transmembrane proteins. Following internalization, endocytosed transmembrane proteins are delivered to early endosomes and recycled to the plasma membrane instead of being degraded in lysosomes. SNX27 specifically binds and directs sorting of a subset of transmembrane proteins containing a PDZ-binding motif at the C-terminus: following interaction with target transmembrane proteins, associates with the retromer complex, preventing entry into the lysosomal pathway, and promotes retromer-tubule based plasma membrane recycling. SNX27 also binds with the WASH complex. Interacts with membranes containing phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3P)). May participate in establishment of natural killer cell polarity. Recruits CYTIP to early endosomes.
