UniprotID	Q8TB40
Accession	Q8TB40;B4DDH7;Q9H9E0
EntryName	ABHD4_HUMAN
ProteinName	(Lyso)-N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine lipase (EC 3.1.1.-) (Alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 4) (Abhydrolase domain-containing protein 4) (Alpha/beta-hydrolase 4)
GeneName	ABHD4
Length	342
Function	Lysophospholipase selective for N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). Contributes to the biosynthesis of N-acyl ethanolamines, including the endocannabinoid anandamide by hydrolyzing the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains from N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) generating glycerophospho-N-acyl ethanolamine (GP-NAE), an intermediate for N-acyl ethanolamine biosynthesis. Hydrolyzes substrates bearing saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated N-acyl chains. Shows no significant activity towards other lysophospholipids, including lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylserine.
