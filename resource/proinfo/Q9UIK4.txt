EntryName	DAPK2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Death-associated protein kinase 2 (DAP kinase 2) (EC 2.7.11.1) (DAP-kinase-related protein 1) (DRP-1)
GeneName	DAPK2
Length	370
Function	Calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase involved in multiple cellular signaling pathways that trigger cell survival, apoptosis, and autophagy. Regulates both type I apoptotic and type II autophagic cell death signals, depending on the cellular setting. The former is caspase-dependent, while the latter is caspase-independent and is characterized by the accumulation of autophagic vesicles. Acts as a mediator of anoikis and a suppressor of beta-catenin-dependent anchorage-independent growth of malignant epithelial cells. May play a role in granulocytic maturation (PubMed:17347302). Regulates granulocytic motility by controlling cell spreading and polarization (PubMed:24163421).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome lumen
