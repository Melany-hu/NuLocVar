EntryName	ISPD_HUMAN
ProteinName	D-ribitol-5-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.40) (2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase-like protein) (Isoprenoid synthase domain-containing protein) (hISPD)
GeneName	CRPPA ISPD
Length	451
Function	Cytidylyltransferase required for protein O-linked mannosylation (PubMed:22522420, PubMed:22522421, PubMed:26687144, PubMed:26923585, PubMed:27130732, PubMed:27601598). Catalyzes the formation of CDP-ribitol nucleotide sugar from D-ribitol 5-phosphate (PubMed:26687144, PubMed:26923585, PubMed:27130732). CDP-ribitol is a substrate of FKTN during the biosynthesis of the phosphorylated O-mannosyl trisaccharide (N-acetylgalactosamine-beta-3-N-acetylglucosamine-beta-4-(phosphate-6-)mannose), a carbohydrate structure present in alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1), which is required for binding laminin G-like domain-containing extracellular proteins with high affinity (PubMed:26687144, PubMed:26923585, PubMed:27130732). Shows activity toward other pentose phosphate sugars and mediates formation of CDP-ribulose or CDP-ribose using CTP and ribulose-5-phosphate or ribose-5-phosphate, respectively (PubMed:26687144). Not Involved in dolichol production (PubMed:26687144).
