GeneName	OPN3 ECPN
Length	402
Function	G-protein coupled receptor which selectively activates G proteins via ultraviolet A (UVA) light-mediated activation in the skin (PubMed:28842328, PubMed:31097585, PubMed:31380578). Binds both 11-cis retinal and all-trans retinal (PubMed:31097585). Regulates melanogenesis in melanocytes via inhibition of alpha-MSH-induced MC1R-mediated cAMP signaling, modulation of calcium flux, regulation of CAMK2 phosphorylation, and subsequently phosphorylation of CREB, p38, ERK and MITF in response to blue light (PubMed:28842328, PubMed:31097585). Plays a role in melanocyte survival through regulation of intracellular calcium levels and subsequent BCL2/RAF1 signaling (PubMed:31730232). Additionally regulates apoptosis via cytochrome c release and subsequent activation of the caspase cascade (PubMed:31730232). Required for TYR and DCT blue light-induced complex formation in melanocytes (PubMed:28842328). Involved in keratinocyte differentiation in response to blue-light (PubMed:30168605). Required for the UVA-mediated induction of calcium and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling resulting in the expression of MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP9 and TIMP1 in dermal fibroblasts (PubMed:31380578). Plays a role in light-mediated glucose uptake, mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid metabolism in brown adipocyte tissues (By similarity). May be involved in photorelaxation of airway smooth muscle cells, via blue-light dependent GPCR signaling pathways (By similarity).
