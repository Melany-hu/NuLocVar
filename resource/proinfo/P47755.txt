UniprotID	P47755
Accession	P47755;B4DG50
EntryName	CAZA2_HUMAN
ProteinName	F-actin-capping protein subunit alpha-2 (CapZ alpha-2)
GeneName	CAPZA2
Length	286
Function	F-actin-capping proteins bind in a Ca(2+)-independent manner to the fast growing ends of actin filaments (barbed end) thereby blocking the exchange of subunits at these ends. Unlike other capping proteins (such as gelsolin and severin), these proteins do not sever actin filaments.
