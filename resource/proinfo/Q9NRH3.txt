ProteinName	Tubulin gamma-2 chain (Gamma-2-tubulin)
GeneName	TUBG2
Length	451
Function	Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules. The gamma chain is found at microtubule organizing centers (MTOC) such as the spindle poles or the centrosome. Pericentriolar matrix component that regulates alpha/beta chain minus-end nucleation, centrosome duplication and spindle formation (By similarity).
