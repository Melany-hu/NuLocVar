UniprotID	Q9Y5R6-3
Accession	Q9Y5R6;B2R913;Q6T1H8;Q6T1H9;Q8IW77
EntryName	DMRT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Doublesex- and mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (DM domain expressed in testis protein 1)
GeneName	DMRT1 DMT1
Length	175
Function	Transcription factor that plays a key role in male sex determination and differentiation by controlling testis development and male germ cell proliferation. Plays a central role in spermatogonia by inhibiting meiosis in undifferentiated spermatogonia and promoting mitosis, leading to spermatogonial development and allowing abundant and continuous production of sperm. Acts both as a transcription repressor and activator: prevents meiosis by restricting retinoic acid (RA)-dependent transcription and repressing STRA8 expression and promotes spermatogonial development by activating spermatogonial differentiation genes, such as SOHLH1. Also plays a key role in postnatal sex maintenance by maintaining testis determination and preventing feminization: represses transcription of female promoting genes such as FOXL2 and activates male-specific genes. May act as a tumor suppressor. May also play a minor role in oogenesis (By similarity).
