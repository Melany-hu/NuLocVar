UniprotID	Q9UBX3
Accession	Q9UBX3;Q542Z3;Q96BA1;Q96IP1
EntryName	DIC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier (DIC) (Solute carrier family 25 member 10)
GeneName	SLC25A10 DIC
Length	287
Function	Catalyzes the electroneutral exchange or flux of physiologically important metabolites such as dicarboxylates (malonate, malate, succinate), inorganic sulfur-containing anions, and phosphate, across mitochondrial inner membrane (PubMed:29211846). Plays an important role in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, urea synthesis, and sulfur metabolism, particularly in liver, by supplying the substrates for the different metabolic processes. Regulates fatty acid release from adipocytes, and contributes to systemic insulin sensitivity (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion inner membrane
