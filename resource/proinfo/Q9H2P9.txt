UniprotID	Q9H2P9
Accession	Q9H2P9;A8JZY6;D3DT62;Q9P017;Q9P0I4;Q9Y319
EntryName	DPH5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Diphthine methyl ester synthase (EC 2.1.1.314) (Diphthamide biosynthesis methyltransferase)
GeneName	DPH5 AD-018 CGI-30 HSPC143 NPD015
Length	285
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase that catalyzes four methylations of the modified target histidine residue in translation elongation factor 2 (EF-2), to form an intermediate called diphthine methyl ester. The four successive methylation reactions represent the second step of diphthamide biosynthesis.
