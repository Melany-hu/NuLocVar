UniprotID	P55103
Accession	P55103;A1L3Y2
EntryName	INHBC_HUMAN
ProteinName	Inhibin beta C chain (Activin beta-C chain)
GeneName	INHBC
Length	352
Function	Inhibins and activins inhibit and activate, respectively, the secretion of follitropin by the pituitary gland. Inhibins/activins are involved in regulating a number of diverse functions such as hypothalamic and pituitary hormone secretion, gonadal hormone secretion, germ cell development and maturation, erythroid differentiation, insulin secretion, nerve cell survival, embryonic axial development or bone growth, depending on their subunit composition. Inhibins appear to oppose the functions of activins.
