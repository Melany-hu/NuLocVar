ProteinName	Tubulin alpha-1A chain (EC 3.6.5.-) (Alpha-tubulin 3) (Tubulin B-alpha-1) (Tubulin alpha-3 chain) [Cleaved into: Detyrosinated tubulin alpha-1A chain]
GeneName	TUBA1A TUBA3
Length	451
Function	Tubulin is the major constituent of microtubules, a cylinder consisting of laterally associated linear protofilaments composed of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers. Microtubules grow by the addition of GTP-tubulin dimers to the microtubule end, where a stabilizing cap forms. Below the cap, tubulin dimers are in GDP-bound state, owing to GTPase activity of alpha-tubulin.
