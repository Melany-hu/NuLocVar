UniprotID	Q8WU39
Accession	Q8WU39;D2IYS0;Q7Z6N2;Q96RL5;Q9P0T3
EntryName	MZB1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Marginal zone B- and B1-cell-specific protein (Mesenteric estrogen-dependent adipose 7) (MEDA-7) (Plasma cell-induced resident endoplasmic reticulum protein) (Plasma cell-induced resident ER protein) (pERp1) (Proapoptotic caspase adapter protein)
GeneName	MZB1 MEDA7 PACAP HSPC190
Length	189
Function	Associates with immunoglobulin M (IgM) heavy and light chains and promotes IgM assembly and secretion. May exert its effect by acting as a molecular chaperone or as an oxidoreductase as it displays a low level of oxidoreductase activity (By similarity). Isoform 2 may be involved in regulation of apoptosis. Helps to diversify peripheral B-cell functions by regulating Ca(2+) stores, antibody secretion and integrin activation.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum lumen; Secreted; Cytoplasm
