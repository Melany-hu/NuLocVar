UniprotID	Q9H228
Accession	Q9H228;Q6NW11
EntryName	S1PR5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 5 (S1P receptor 5) (S1P5) (Endothelial differentiation G-protein-coupled receptor 8) (Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor Edg-8) (S1P receptor Edg-8)
GeneName	S1PR5 EDG8
Length	398
Function	Receptor for the lysosphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is a bioactive lysophospholipid that elicits diverse physiological effect on most types of cells and tissues. Is coupled to both the G(i/0)alpha and G(12) subclass of heteromeric G-proteins (By similarity). May play a regulatory role in the transformation of radial glial cells into astrocytes and may affect proliferative activity of these cells.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
