UniprotID	O60925
Accession	O60925;B2RD02;Q53F95;Q96EX6
EntryName	PFD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Prefoldin subunit 1
GeneName	PFDN1 PFD1
Length	122
Function	Binds specifically to cytosolic chaperonin (c-CPN) and transfers target proteins to it. Binds to nascent polypeptide chain and promotes folding in an environment in which there are many competing pathways for nonnative proteins.
