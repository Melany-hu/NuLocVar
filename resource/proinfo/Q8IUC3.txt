UniprotID	Q8IUC3
Accession	Q8IUC3;Q3LI56
EntryName	KRA71_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 7-1 (High tyrosine-glycine keratin-associated protein 7.1)
GeneName	KRTAP7-1 KAP7.1 KRTAP7.1
Length	87
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
