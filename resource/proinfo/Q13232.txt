UniprotID	Q13232
Accession	Q13232;Q9BWH4
EntryName	NDK3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Nucleoside diphosphate kinase 3 (NDK 3) (NDP kinase 3) (EC 2.7.4.6) (DR-nm23) (Nucleoside diphosphate kinase C) (NDPKC) (nm23-H3)
GeneName	NME3
Length	169
Function	Catalyzes the phosphorylation of ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, other than ATP, into the corresponding triphosphates with ATP as the major phosphate donor (PubMed:11277919, PubMed:30587587). The ATP gamma phosphate is transferred to the nucleoside diphosphate beta phosphate via a ping-pong mechanism, using a phosphorylated active-site intermediate. Through the catalyzed exchange of gamma-phosphate between di- and triphosphonucleosides participates in regulation of intracellular nucleotide homeostasis (PubMed:11277919, PubMed:30587587). Inhibits granulocyte differentiation (PubMed:7638209). May be required for ciliary function during renal development (By similarity).
