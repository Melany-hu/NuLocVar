UniprotID	Q9Y644
Accession	Q9Y644;O00588
EntryName	RFNG_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase radical fringe (EC 2.4.1.222) (O-fucosylpeptide 3-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase)
GeneName	RFNG
Length	331
Function	Glycosyltransferase that initiates the elongation of O-linked fucose residues attached to EGF-like repeats in the extracellular domain of Notch molecules. Modulates NOTCH1 activity by modifying O-fucose residues at specific EGF-like domains resulting in enhancement of NOTCH1 activation by DLL1 and JAG1. May be involved in limb formation and in neurogenesis.
Subcellular Location	Golgi apparatus membrane
