UniprotID	Q9BYQ6
Accession	Q9BYQ6;A0AUY2
EntryName	KR411_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 4-11 (Keratin-associated protein 4-14) (Keratin-associated protein 4.11) (Keratin-associated protein 4.14) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 4.14)
GeneName	KRTAP4-11 KAP4.14 KRTAP4-14 KRTAP4.11 KRTAP4.14
Length	195
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
