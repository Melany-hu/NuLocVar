EntryName	TEAD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcriptional enhancer factor TEF-1 (NTEF-1) (Protein GT-IIC) (TEA domain family member 1) (TEAD-1) (Transcription factor 13) (TCF-13)
GeneName	TEAD1 TCF13 TEF1
Length	426
Function	Transcription factor which plays a key role in the Hippo signaling pathway, a pathway involved in organ size control and tumor suppression by restricting proliferation and promoting apoptosis. The core of this pathway is composed of a kinase cascade wherein MST1/MST2, in complex with its regulatory protein SAV1, phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2 in complex with its regulatory protein MOB1, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates YAP1 oncoprotein and WWTR1/TAZ. Acts by mediating gene expression of YAP1 and WWTR1/TAZ, thereby regulating cell proliferation, migration and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction. Binds specifically and cooperatively to the SPH and GT-IIC 'enhansons' (5'-GTGGAATGT-3') and activates transcription in vivo in a cell-specific manner. The activation function appears to be mediated by a limiting cell-specific transcriptional intermediary factor (TIF). Involved in cardiac development. Binds to the M-CAT motif.
