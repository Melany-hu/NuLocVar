EntryName	AUP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lipid droplet-regulating VLDL assembly factor AUP1 (Ancient ubiquitous protein 1)
GeneName	AUP1
Length	410
Function	Plays a role in the translocation of terminally misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum lumen to the cytoplasm and their degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:18711132, PubMed:21857022). Plays a role in lipid droplet formation (PubMed:21857022). Induces lipid droplet clustering (PubMed:24039768). Recruits ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2G2 to lipid droplets which facilitates its interaction with ubiquitin ligases AMFR/gp78 and RNF139/TRC8, leading to sterol-induced ubiquitination of HMGCR and its subsequent proteasomal degradation (PubMed:21127063, PubMed:23223569). Also required for the degradation of INSIG1, SREBF1 and SREBF2 (PubMed:23223569). Plays a role in regulating assembly and secretion of very low density lipoprotein particles and stability of apolipoprotein APOB (PubMed:28183703).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Lipid droplet; Cytoplasmic vesicle; Autophagosome
