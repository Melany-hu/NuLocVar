UniprotID	Q9BQ90
Accession	Q9BQ90;A8K2W9
EntryName	KLDC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kelch domain-containing protein 3 (Testis intracellular mediator protein)
GeneName	KLHDC3 PEAS
Length	382
Function	Substrate-recognition component of a Cul2-RING (CRL2) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex of the DesCEND (destruction via C-end degrons) pathway, which recognizes a C-degron located at the extreme C terminus of target proteins, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:29775578, PubMed:29779948). The C-degron recognized by the DesCEND pathway is usually a motif of less than ten residues and can be present in full-length proteins, truncated proteins or proteolytically cleaved forms (PubMed:29775578, PubMed:29779948). The CRL2(KLHDC3) complex specifically recognizes proteins with a glycine (Gly) at the C-terminus, leading to their ubiquitination and degradation: recognizes the C-terminal -Arg-(Xaa)n-Arg-Gly, -Arg-(Xaa)n-Lys-Gly, and -Arg-(Xaa)n-Gln-Gly degrons (PubMed:29775578, PubMed:29779948). The CRL2(KLHDC3) complex mediates ubiquitination and degradation of truncated SELENOV and SEPHS2 selenoproteins produced by failed UGA/Sec decoding, which end with a glycine (PubMed:26138980). May be involved in meiotic recombination process (PubMed:12606021).
