Length	323
Function	Acts as a regulator of autophagy in response to S.aureus infection by promoting activation of LC3 (MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B or MAP1LC3C). Acts by interacting with ATG16L1, leading to promote a functional complex between LC3 and ATG16L1 and promoting LC3 lipidation and subsequent activation of autophagy (PubMed:23376921, PubMed:27273576). Modulates the O-glycosylation and complex N-glycosylation steps occurring during the Golgi maturation of several proteins such as APP, BACE1, SEAP or PRNP (PubMed:20427278). Inhibits APP transport to the cell surface and further shedding (PubMed:20427278).
