UniprotID	Q9BXH1
Accession	Q9BXH1;B9EGI3;O00171;Q96PG9
EntryName	BBC3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Bcl-2-binding component 3, isoforms 1/2 (JFY-1) (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis)
GeneName	BBC3 PUMA
Length	193
Function	Essential mediator of p53/TP53-dependent and p53/TP53-independent apoptosis (PubMed:11463391, PubMed:23340338). Promotes partial unfolding of BCL2L1 and dissociation of BCL2L1 from p53/TP53, releasing the bound p53/TP53 to induce apoptosis (PubMed:23340338). Regulates ER stress-induced neuronal apoptosis (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
