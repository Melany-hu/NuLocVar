EntryName	5MP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	eIF5-mimic protein 2 (Basic leucine zipper and W2 domain-containing protein 1) (Protein Orf)
GeneName	BZW1 5MP2 BZAP45 KIAA0005
Length	419
Function	Translation initiation regulator which represses repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) initiated translation probably by acting as a competitive inhibitor of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (EIF5) function (PubMed:29470543, PubMed:34260931). Enhances histone H4 gene transcription but does not seem to bind DNA directly (PubMed:11524015).
