UniprotID	Q9NSE2
Accession	Q9NSE2;B2R9N1;G5E9R1;Q9NS38;Q9Y5R1
EntryName	CISH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS) (CIS-1) (Protein G18) (Suppressor of cytokine signaling) (SOCS)
GeneName	CISH G18
Length	258
Function	SOCS family proteins form part of a classical negative feedback system that regulates cytokine signal transduction. CIS is involved in the negative regulation of cytokines that signal through the JAK-STAT5 pathway such as erythropoietin, prolactin and interleukin 3 (IL3) receptor. Inhibits STAT5 trans-activation by suppressing its tyrosine phosphorylation. May be a substrate-recognition component of a SCF-like ECS (Elongin BC-CUL2/5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins (By similarity).
