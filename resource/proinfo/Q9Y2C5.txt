EntryName	S17A4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Probable small intestine urate exporter (Solute carrier family 17 member 4)
GeneName	SLC17A4
Length	497
Function	Acts as a membrane potential-dependent organic anion transporter, the transport requires a low concentration of chloride ions (PubMed:22460716). Mediates chloride-dependent transport of urate (PubMed:22460716). Mediates sodium-independent high affinity transport of thyroid hormones including L-thyroxine (T4) and 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) (PubMed:30367059, PubMed:34937426). Can actively transport inorganic phosphate into cells via Na(+) cotransport (PubMed:22460716).
