UniprotID	P05204
Accession	P05204;Q0VGD5;Q6FGI5;Q96C64
EntryName	HMGN2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Non-histone chromosomal protein HMG-17 (High mobility group nucleosome-binding domain-containing protein 2)
GeneName	HMGN2 HMG17
Length	90
Function	Binds to the inner side of the nucleosomal DNA thus altering the interaction between the DNA and the histone octamer. May be involved in the process which maintains transcribable genes in a unique chromatin conformation (By similarity).
