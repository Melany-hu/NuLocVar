UniprotID	Q96MN9
Accession	Q96MN9;Q05CE0
EntryName	ZN488_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger protein 488
GeneName	ZNF488
Length	340
Function	Transcriptional repressor. Plays a role in oligodendrocyte differentiation, together with OLIG2. Mediates Notch signaling-activated formation of oligodendrocyte precursors. Promotes differentiation of adult neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) into mature oligodendrocytes and contributes to remyelination following nerve injury.
