UniprotID	A2RUB6-2
Accession	A2RUB6;B3KWL8;Q4VC34;Q8N949
EntryName	CCD66_HUMAN
ProteinName	Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 66
GeneName	CCDC66
Length	287
Function	Microtubule-binding protein required for ciliogenesis (PubMed:28235840). May function in ciliogenesis by mediating the transport of proteins like BBS4 to the cilium, but also through the organization of the centriolar satellites (PubMed:28235840). Required for the assembly of signaling-competent cilia with proper structure and length (PubMed:36606424). Mediates this function in part by regulating transition zone assembly and basal body recruitment of the IFT-B complex (PubMed:36606424). Cooperates with the ciliopathy proteins CSPP1 and CEP104 during cilium length regulation (PubMed:36606424). Plays two important roles during cell division (PubMed:35849559). First, is required for mitotic progression via regulation of spindle assembly, organization and orientation, levels of spindle microtubules (MTs), kinetochore-fiber integrity, and chromosome alignment (PubMed:35849559). Second, functions during cytokinesis in part by regulating assembly and organization of central spindle and midbody MTs (PubMed:35849559). Plays a role in retina morphogenesis and/or homeostasis (By similarity).
