UniprotID	Q8TF71
Accession	Q8TF71;B3KWY0;Q6ZMG0;Q8WVI5
EntryName	MOT10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Monocarboxylate transporter 10 (MCT 10) (Aromatic amino acid transporter 1) (Solute carrier family 16 member 10) (T-type amino acid transporter 1)
GeneName	SLC16A10 MCT10 TAT1
Length	515
Function	Sodium- and proton-independent thyroid hormones and aromatic acids transporter (PubMed:11827462, PubMed:18337592, PubMed:28754537). Mediates both uptake and efflux of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine (T4) with high affinity, suggesting a role in the homeostasis of thyroid hormone levels (PubMed:18337592). Responsible for low affinity bidirectional transport of the aromatic amino acids, such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan and L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) (PubMed:11827462, PubMed:28754537). Plays an important role in homeostasis of aromatic amino acids (By similarity).
