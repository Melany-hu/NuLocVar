Function	Copper metallochaperone essential for the maturation of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (MT-CO2/COX2). Not required for the synthesis of MT-CO2/COX2 but plays a crucial role in stabilizing MT-CO2/COX2 during its subsequent maturation. Involved in transporting copper to the Cu(A) site on MT-CO2/COX2 (PubMed:15229189, PubMed:15659396, PubMed:16735468, PubMed:17189203, PubMed:19336478). Plays an important role in the regulation of copper homeostasis by controlling the abundance and cell membrane localization of copper transporter CTR1 (By similarity).
