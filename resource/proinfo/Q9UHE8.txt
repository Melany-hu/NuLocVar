UniprotID	Q9UHE8
Accession	Q9UHE8;A4D1E0;O95034
EntryName	STEA1_HUMAN
ProteinName	STEAP1 protein (Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 1)
GeneName	STEAP1 PRSS24 STEAP
Length	339
Function	Does not function as a metalloreductase due to the absence of binding sites for the electron-donating substrate NADPH. Promotes Fe(3+) reduction when fused to the NADPH-binding domain of STEAP4.
Subcellular Location	Endosome membrane; Cell membrane
