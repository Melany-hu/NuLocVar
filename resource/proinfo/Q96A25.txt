UniprotID	Q96A25
Accession	Q96A25;A8K2X2;B7Z698
EntryName	T106A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 106A
GeneName	TMEM106A
Length	262
Function	Activates macrophages and polarizes them into M1-like macrophages through the activation of the MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Upon activation, up-regulates the expression of CD80, CD86, CD69 and MHC II on macrophages, and induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL1B, IL6, CCL2 and nitric oxide (By similarity). May play a role in inhibition of proliferation and migration (PubMed:29131025, PubMed:30456879).
