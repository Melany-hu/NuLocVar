Function	Required for optimal fertilization at the stage of sperm-oocyte fusion, plays a role in optimizing acrosome function, the translocation of IZUMO1 during the acrosome reaction and the fertilization process. Component of epididymosomes, one type of membranous microvesicules which mediate the transfer of lipids and proteins to spermatozoa plasma membrane during epididymal maturation. Also component of the CD9-positive microvesicules found in the cauda region.
