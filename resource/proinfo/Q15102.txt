UniprotID	Q15102
Accession	Q15102;Q53X88
EntryName	PA1B3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase IB subunit alpha1 (EC 3.1.1.47) (PAF acetylhydrolase 29 kDa subunit) (PAF-AH 29 kDa subunit) (PAF-AH subunit gamma) (PAFAH subunit gamma)
GeneName	PAFAH1B3 PAFAHG
Length	231
Function	Alpha1 catalytic subunit of the cytosolic type I platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH (I)) heterotetrameric enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolyze of the acetyl group at the sn-2 position of PAF and its analogs and modulates the action of PAF. The activity and substrate specificity of PAF-AH (I) are affected by its subunit composition. Both alpha1/alpha1 homodimer (PAFAH1B3/PAFAH1B3 homodimer) and alpha1/alpha2 heterodimer(PAFAH1B3/PAFAH1B2 heterodimer) hydrolyze 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid (AAGPA) more efficiently than PAF, but they have little hydrolytic activity towards 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine (AAGPE). Plays an important role during the development of brain.
