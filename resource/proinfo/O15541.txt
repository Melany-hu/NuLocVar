UniprotID	O15541
Accession	O15541;B2RBR7
EntryName	R113A_HUMAN
ProteinName	E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RNF113A (EC 2.3.2.27) (Cwc24 homolog) (RING finger protein 113A) (Zinc finger protein 183)
GeneName	RNF113A RNF113 ZNF183
Length	343
Function	Required for pre-mRNA splicing as component of the spliceosome (PubMed:29360106, PubMed:29361316). As a component of the minor spliceosome, involved in the splicing of U12-type introns in pre-mRNAs (Probable). E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin onto target proteins (PubMed:28978524, PubMed:29144457). Catalyzes polyubiquitination of SNRNP200/BRR2 with non-canonical 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:29144457). Plays a role in DNA repair via its role in the synthesis of 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains that recruit ALKBH3 and the ASCC complex to sites of DNA damage by alkylating agents (PubMed:29144457). Ubiquitinates CXCR4, leading to its degradation, and thereby contributes to the termination of CXCR4 signaling (PubMed:28978524).
