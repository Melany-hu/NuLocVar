UniprotID	Q9NX70
Accession	Q9NX70;B4DNQ6;M0R2E4;Q5XX09;Q9NTF4
EntryName	MED29_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 29 (Intersex-like protein) (Mediator complex subunit 29)
GeneName	MED29 IXL
Length	200
Function	Component of the Mediator complex, a coactivator involved in the regulated transcription of nearly all RNA polymerase II-dependent genes. Mediator functions as a bridge to convey information from gene-specific regulatory proteins to the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. Mediator is recruited to promoters by direct interactions with regulatory proteins and serves as a scaffold for the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex with RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
