ProteinName	Natriuretic peptides B (Brain natriuretic factor prohormone) (preproBNP) (proBNP) (Gamma-brain natriuretic peptide) (Iso-ANP) [Cleaved into: NT-proBNP (NT-pro-BNP) (NT-proBNP(1-76)); proBNP(3-108); Brain natriuretic peptide 32 (BNP(1-32)) (BNP-32) (Brain natriuretic peptide) (BNP); BNP(1-30); BNP(1-29); BNP(1-28); BNP(2-31); BNP(3-32) (des-SerPro-BNP) (proBNP(79-108)); BNP(3-30); BNP(3-29); Brain natriuretic peptide 29 (BNP(4-32)); BNP(4-31); BNP(4-30); BNP(4-29); BNP(4-27); BNP(5-32); BNP(5-31); BNP(5-29)]
GeneName	NPPB
Length	134
Function	Cardiac hormone that plays a key role in mediating cardio-renal homeostasis (PubMed:1672777, PubMed:17372040, PubMed:1914098, PubMed:9458824). May also function as a paracrine antifibrotic factor in the heart (By similarity). Acts by specifically binding and stimulating NPR1 to produce cGMP, which in turn activates effector proteins that drive various biological responses (PubMed:1672777, PubMed:17349887, PubMed:17372040, PubMed:21098034, PubMed:25339504, PubMed:9458824). Involved in regulating the extracellular fluid volume and maintaining the fluid-electrolyte balance through natriuresis, diuresis, vasorelaxation, and inhibition of renin and aldosterone secretion (PubMed:1914098, PubMed:9458824). Binds the clearance receptor NPR3 (PubMed:16870210).
