UniprotID	O15537
Accession	O15537;Q0QD39
EntryName	XLRS1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinoschisin (X-linked juvenile retinoschisis protein)
GeneName	RS1 XLRS1
Length	224
Function	Binds negatively charged membrane lipids, such as phosphatidylserine and phosphoinositides (By similarity). May play a role in cell-cell adhesion processes in the retina, via homomeric interaction between octamers present on the surface of two neighboring cells (PubMed:27114531). Required for normal structure and function of the retina (PubMed:19093009).
Subcellular Location	Secreted; Cell membrane
