UniprotID	Q8IYX4
Accession	Q8IYX4
EntryName	DND1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dead end protein homolog 1 (RNA-binding motif, single-stranded-interacting protein 4)
GeneName	DND1 RBMS4
Length	353
Function	RNA-binding factor that positively regulates gene expression by prohibiting miRNA-mediated gene suppression. Relieves miRNA repression in germline cells (By similarity). Prohibits the function of several miRNAs by blocking the accessibility of target mRNAs. Sequence-specific RNA-binding factor that binds specifically to U-rich regions (URRs) in the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of several mRNAs. Does not bind to miRNAs. May play a role during primordial germ cell (PGC) survival (By similarity). However, does not seem to be essential for PGC migration (By similarity).
