UniprotID	Q15819
Accession	Q15819
EntryName	UB2V2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 2 (DDVit 1) (Enterocyte differentiation-associated factor 1) (EDAF-1) (Enterocyte differentiation-promoting factor 1) (EDPF-1) (MMS2 homolog) (Vitamin D3-inducible protein)
GeneName	UBE2V2 MMS2 UEV2
Length	145
Function	Has no ubiquitin ligase activity on its own. The UBE2V2/UBE2N heterodimer catalyzes the synthesis of non-canonical poly-ubiquitin chains that are linked through 'Lys-63'. This type of poly-ubiquitination does not lead to protein degradation by the proteasome. Mediates transcriptional activation of target genes. Plays a role in the control of progress through the cell cycle and differentiation. Plays a role in the error-free DNA repair pathway and contributes to the survival of cells after DNA damage.
