UniprotID	D3W0D1
Accession	D3W0D1
EntryName	KLRF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily F member 2 (Lectin-like receptor F2) (Activating coreceptor NKp65)
GeneName	KLRF2
Length	207
Function	C-type lectin-like receptor involved in natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion in keratinocytes via its interaction with CLEC2A (PubMed:20194751, PubMed:25510854). Triggers degranulation in a SYK-dependent manner and stimulates SYK phosphotyrosinylation without recruiting SYK directly (PubMed:28082678).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
