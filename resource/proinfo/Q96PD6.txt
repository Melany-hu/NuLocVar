UniprotID	Q96PD6
Accession	Q96PD6;Q6IEE5
EntryName	MOGT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	2-acylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (EC 2.3.1.22) (Acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 1) (MGAT1) (Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase candidate 2) (hDC2) (Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2-like protein 1) (Monoacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1)
GeneName	MOGAT1 DC2 DGAT2L1
Length	335
Function	Involved in glycerolipid synthesis and lipid metabolism. Catalyzes the formation of diacylglycerol, the precursor of triacylglycerol, by transferring the acyl chain of a fatty acyl-CoA to a monoacylglycerol, mainly at the sn-1 or sn-3 positions. It uses both sn-2-monoacylglycerol (2-acylglycerol) and sn-1-monoacylglycerol (1-acyl-sn-glycerol) equally well as substrates, and uses sn-3-monoacylglycerol (3-acyl-sn-glycerol) with lower efficiency. Probably not involved in absorption of dietary fat in the small intestine.
