EntryName	TCF7_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcription factor 7 (TCF-7) (T-cell-specific transcription factor 1) (T-cell factor 1) (TCF-1)
GeneName	TCF7 TCF1
Length	384
Function	Transcriptional activator involved in T-cell lymphocyte differentiation. Necessary for the survival of CD4(+) CD8(+) immature thymocytes. Isoforms lacking the N-terminal CTNNB1 binding domain cannot fulfill this role. Binds to the T-lymphocyte-specific enhancer element (5'-WWCAAAG-3') found in the promoter of the CD3E gene. Represses expression of the T-cell receptor gamma gene in alpha-beta T-cell lineages (By similarity). Required for the development of natural killer receptor-positive lymphoid tissue inducer T-cells (By similarity). TLE1, TLE2, TLE3 and TLE4 repress transactivation mediated by TCF7 and CTNNB1. May also act as feedback transcriptional repressor of CTNNB1 and TCF7L2 target genes.
