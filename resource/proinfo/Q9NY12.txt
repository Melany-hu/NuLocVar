UniprotID	Q9NY12
Accession	Q9NY12;Q5MJQ2
EntryName	GAR1_HUMAN
ProteinName	H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex subunit 1 (Nucleolar protein family A member 1) (snoRNP protein GAR1)
GeneName	GAR1 NOLA1
Length	217
Function	Required for ribosome biogenesis and telomere maintenance. Part of the H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (H/ACA snoRNP) complex, which catalyzes pseudouridylation of rRNA. This involves the isomerization of uridine such that the ribose is subsequently attached to C5, instead of the normal N1. Each rRNA can contain up to 100 pseudouridine ('psi') residues, which may serve to stabilize the conformation of rRNAs. May also be required for correct processing or intranuclear trafficking of TERC, the RNA component of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) holoenzyme.
