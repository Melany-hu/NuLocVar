UniprotID	Q8IW03
Accession	Q8IW03;B7ZBP0;Q8N8M6
EntryName	SIAH3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Seven in absentia homolog 3 (Siah-3)
GeneName	SIAH3
Length	269
Function	Negative regulator of PRKN translocation to damaged mitochondria. Acts probably by destabilizing PINK1 protein, hence inhibiting PRKN targeting to dysfunctional depolarized mitochondria.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
