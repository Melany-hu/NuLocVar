UniprotID	Q86W47
Accession	Q86W47;Q8IVR3;Q9NPA4;Q9P0G5
EntryName	KCMB4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Calcium-activated potassium channel subunit beta-4 (BK channel subunit beta-4) (BKbeta4) (Hbeta4) (Calcium-activated potassium channel, subfamily M subunit beta-4) (Charybdotoxin receptor subunit beta-4) (K(VCA)beta-4) (Maxi K channel subunit beta-4) (Slo-beta-4)
GeneName	KCNMB4
Length	210
Function	Regulatory subunit of the calcium activated potassium KCNMA1 (maxiK) channel. Modulates the calcium sensitivity and gating kinetics of KCNMA1, thereby contributing to KCNMA1 channel diversity. Decreases the gating kinetics and calcium sensitivity of the KCNMA1 channel, but with fast deactivation kinetics. May decrease KCNMA1 channel openings at low calcium concentrations but increases channel openings at high calcium concentrations. Makes KCNMA1 channel resistant to 100 nM charybdotoxin (CTX) toxin concentrations.
Subcellular Location	Membrane
