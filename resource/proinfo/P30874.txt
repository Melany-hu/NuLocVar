UniprotID	P30874
Accession	P30874;A8K3Y0;B2R9P7;Q4VBP0;Q96GE0;Q96TF2;Q9BWH1
EntryName	SSR2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Somatostatin receptor type 2 (SS-2-R) (SS2-R) (SS2R) (SST2) (SRIF-1)
GeneName	SSTR2
Length	369
Function	Receptor for somatostatin-14 and -28. This receptor is coupled via pertussis toxin sensitive G proteins to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. In addition it stimulates phosphotyrosine phosphatase and PLC via pertussis toxin insensitive as well as sensitive G proteins. Inhibits calcium entry by suppressing voltage-dependent calcium channels. Acts as the functionally dominant somatostatin receptor in pancreatic alpha- and beta-cells where it mediates the inhibitory effect of somatostatin-14 on hormone secretion. Inhibits cell growth through enhancement of MAPK1 and MAPK2 phosphorylation and subsequent up-regulation of CDKN1B. Stimulates neuronal migration and axon outgrowth and may participate in neuron development and maturation during brain development. Mediates negative regulation of insulin receptor signaling through PTPN6. Inactivates SSTR3 receptor function following heterodimerization.
