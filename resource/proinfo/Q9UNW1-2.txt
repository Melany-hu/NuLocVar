EntryName	MINP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 1 (EC 3.1.3.62) (2,3-bisphosphoglycerate 3-phosphatase) (2,3-BPG phosphatase) (EC 3.1.3.80)
GeneName	MINPP1 MIPP UNQ900/PRO1917
Length	312
Function	Multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase that hydrolyzes 1D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (InsP5) and 1D-myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) to a range of less phosphorylated inositol phosphates. This regulates the availability of these various small molecule second messengers and metal chelators which control many aspects of cell physiology (PubMed:33257696, PubMed:36589890). Has a weak in vitro activity towards 1D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate which is unlikely to be physiologically relevant (PubMed:36589890). By regulating intracellular inositol polyphosphates pools, which act as metal chelators, it may control the availability of intracellular calcium and iron, which are important for proper neuronal development and homeostasis (PubMed:33257696). May have a dual substrate specificity, and function as a 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate 3-phosphatase hydrolyzing 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate. 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) is formed as part of the Rapoport-Luebering glycolytic bypass and is a regulator of systemic oxygen homeostasis as the major allosteric effector of hemoglobin (PubMed:18413611).
