UniprotID	O96011
Accession	O96011;B3KN85;B4DXH9;Q96ET2
EntryName	PX11B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Peroxisomal membrane protein 11B (Peroxin-11B) (Peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11B) (Protein PEX11 homolog beta) (PEX11-beta)
GeneName	PEX11B
Length	259
Function	Involved in peroxisomal proliferation (PubMed:9792670). May regulate peroxisome division by recruiting the dynamin-related GTPase DNM1L to the peroxisomal membrane (PubMed:12618434). Promotes membrane protrusion and elongation on the peroxisomal surface (PubMed:20826455).
Subcellular Location	Peroxisome membrane
