EntryName	TEAD4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transcriptional enhancer factor TEF-3 (TEA domain family member 4) (TEAD-4) (Transcription factor 13-like 1) (Transcription factor RTEF-1)
GeneName	TEAD4 RTEF1 TCF13L1 TEF3
Length	434
Function	Transcription factor which plays a key role in the Hippo signaling pathway, a pathway involved in organ size control and tumor suppression by restricting proliferation and promoting apoptosis. The core of this pathway is composed of a kinase cascade wherein MST1/MST2, in complex with its regulatory protein SAV1, phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2 in complex with its regulatory protein MOB1, which in turn phosphorylates and inactivates YAP1 oncoprotein and WWTR1/TAZ. Acts by mediating gene expression of YAP1 and WWTR1/TAZ, thereby regulating cell proliferation, migration and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction. Binds specifically and non-cooperatively to the Sph and GT-IIC 'enhansons' (5'-GTGGAATGT-3') and activates transcription. Binds to the M-CAT motif.
