UniprotID	Q9NWF4
Accession	Q9NWF4;B5MEV1;B5MEV2;Q6P9E0;Q86UT0
EntryName	S52A1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Solute carrier family 52, riboflavin transporter, member 1 (Porcine endogenous retrovirus A receptor 2) (PERV-A receptor 2) (huPAR-2) (Protein GPR172B) (Riboflavin transporter 1) (hRFT1)
GeneName	SLC52A1 GPR172B PAR2 RFT1
Length	448
Function	Plasma membrane transporter mediating the uptake by cells of the water soluble vitamin B2/riboflavin that plays a key role in biochemical oxidation-reduction reactions of the carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism (PubMed:18632736, PubMed:20463145). Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin B2/riboflavin and must obtain it via intestinal absorption (PubMed:20463145).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
