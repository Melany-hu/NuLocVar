EntryName	ZC3HE_HUMAN
ProteinName	Zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 14 (Mammalian suppressor of tau pathology-2) (MSUT-2) (Renal carcinoma antigen NY-REN-37)
GeneName	ZC3H14
Length	306
Function	RNA-binding protein involved in the biogenesis of circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are produced by back-splicing circularization of pre-mRNAs (PubMed:39461343). Acts by binding to both exon-intron boundary and 3'-UTR of pre-mRNAs to promote circRNA biogenesis through dimerization and the association with the spliceosome (PubMed:39461343). Required for spermatogenesis via involvement in circRNA biogenesis (PubMed:39461343). Regulates the pre-mRNA processing of ATP5MC1; preventing its degradation (PubMed:27563065). Also binds the poly(A) tail of mRNAs; controlling poly(A) length in neuronal cells (PubMed:17630287, PubMed:24671764).
