EntryName	ZDHC5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5 (EC 2.3.1.225) (Zinc finger DHHC domain-containing protein 5) (DHHC-5) (Zinc finger protein 375)
GeneName	ZDHHC5 KIAA1748 ZNF375
Length	715
Function	Palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of palmitate onto various protein substrates such as CTNND2, CD36, GSDMD, NLRP3, NOD1, NOD2, STAT3 and S1PR1 thus plays a role in various biological processes including cell adhesion, inflammation, fatty acid uptake, bacterial sensing or cardiac functions (PubMed:21820437, PubMed:29185452, PubMed:31402609, PubMed:31649195, PubMed:34293401, PubMed:38092000, PubMed:38530158, PubMed:38599239). Plays an important role in the regulation of synapse efficacy by mediating palmitoylation of delta-catenin/CTNND2, thereby increasing synaptic delivery and surface stabilization of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) (PubMed:26334723). Under basal conditions, remains at the synaptic membrane through FYN-mediated phosphorylation that prevents association with endocytic proteins (PubMed:26334723). Neuronal activity enhances the internalization and trafficking of DHHC5 from spines to dendritic shafts where it palmitoylates delta-catenin/CTNND2 (PubMed:26334723). Regulates cell adhesion at the plasma membrane by palmitoylating GOLGA7B and DSG2 (PubMed:31402609). Plays a role in innate immune response by mediating the palmitoylation of NOD1 and NOD2 and their proper recruitment to the bacterial entry site and phagosomes (PubMed:31649195, PubMed:34293401). Also participates in fatty acid uptake by palmitoylating CD36 and thereby targeting it to the plasma membrane (PubMed:32958780). Upon binding of fatty acids to CD36, gets phosphorylated by LYN leading to inactivation and subsequent CD36 caveolar endocytosis (PubMed:32958780). Controls oligodendrocyte development by catalyzing STAT3 palmitoylation (By similarity). Acts as a regulator of inflammatory response by mediating palmitoylation of NLRP3 and GSDMD (PubMed:38092000, PubMed:38530158, PubMed:38599239). Palmitoylates NLRP3 to promote inflammasome assembly and activation (PubMed:38092000). Activates pyroptosis by catalyzing palmitoylation of gasdermin-D (GSDMD), thereby promoting membrane translocation and pore formation of GSDMD (PubMed:38530158, PubMed:38599239).
