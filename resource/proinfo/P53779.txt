UniprotID	P53779
Accession	P53779;A6NFS3;A6NG28;B3KQ94;Q15707;Q49AP1
EntryName	MK10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitogen-activated protein kinase 10 (MAP kinase 10) (MAPK 10) (EC 2.7.11.24) (MAP kinase p49 3F12) (Stress-activated protein kinase 1b) (SAPK1b) (Stress-activated protein kinase JNK3) (c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3)
GeneName	MAPK10 JNK3 JNK3A PRKM10 SAPK1B
Length	464
Function	Serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in various processes such as neuronal proliferation, differentiation, migration and programmed cell death. Extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK10/JNK3. In turn, MAPK10/JNK3 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity. Plays regulatory roles in the signaling pathways during neuronal apoptosis. Phosphorylates the neuronal microtubule regulator STMN2. Acts in the regulation of the amyloid-beta precursor protein/APP signaling during neuronal differentiation by phosphorylating APP. Also participates in neurite growth in spiral ganglion neurons. Phosphorylates the CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer and plays a role in the photic regulation of the circadian clock (PubMed:22441692). Phosphorylates JUND and this phosphorylation is inhibited in the presence of MEN1 (PubMed:22327296).
