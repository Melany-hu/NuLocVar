UniprotID	Q8WWY8
Accession	Q8WWY8;A2IBA7;Q8TEC7
EntryName	LIPH_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lipase member H (LIPH) (EC 3.1.1.-) (LPD lipase-related protein) (Membrane-associated phosphatidic acid-selective phospholipase A1-alpha) (mPA-PLA1 alpha) (Phospholipase A1 member B)
GeneName	LIPH LPDLR MPAPLA1 PLA1B
Length	451
Function	Hydrolyzes specifically phosphatidic acid (PA) to produce 2-acyl lysophosphatidic acid (LPA; a potent bioactive lipid mediator) and fatty acid. Does not hydrolyze other phospholipids, like phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or triacylglycerol (TG).
