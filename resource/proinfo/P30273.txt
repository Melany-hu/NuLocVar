UniprotID	P30273
Accession	P30273;Q5VTW4
EntryName	FCERG_HUMAN
ProteinName	High affinity immunoglobulin epsilon receptor subunit gamma (Fc receptor gamma-chain) (FcRgamma) (Fc-epsilon RI-gamma) (IgE Fc receptor subunit gamma) (FceRI gamma)
GeneName	FCER1G
Length	86
Function	Adapter protein containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that transduces activation signals from various immunoreceptors. As a component of the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor, mediates allergic inflammatory signaling in mast cells. As a constitutive component of interleukin-3 receptor complex, selectively mediates interleukin 4/IL4 production by basophils, priming T-cells toward effector T-helper 2 subset. Associates with pattern recognition receptors CLEC4D and CLEC4E to form a functional signaling complex in myeloid cells. Binding of mycobacterial trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate (TDM) to this receptor complex leads to phosphorylation of ITAM, triggering activation of SYK, CARD9 and NF-kappa-B, consequently driving maturation of antigen-presenting cells and shaping antigen-specific priming of T-cells toward effector T-helper 1 and T-helper 17 cell subtypes. May function cooperatively with other activating receptors. Functionally linked to integrin beta-2/ITGB2-mediated neutrophil activation. Also involved in integrin alpha-2/ITGA2-mediated platelet activation.
