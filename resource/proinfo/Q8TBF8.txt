UniprotID	Q8TBF8
Accession	Q8TBF8
EntryName	FA81A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein FAM81A
GeneName	FAM81A
Length	368
Function	Facilitates the interaction and assembly of proteins within the postsynaptic density by promoting the condensation of postsynaptic proteins via liquid-liquid phase separation. Required for neuronal activity. Accumulation at the postsynaptic density results in enlargement of dendritic spines.
Subcellular Location	Postsynaptic density; Cytoplasm
