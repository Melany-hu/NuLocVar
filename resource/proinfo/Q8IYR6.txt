UniprotID	Q8IYR6
Accession	Q8IYR6;Q13086;Q8N3T8
EntryName	TEFF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tomoregulin-1 (TR-1) (H7365) (Transmembrane protein with EGF-like and one follistatin-like domain)
GeneName	TMEFF1 C9orf2
Length	380
Function	Neuron-specific restriction factor that prevents herpes simplex virus 1 (HHV-1) infection in the brain by blocking viral entry (PubMed:39048823, PubMed:39048830). Also able to restrict herpes simplex virus 2 (HHV-2) infection, although to a lesser extent (PubMed:39048823). Acts by preventing the association between the viral glycoprotein D (gD) and its cell surface receptor NECTIN1, thereby inhibiting fusion of the virus and the cell membrane (PubMed:39048823, PubMed:39048830). Also able to prevent the association between the viral glycoprotein B (gB) and MYH9/NMMHC-IIA and MYH10/NMMHC-IIB receptors (PubMed:39048823). May be a tumor suppressor in brain cancers (PubMed:12743596).
