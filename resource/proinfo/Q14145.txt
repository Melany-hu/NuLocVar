EntryName	KEAP1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Cytosolic inhibitor of Nrf2) (INrf2) (Kelch-like protein 19)
GeneName	KEAP1 INRF2 KIAA0132 KLHL19
Length	624
Function	Substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates the response to oxidative stress by targeting NFE2L2/NRF2 for ubiquitination (PubMed:14585973, PubMed:15379550, PubMed:15572695, PubMed:15601839, PubMed:15983046, PubMed:37339955). KEAP1 acts as a key sensor of oxidative and electrophilic stress: in normal conditions, the BCR(KEAP1) complex mediates ubiquitination and degradation of NFE2L2/NRF2, a transcription factor regulating expression of many cytoprotective genes (PubMed:15601839, PubMed:16006525). In response to oxidative stress, different electrophile metabolites trigger non-enzymatic covalent modifications of highly reactive cysteine residues in KEAP1, leading to inactivate the ubiquitin ligase activity of the BCR(KEAP1) complex, promoting NFE2L2/NRF2 nuclear accumulation and expression of phase II detoxifying enzymes (PubMed:16006525, PubMed:17127771, PubMed:18251510, PubMed:19489739, PubMed:29590092). In response to selective autophagy, KEAP1 is sequestered in inclusion bodies following its interaction with SQSTM1/p62, leading to inactivation of the BCR(KEAP1) complex and activation of NFE2L2/NRF2 (PubMed:20452972). The BCR(KEAP1) complex also mediates ubiquitination of SQSTM1/p62, increasing SQSTM1/p62 sequestering activity and degradation (PubMed:28380357). The BCR(KEAP1) complex also targets BPTF and PGAM5 for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (PubMed:15379550, PubMed:17046835).
