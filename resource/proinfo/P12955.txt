EntryName	PEPD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Xaa-Pro dipeptidase (X-Pro dipeptidase) (EC 3.4.13.9) (Imidodipeptidase) (Peptidase D) (Proline dipeptidase) (Prolidase)
GeneName	PEPD PRD
Length	493
Function	Dipeptidase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of dipeptides with a prolyl (Xaa-Pro) or hydroxyprolyl residue in the C-terminal position (PubMed:17081196, PubMed:35165443). The preferred dipeptide substrate is Gly-Pro, but other Xaa-Pro dipeptides, such as Ala-Pro, Met-Pro, Phe-Pro, Val-Pro and Leu-Pro, can be cleaved (PubMed:17081196). Plays an important role in collagen metabolism because the high level of iminoacids in collagen (PubMed:2925654).
