UniprotID	Q9H1Z9
Accession	Q9H1Z9;Q8N548
EntryName	TSN10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Tetraspanin-10 (Tspan-10) (Oculospanin)
GeneName	TSPAN10 OCSP
Length	355
Function	Part of TspanC8 subgroup, composed of 6 members that interact with the transmembrane metalloprotease ADAM10. This interaction is required for ADAM10 exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and for enzymatic maturation and trafficking to the cell surface as well as substrate specificity. Different TspanC8/ADAM10 complexes have distinct substrates.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
