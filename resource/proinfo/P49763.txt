UniprotID	P49763
Accession	P49763;Q07101;Q9BV78;Q9Y6S8
EntryName	PLGF_HUMAN
ProteinName	Placenta growth factor (PlGF)
GeneName	PGF PGFL PLGF
Length	221
Function	Growth factor active in angiogenesis and endothelial cell growth, stimulating their proliferation and migration. It binds to the receptor FLT1/VEGFR-1. Isoform PlGF-2 binds NRP1/neuropilin-1 and NRP2/neuropilin-2 in a heparin-dependent manner. Also promotes cell tumor growth.
