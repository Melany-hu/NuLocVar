UniprotID	Q96BI3
Accession	Q96BI3;B4DQK0;Q5TB22;Q5TB23;Q969R6;Q9BVG0;Q9Y386
EntryName	APH1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Gamma-secretase subunit APH-1A (APH-1a) (Aph-1alpha) (Presenilin-stabilization factor)
GeneName	APH1A PSF CGI-78 UNQ579/PRO1141
Length	265
Function	Non-catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, an endoprotease complex that catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of integral membrane proteins such as Notch receptors and APP (amyloid-beta precursor protein) (PubMed:12297508, PubMed:12522139, PubMed:12679784, PubMed:12763021, PubMed:25043039, PubMed:26280335, PubMed:30598546, PubMed:30630874). Required for normal gamma-secretase assembly (PubMed:12471034, PubMed:12522139, PubMed:12763021, PubMed:19369254). The gamma-secretase complex plays a role in Notch and Wnt signaling cascades and regulation of downstream processes via its role in processing key regulatory proteins, and by regulating cytosolic CTNNB1 levels (Probable).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Golgi apparatus; Golgi stack membrane
