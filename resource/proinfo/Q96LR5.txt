UniprotID	Q96LR5
Accession	Q96LR5
EntryName	UB2E2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E2 (EC 2.3.2.23) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2) (UbcH8) (Ubiquitin carrier protein E2) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase E2)
GeneName	UBE2E2 UBCH8
Length	201
Function	Accepts ubiquitin from the E1 complex and catalyzes its covalent attachment to other proteins. In vitro catalyzes 'Lys-11'- and 'Lys-48'-, as well as 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination. Catalyzes the ISGylation of influenza A virus NS1 protein.
