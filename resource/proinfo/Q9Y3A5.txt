UniprotID	Q9Y3A5
Accession	Q9Y3A5;A8K0P4;Q96FX0;Q9NV53
EntryName	SBDS_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribosome maturation protein SBDS (Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome protein)
GeneName	SBDS CGI-97
Length	250
Function	Required for the assembly of mature ribosomes and ribosome biogenesis. Together with EFL1, triggers the GTP-dependent release of EIF6 from 60S pre-ribosomes in the cytoplasm, thereby activating ribosomes for translation competence by allowing 80S ribosome assembly and facilitating EIF6 recycling to the nucleus, where it is required for 60S rRNA processing and nuclear export. Required for normal levels of protein synthesis. May play a role in cellular stress resistance. May play a role in cellular response to DNA damage. May play a role in cell proliferation.
