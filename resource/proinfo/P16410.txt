UniprotID	P16410
Accession	P16410;A0N1S0;E9PDH0;O95653;Q0PP65;Q52MC1;Q53TD5;Q5S005;Q8WXJ1;Q96P43;Q9UKN9
EntryName	CTLA4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4 (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4) (CTLA-4) (CD antigen CD152)
GeneName	CTLA4 CD152
Length	223
Function	Inhibitory receptor acting as a major negative regulator of T-cell responses. The affinity of CTLA4 for its natural B7 family ligands, CD80 and CD86, is considerably stronger than the affinity of their cognate stimulatory coreceptor CD28.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
