UniprotID	Q9NVV0
Accession	Q9NVV0;Q5JR63;Q5SVN5;Q5SVN6;Q5VTE2;Q6IA97
EntryName	TM38B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Trimeric intracellular cation channel type B (TRIC-B) (TRICB) (Transmembrane protein 38B)
GeneName	TMEM38B C9orf87 TRICB
Length	291
Function	Intracellular monovalent cation channel required for maintenance of rapid intracellular calcium release. Acts as a potassium counter-ion channel that functions in synchronization with calcium release from intracellular stores (By similarity). Activated by increased cytosolic Ca(2+) levels (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
