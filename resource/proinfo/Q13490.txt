UniprotID	Q13490
Accession	Q13490;B4E026;Q16516;Q4TTG0
EntryName	BIRC2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 2 (EC 2.3.2.27) (Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1) (C-IAP1) (IAP homolog B) (Inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2) (hIAP-2) (hIAP2) (RING finger protein 48) (RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase BIRC2) (TNFR2-TRAF-signaling complex protein 2)
GeneName	BIRC2 API1 MIHB RNF48
Length	618
Function	Multi-functional protein which regulates not only caspases and apoptosis, but also modulates inflammatory signaling and immunity, mitogenic kinase signaling, and cell proliferation, as well as cell invasion and metastasis. Acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase regulating NF-kappa-B signaling and regulates both canonical and non-canonical NF-kappa-B signaling by acting in opposite directions: acts as a positive regulator of the canonical pathway and suppresses constitutive activation of non-canonical NF-kappa-B signaling. The target proteins for its E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity include: RIPK1, RIPK2, RIPK3, RIPK4, CASP3, CASP7, CASP8, TRAF2, DIABLO/SMAC, MAP3K14/NIK, MAP3K5/ASK1, IKBKG/NEMO, IKBKE and MXD1/MAD1. Can also function as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway, targeting effector caspases for neddylation and inactivation. Acts as an important regulator of innate immune signaling via regulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Nodlike receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I like receptors (RLRs), collectively referred to as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Protects cells from spontaneous formation of the ripoptosome, a large multi-protein complex that has the capability to kill cancer cells in a caspase-dependent and caspase-independent manner. Suppresses ripoptosome formation by ubiquitinating RIPK1 and CASP8. Can stimulate the transcriptional activity of E2F1. Plays a role in the modulation of the cell cycle.
