UniprotID	P52797
Accession	P52797;B7ZAD3;D3DV85;Q0VGC9;Q5SR70
EntryName	EFNA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ephrin-A3 (EFL-2) (EHK1 ligand) (EHK1-L) (EPH-related receptor tyrosine kinase ligand 3) (LERK-3)
GeneName	EFNA3 EFL2 EPLG3 LERK3
Length	238
Function	Cell surface GPI-bound ligand for Eph receptors, a family of receptor tyrosine kinases which are crucial for migration, repulsion and adhesion during neuronal, vascular and epithelial development. Binds promiscuously Eph receptors residing on adjacent cells, leading to contact-dependent bidirectional signaling into neighboring cells. The signaling pathway downstream of the receptor is referred to as forward signaling while the signaling pathway downstream of the ephrin ligand is referred to as reverse signaling (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
