EntryName	ST1C4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sulfotransferase 1C4 (ST1C4) (EC 2.8.2.1) (Sulfotransferase 1C2) (SULT1C#2)
GeneName	SULT1C4 SULT1C2
Length	302
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) as sulfonate donor to catalyze the sulfate conjugation of phenolic compounds. Can also sulfonate estrogenic compounds, however, the dietary flavonoids (phytoestrogen) and environmental estrogens, like bisphenol A are better substrates than 17beta-estradiol (E2) (PubMed:17425406, PubMed:26948952, PubMed:28222028, PubMed:9852044). Mediates the sulfation of doxorubicin and its analog epirubicin, two antitumor anthracyclines (PubMed:26948952).
