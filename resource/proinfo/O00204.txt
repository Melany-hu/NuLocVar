EntryName	ST2B1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Sulfotransferase 2B1 (EC 2.8.2.2) (Alcohol sulfotransferase) (Hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase 2) (Sulfotransferase family 2B member 1) (Sulfotransferase family cytosolic 2B member 1) (ST2B1)
GeneName	SULT2B1 HSST2
Length	365
Function	Sulfotransferase that utilizes 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate (PAPS) as sulfonate donor to catalyze the sulfate conjugation. Responsible for the sulfation of cholesterol (PubMed:12145317, PubMed:19589875). Catalyzes sulfation of the 3beta-hydroxyl groups of steroids, such as, pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (PubMed:12145317, PubMed:16855051, PubMed:21855633, PubMed:9799594). Preferentially sulfonates cholesterol, while it also has significant activity with pregnenolone and DHEA (PubMed:12145317, PubMed:21855633). Plays a role in epidermal cholesterol metabolism and in the regulation of epidermal proliferation and differentiation (PubMed:28575648).
