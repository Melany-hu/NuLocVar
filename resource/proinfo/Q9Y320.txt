UniprotID	Q9Y320
Accession	Q9Y320;B7Z4R4;Q53G73;Q561W0;Q5J7Q7;Q8NBP9;Q9H3L1
EntryName	TMX2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 2 (Cell proliferation-inducing gene 26 protein) (Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 14)
GeneName	TMX2 TXNDC14 CGI-31 My009 PIG26 PSEC0045 UNQ237/PRO270
Length	296
Function	Endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-associated protein that probably functions as a regulator of cellular redox state and thereby regulates protein post-translational modification, protein folding and mitochondrial activity. Indirectly regulates neuronal proliferation, migration, and organization in the developing brain.
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane; Mitochondrion membrane
