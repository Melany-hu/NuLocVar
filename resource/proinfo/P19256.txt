UniprotID	P19256
Accession	P19256;A8K7G5;Q5U053;Q6IB65;Q96KI9
EntryName	LFA3_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (Ag3) (Surface glycoprotein LFA-3) (CD antigen CD58)
GeneName	CD58 LFA3
Length	250
Function	Ligand of the T-lymphocyte CD2 glycoprotein. This interaction is important in mediating thymocyte interactions with thymic epithelial cells, antigen-independent and -dependent interactions of T-lymphocytes with target cells and antigen-presenting cells and the T-lymphocyte rosetting with erythrocytes. In addition, the LFA-3/CD2 interaction may prime response by both the CD2+ and LFA-3+ cells.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
