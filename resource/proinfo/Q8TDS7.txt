UniprotID	Q8TDS7
Accession	Q8TDS7;Q8NGK7
EntryName	MRGRD_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor member D (Beta-alanine receptor) (G-protein coupled receptor TGR7)
GeneName	MRGPRD MRGD
Length	321
Function	May regulate nociceptor function and/or development, including the sensation or modulation of pain. Functions as a specific membrane receptor for beta-alanine. Beta-alanine at micromolar doses specifically evoked Ca(2+) influx in cells expressing the receptor. Beta-alanine decreases forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in cells expressing the receptor, suggesting that the receptor couples with G-protein G(q) and G(i).
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane
