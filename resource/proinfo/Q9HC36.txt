UniprotID	Q9HC36
Accession	Q9HC36;Q53GN1;Q86VC3;Q96F76;Q9NVQ5
EntryName	MRM3_HUMAN
ProteinName	rRNA methyltransferase 3, mitochondrial (EC 2.1.1.-) (16S rRNA (guanosine(1370)-2'-O)-methyltransferase) (16S rRNA [Gm1370] 2'-O-methyltransferase) (RNA methyltransferase-like protein 1)
GeneName	MRM3 RNMTL1 HC90
Length	420
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of 2'-O-methylguanosine at position 1370 (Gm1370) in the 16S mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSU rRNA), a conserved modification in the peptidyl transferase domain of the mtLSU rRNA (PubMed:24036117, PubMed:25009282, PubMed:25074936, PubMed:35177605). Also required for formation of 2'-O-methyluridine at position 1369 (Um1369) mediated by MRM2 (PubMed:35177605).
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
