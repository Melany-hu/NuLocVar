UniprotID	P10619
Accession	P10619;B2R798;Q561W6;Q5JZH1;Q96KJ2;Q9BR08;Q9BW68
EntryName	PPGB_HUMAN
ProteinName	Lysosomal protective protein (EC 3.4.16.5) (Carboxypeptidase C) (Carboxypeptidase L) (Cathepsin A) (Protective protein cathepsin A) (PPCA) (Protective protein for beta-galactosidase) [Cleaved into: Lysosomal protective protein 32 kDa chain; Lysosomal protective protein 20 kDa chain]
GeneName	CTSA PPGB
Length	480
Function	Protective protein appears to be essential for both the activity of beta-galactosidase and neuraminidase, it associates with these enzymes and exerts a protective function necessary for their stability and activity. This protein is also a carboxypeptidase and can deamidate tachykinins.
Subcellular Location	Lysosome
