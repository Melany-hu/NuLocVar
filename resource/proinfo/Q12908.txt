UniprotID	Q12908
Accession	Q12908;A1L4F4;Q13839
EntryName	NTCP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ileal sodium/bile acid cotransporter (Apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter) (ASBT) (Ileal Na(+)/bile acid cotransporter) (Ileal sodium-dependent bile acid transporter) (IBAT) (ISBT) (Na(+)-dependent ileal bile acid transporter) (Sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, ileal) (Solute carrier family 10 member 2)
GeneName	SLC10A2 ASBT ISBT NTCP2
Length	348
Function	Plays a critical role in the sodium-dependent reabsorption of bile acids from the lumen of the small intestine (PubMed:7592981, PubMed:9458785, PubMed:9856990). Transports various bile acids, unconjugated or conjugated, such as cholate and taurocholate (PubMed:7592981, PubMed:9458785, PubMed:9856990). Also responsible for bile acid transport in the renal proximal tubules, a salvage mechanism that helps conserve bile acids (Probable). Works collaboratively with the Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), the organic solute transporter (OST), and the bile salt export pump (BSEP), to ensure efficacious biological recycling of bile acids during enterohepatic circulation (PubMed:33222321).
