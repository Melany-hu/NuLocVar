UniprotID	Q96N28
Accession	Q96N28;B0YJ10;B4E0C9;D3DUJ1;Q6AHX2
EntryName	PLD3A_HUMAN
ProteinName	PRELI domain containing protein 3A (Protein slowmo homolog 1)
GeneName	PRELID3A C18orf43 SLMO1
Length	172
Function	In vitro, the TRIAP1:PRELID3A complex mediates the transfer of phosphatidic acid (PA) between liposomes and probably functions as a PA transporter across the mitochondrion intermembrane space. Phosphatidic acid import is required for cardiolipin (CL) synthesis in the mitochondrial inner membrane.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion
