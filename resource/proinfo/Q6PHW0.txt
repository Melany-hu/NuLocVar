EntryName	IYD1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Iodotyrosine deiodinase 1 (IYD-1) (EC 1.21.1.1) (Iodotyrosine dehalogenase 1)
GeneName	IYD C6orf71 DEHAL1
Length	289
Function	Catalyzes the dehalogenation of halotyrosines such as 3-bromo-L-tyrosine, 3-chloro-L-tyrosine, 3-iodo-L-tyrosine and 3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine (PubMed:15289438, PubMed:18434651, PubMed:25395621, PubMed:28157283). During thyroid hormone biosynthesis, facilitates iodide salvage by catalysing the oxidative NADPH-dependent deiodination of the halogenated by-products of thyroid hormone production, monoiodotyrosine (L-MIT) and diiodotyrosine (L-DIT) (PubMed:15289438, PubMed:18434651). The scavanged iodide can then reenter the hormone-producing pathways (PubMed:15289438, PubMed:18434651). Acts more efficiently on 3-iodo-L-tyrosine than 3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine (PubMed:15289438).
