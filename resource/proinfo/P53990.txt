EntryName	IST1_HUMAN
ProteinName	IST1 homolog (hIST1) (Charged multivesicular body protein 8) (CHMP8) (Putative MAPK-activating protein PM28)
GeneName	IST1 KIAA0174
Length	364
Function	ESCRT-III-like protein involved in cytokinesis, nuclear envelope reassembly and endosomal tubulation (PubMed:19129479, PubMed:26040712, PubMed:28242692). Is required for efficient abscission during cytokinesis (PubMed:19129479). Involved in recruiting VPS4A and/or VPS4B to the midbody of dividing cells (PubMed:19129479, PubMed:19129480). During late anaphase, involved in nuclear envelope reassembly and mitotic spindle disassembly together with the ESCRT-III complex: IST1 acts by mediating the recruitment of SPAST to the nuclear membrane, leading to microtubule severing (PubMed:26040712). Recruited to the reforming nuclear envelope (NE) during anaphase by LEMD2 (PubMed:28242692). Regulates early endosomal tubulation together with the ESCRT-III complex by mediating the recruitment of SPAST (PubMed:23897888).
