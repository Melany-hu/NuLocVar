UniprotID	Q8TEA1
Accession	Q8TEA1;B0YJ54
EntryName	NSUN6_HUMAN
ProteinName	tRNA (cytosine(72)-C(5))-methyltransferase NSUN6 (EC 2.1.1.-) (NOL1/NOP2/Sun and PUA domain-containing protein 1) (NOL1/NOP2/Sun domain family member 6)
GeneName	NSUN6 NOPD1
Length	469
Function	S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase that specifically methylates the C5 position of cytosine 72 in tRNA(Thr)(TGT) and tRNA(Cys)(GCA) (PubMed:26160102, PubMed:27703015, PubMed:28531330). In vitro also methylates tRNA(Thr)(AGT) (PubMed:26160102, PubMed:27703015). Methylation requires, in the acceptor stem region, the presence of the 3'-CCA terminus, the target site C72, the discriminator base U73, and the second and third base pairs (2:71 and 3:70) in the tRNA substrates (PubMed:26160102, PubMed:27703015).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm
