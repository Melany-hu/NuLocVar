UniprotID	P20042
Accession	P20042;Q9BVU0;Q9UJE4
EntryName	IF2B_HUMAN
ProteinName	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit 2 (Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit beta) (eIF2-beta)
GeneName	EIF2S2 EIF2B
Length	333
Function	Component of the eIF2 complex that functions in the early steps of protein synthesis by forming a ternary complex with GTP and initiator tRNA (PubMed:31836389). This complex binds to a 40S ribosomal subunit, followed by mRNA binding to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). Junction of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S initiation complex is preceded by hydrolysis of the GTP bound to eIF2 and release of an eIF2-GDP binary complex. In order for eIF2 to recycle and catalyze another round of initiation, the GDP bound to eIF2 must exchange with GTP by way of a reaction catalyzed by eIF2B (By similarity).
