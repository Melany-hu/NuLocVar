EntryName	RDH5_HUMAN
ProteinName	Retinol dehydrogenase 5 (EC 1.1.1.209) (EC 1.1.1.315) (EC 1.1.1.53) (11-cis retinol dehydrogenase) (11-cis RDH) (11-cis RoDH) (9-cis retinol dehydrogenase) (9cRDH) (Short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 5)
GeneName	RDH5 HSD17B9 RDH1 SDR9C5
Length	318
Function	Catalyzes the oxidation of cis-isomers of retinol, including 11-cis-, 9-cis-, and 13-cis-retinol in an NAD-dependent manner (PubMed:10588954, PubMed:11675386, PubMed:9115228, PubMed:9931293). Has no activity towards all-trans retinal (By similarity). Plays a significant role in 11-cis retinol oxidation in the retinal pigment epithelium cells (RPE). Also recognizes steroids (androsterone, androstanediol) as its substrates (PubMed:29541409, PubMed:9931293).
Subcellular Location	Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
