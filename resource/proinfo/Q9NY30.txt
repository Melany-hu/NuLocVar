UniprotID	Q9NY30
Accession	Q9NY30;Q8NEH7
EntryName	BTG4_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein BTG4 (BTG family member 4) (Protein PC3b)
GeneName	BTG4 PC3B
Length	223
Function	Adapter protein that bridges CNOT7, a catalytic subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, to EIF4E (By similarity). Facilitates maternal mRNAs decay during the maturation of oocytes and in the fertilized egg, and is required for the maternal-zygotic transition (MZT), zygotic cleavage and initiation of embryonic development (PubMed:32502391).
