UniprotID	P84077
Accession	P84077;P10947;P32889
EntryName	ARF1_HUMAN
ProteinName	ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (EC 3.6.5.2)
GeneName	ARF1
Length	181
Function	Small GTPase involved in protein trafficking between different compartments (PubMed:8253837). Modulates vesicle budding and uncoating within the Golgi complex (PubMed:8253837). In its GTP-bound form, triggers the recruitment of coatomer proteins to the Golgi membrane (PubMed:8253837). The hydrolysis of ARF1-bound GTP, which is mediated by ARFGAPs proteins, is required for dissociation of coat proteins from Golgi membranes and vesicles (PubMed:8253837). The GTP-bound form interacts with PICK1 to limit PICK1-mediated inhibition of Arp2/3 complex activity; the function is linked to AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking, regulation of synaptic plasticity of excitatory synapses and spine shrinkage during long-term depression (LTD) (By similarity). Plays a key role in the regulation of intestinal stem cells and gut microbiota, and is essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis (By similarity). Also plays a critical role in mast cell expansion but not in mast cell maturation by facilitating optimal mTORC1 activation (By similarity).
