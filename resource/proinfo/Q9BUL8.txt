UniprotID	Q9BUL8
Accession	Q9BUL8;A8K515;D3DNN5;O14811
EntryName	PDC10_HUMAN
ProteinName	Programmed cell death protein 10 (Cerebral cavernous malformations 3 protein) (TF-1 cell apoptosis-related protein 15)
GeneName	PDCD10 CCM3 TFAR15
Length	212
Function	Promotes cell proliferation. Modulates apoptotic pathways. Increases mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and STK26 activity (PubMed:27807006). Important for cell migration, and for normal structure and assembly of the Golgi complex (PubMed:27807006). Part of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes. STRIPAK complexes have critical roles in protein (de)phosphorylation and are regulators of multiple signaling pathways including Hippo, MAPK, nuclear receptor and cytoskeleton remodeling. Different types of STRIPAK complexes are involved in a variety of biological processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism and immune regulation (PubMed:18782753). Important for KDR/VEGFR2 signaling. Increases the stability of KDR/VEGFR2 and prevents its breakdown. Required for normal cardiovascular development. Required for normal angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis during embryonic development (By similarity).
