UniprotID	Q96P53
Accession	Q96P53;B1AL86;Q96CS1
EntryName	WDFY2_HUMAN
ProteinName	WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein 2 (Propeller-FYVE protein) (Prof) (WD40- and FYVE domain-containing protein 2) (Zinc finger FYVE domain-containing protein 22)
GeneName	WDFY2 WDF2 ZFYVE22
Length	400
Function	Acts in an adapter protein-like fashion to mediate the interaction between the kinase PRKCZ and its substrate VAMP2 and increases the PRKCZ-dependent phosphorylation of VAMP2 (PubMed:17313651). Positively regulates adipocyte differentiation, by facilitating the phosphorylation and thus inactivation of the anti-adipogenetic transcription factor FOXO1 by the kinase AKT1 (PubMed:18388859). Plays a role in endosomal control of AKT2 signaling; required for insulin-stimulated AKT2 phosphorylation and glucose uptake and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT2 substrates (By similarity). Participates in transferrin receptor endocytosis (PubMed:16873553).
