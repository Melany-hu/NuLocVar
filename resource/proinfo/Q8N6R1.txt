UniprotID	Q8N6R1
Accession	Q8N6R1
EntryName	SERP2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 2 (Ribosome-associated membrane protein RAMP4-2)
GeneName	SERP2 C13orf21
Length	65
Function	Interacts with target proteins during their translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Protects unfolded target proteins against degradation during ER stress. May facilitate glycosylation of target proteins after termination of ER stress. May modulate the use of N-glycosylation sites on target proteins.
Subcellular Location	Membrane; Endoplasmic reticulum membrane
