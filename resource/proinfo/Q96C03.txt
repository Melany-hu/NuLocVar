UniprotID	Q96C03
Accession	Q96C03;J3KPT3;Q6ZRD4;Q96N07
EntryName	MID49_HUMAN
ProteinName	Mitochondrial dynamics protein MID49 (Mitochondrial dynamics protein of 49 kDa) (Mitochondrial elongation factor 2) (Smith-Magenis syndrome chromosomal region candidate gene 7 protein)
GeneName	MIEF2 MID49 SMCR7
Length	454
Function	Mitochondrial outer membrane protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial organization (PubMed:29361167). It is required for mitochondrial fission and promotes the recruitment and association of the fission mediator dynamin-related protein 1 (DNM1L) to the mitochondrial surface independently of the mitochondrial fission FIS1 and MFF proteins. Regulates DNM1L GTPase activity.
Subcellular Location	Mitochondrion outer membrane
