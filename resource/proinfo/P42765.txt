ProteinName	3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, mitochondrial (EC 2.3.1.16) (Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase) (EC 2.3.1.9) (Acetyl-CoA acyltransferase) (Acyl-CoA hydrolase, mitochondrial) (EC 3.1.2.-, EC 3.1.2.1, EC 3.1.2.2) (Beta-ketothiolase) (Mitochondrial 3-oxoacyl-CoA thiolase) (T1)
GeneName	ACAA2
Length	397
Function	In the production of energy from fats, this is one of the enzymes that catalyzes the last step of the mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathway, an aerobic process breaking down fatty acids into acetyl-CoA (Probable). Using free coenzyme A/CoA, catalyzes the thiolytic cleavage of medium- to long-chain unbranched 3-oxoacyl-CoAs into acetyl-CoA and a fatty acyl-CoA shortened by two carbon atoms (Probable). Also catalyzes the condensation of two acetyl-CoA molecules into acetoacetyl-CoA and could be involved in the production of ketone bodies (Probable). Also displays hydrolase activity on various fatty acyl-CoAs (PubMed:25478839). Thereby, could be responsible for the production of acetate in a side reaction to beta-oxidation (Probable). Abolishes BNIP3-mediated apoptosis and mitochondrial damage (PubMed:18371312).
