ProteinName	Non-structural maintenance of chromosomes element 1 homolog (Non-SMC element 1 homolog) (EC 2.3.2.27)
GeneName	NSMCE1 HSPC333 HSPC337
Length	266
Function	RING-type zinc finger-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase that assembles with melanoma antigen protein (MAGE) to catalyze the direct transfer of ubiquitin from E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to a specific substrate. Within MAGE-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, MAGE stimulates and specifies ubiquitin ligase activity likely through recruitment and/or stabilization of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme at the E3:substrate complex. Involved in maintenance of genome integrity, DNA damage response and DNA repair (PubMed:20864041, PubMed:29225034). NSMCE3/MAGEG1 and NSMCE1 ubiquitin ligase are components of SMC5-SMC6 complex and may positively regulate homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair (PubMed:18086888). MAGEF1-NSMCE1 ubiquitin ligase promotes proteasomal degradation of MMS19, a key component of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) machinery. Down-regulation of MMS19 impairs the activity of several DNA repair and metabolism enzymes such as ERCC2/XPD, FANCJ, RTEL1 and POLD1 that require iron-sulfur clusters as cofactors (PubMed:29225034).
