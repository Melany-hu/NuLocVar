UniprotID	P57076
Accession	P57076;Q53FH0
EntryName	CF298_HUMAN
ProteinName	Cilia- and flagella-associated protein 298 (Protein kurly homolog)
GeneName	CFAP298 C21orf48 C21orf59
Length	290
Function	Plays a role in motile cilium function, possibly by acting on outer dynein arm assembly (PubMed:24094744). Seems to be important for initiation rather than maintenance of cilium motility (By similarity). Required for correct positioning of the cilium at the apical cell surface, suggesting an additional role in the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway (By similarity). May suppress canonical Wnt signaling activity (By similarity).
Subcellular Location	Cytoplasm; Cytoplasm; Cytoskeleton; Cilium basal body
