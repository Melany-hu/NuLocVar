UniprotID	Q96KK5
Accession	Q96KK5
EntryName	H2A1H_HUMAN
ProteinName	Histone H2A type 1-H (H2A-clustered histone 12) (Histone H2A/s)
GeneName	H2AC12 HIST1H2AH HIST1H2AI
Length	128
Function	Core component of nucleosome. Nucleosomes wrap and compact DNA into chromatin, limiting DNA accessibility to the cellular machineries which require DNA as a template. Histones thereby play a central role in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA replication and chromosomal stability. DNA accessibility is regulated via a complex set of post-translational modifications of histones, also called histone code, and nucleosome remodeling.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus; Chromosome
