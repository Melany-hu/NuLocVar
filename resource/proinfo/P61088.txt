UniprotID	P61088
Accession	P61088;Q16781;Q53Y81
EntryName	UBE2N_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N (EC 2.3.2.23) (Bendless-like ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme N) (Ubc13) (UbcH13) (Ubiquitin carrier protein N) (Ubiquitin-protein ligase N)
GeneName	UBE2N BLU
Length	152
Function	The UBE2V1-UBE2N and UBE2V2-UBE2N heterodimers catalyze the synthesis of non-canonical 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains. This type of polyubiquitination does not lead to protein degradation by the proteasome. Mediates transcriptional activation of target genes. Plays a role in the control of progress through the cell cycle and differentiation. Plays a role in the error-free DNA repair pathway and contributes to the survival of cells after DNA damage. Acts together with the E3 ligases, HLTF and SHPRH, in the 'Lys-63'-linked poly-ubiquitination of PCNA upon genotoxic stress, which is required for DNA repair. Appears to act together with E3 ligase RNF5 in the 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of JKAMP thereby regulating JKAMP function by decreasing its association with components of the proteasome and ERAD. Promotes TRIM5 capsid-specific restriction activity and the UBE2V1-UBE2N heterodimer acts in concert with TRIM5 to generate 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains which activate the MAP3K7/TAK1 complex which in turn results in the induction and expression of NF-kappa-B and MAPK-responsive inflammatory genes. Together with RNF135 and UB2V1, catalyzes the viral RNA-dependent 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of RIGI to activate the downstream signaling pathway that leads to interferon beta production (PubMed:28469175, PubMed:31006531). UBE2V1-UBE2N together with TRAF3IP2 E3 ubiquitin ligase mediate 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF6, a component of IL17A-mediated signaling pathway.
