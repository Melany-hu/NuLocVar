UniprotID	Q6BCY4
Accession	Q6BCY4;Q9BVA3;Q9UF68;Q9UHJ0
EntryName	NB5R2_HUMAN
ProteinName	NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase 2 (b5R.2) (EC 1.6.2.2)
GeneName	CYB5R2
Length	276
Function	NADH-cytochrome b5 reductases are involved in desaturation and elongation of fatty acids, cholesterol biosynthesis, drug metabolism, and, in erythrocyte, methemoglobin reduction (By similarity). Responsible for NADH-dependent lucigenin chemiluminescence in spermatozoa by reducing both lucigenin and 2--3--5--2H tetrazolium monosodium salt (WST-1).
