EntryName	TINF2_HUMAN
ProteinName	TERF1-interacting nuclear factor 2 (TRF1-interacting nuclear protein 2)
GeneName	TINF2 TIN2
Length	451
Function	Component of the shelterin complex (telosome) that is involved in the regulation of telomere length and protection. Shelterin associates with arrays of double-stranded TTAGGG repeats added by telomerase and protects chromosome ends; without its protective activity, telomeres are no longer hidden from the DNA damage surveillance and chromosome ends are inappropriately processed by DNA repair pathways. Plays a role in shelterin complex assembly. Isoform 1 may have additional role in tethering telomeres to the nuclear matrix.
