UniprotID	Q9BYP9
Accession	Q9BYP9;B5MDD6;Q9BYQ1
EntryName	KRA99_HUMAN
ProteinName	Keratin-associated protein 9-9 (Keratin-associated protein 9-5) (Keratin-associated protein 9.5) (Keratin-associated protein 9.9) (Ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated protein 9.9)
GeneName	KRTAP9-9 KAP9.5 KAP9.9 KRTAP9-5 KRTAP9.5 KRTAP9.9
Length	154
Function	In the hair cortex, hair keratin intermediate filaments are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KRTAP), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins. The matrix proteins include the high-sulfur and high-glycine-tyrosine keratins.
