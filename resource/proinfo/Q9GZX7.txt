UniprotID	Q9GZX7
Accession	Q9GZX7;Q6QJ81;Q8NFC1
EntryName	AICDA_HUMAN
ProteinName	Single-stranded DNA cytosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.38) (Activation-induced cytidine deaminase) (AID) (Cytidine aminohydrolase)
GeneName	AICDA AID
Length	198
Function	Single-stranded DNA-specific cytidine deaminase. Involved in somatic hypermutation (SHM), gene conversion, and class-switch recombination (CSR) in B-lymphocytes by deaminating C to U during transcription of Ig-variable (V) and Ig-switch (S) region DNA. Required for several crucial steps of B-cell terminal differentiation necessary for efficient antibody responses (PubMed:18722174, PubMed:21385873, PubMed:21518874, PubMed:27716525). May also play a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by participating in DNA demethylation (PubMed:21496894).
