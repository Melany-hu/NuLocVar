UniprotID	Q13522
Accession	Q13522;Q6IB01;Q8TBJ2;Q8WWV2
EntryName	PPR1A_HUMAN
ProteinName	Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1A (Protein phosphatase inhibitor 1) (I-1) (IPP-1)
GeneName	PPP1R1A IPP1
Length	171
Function	Inhibitor of protein-phosphatase 1. This protein may be important in hormonal control of glycogen metabolism. Hormones that elevate intracellular cAMP increase I-1 activity in many tissues. I-1 activation may impose cAMP control over proteins that are not directly phosphorylated by PKA. Following a rise in intracellular calcium, I-1 is inactivated by calcineurin (or PP2B). Does not inhibit type-2 phosphatases.
