EntryName	ADRB2_HUMAN
ProteinName	Beta-2 adrenergic receptor (Beta-2 adrenoreceptor) (Beta-2 adrenoceptor)
GeneName	ADRB2 ADRB2R B2AR
Length	413
Function	Beta-adrenergic receptors mediate the catecholamine-induced activation of adenylate cyclase through the action of G proteins. The beta-2-adrenergic receptor binds epinephrine with an approximately 30-fold greater affinity than it does norepinephrine.
Subcellular Location	Cell membrane; Early endosome; Golgi apparatus
