UniprotID	Q9BXN1
Accession	Q9BXN1;Q5TBF3;Q96K79;Q96LD0;Q9NXP3
EntryName	ASPN_HUMAN
ProteinName	Asporin (Periodontal ligament-associated protein 1) (PLAP-1)
GeneName	ASPN PLAP1 SLRR1C UNQ215/PRO241
Length	380
Function	Negatively regulates periodontal ligament (PDL) differentiation and mineralization to ensure that the PDL is not ossified and to maintain homeostasis of the tooth-supporting system. Inhibits BMP2-induced cytodifferentiation of PDL cells by preventing its binding to BMPR1B/BMP type-1B receptor, resulting in inhibition of BMP-dependent activation of SMAD proteins (By similarity). Critical regulator of TGF-beta in articular cartilage and plays an essential role in cartilage homeostasis and osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis. Negatively regulates chondrogenesis in the articular cartilage by blocking the TGF-beta/receptor interaction on the cell surface and inhibiting the canonical TGF-beta/Smad signal. Binds calcium and plays a role in osteoblast-driven collagen biomineralization activity.
