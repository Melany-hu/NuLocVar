UniprotID	Q9Y2B1
Accession	Q9Y2B1;A8K017;Q6PKD6
EntryName	RXLT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Ribitol-5-phosphate xylosyltransferase 1 (EC 2.4.2.61) (Transmembrane protein 5) (UDP-D-xylose:ribitol-5-phosphate beta1,4-xylosyltransferase)
GeneName	RXYLT1 TMEM5
Length	443
Function	Acts as a UDP-D-xylose:ribitol-5-phosphate beta1,4-xylosyltransferase, which catalyzes the transfer of UDP-D-xylose to ribitol 5-phosphate (Rbo5P) to form the Xylbeta1-4Rbo5P linkage on O-mannosyl glycan (Probable) (PubMed:27733679, PubMed:29477842). Participates in the biosynthesis of the phosphorylated O-mannosyl trisaccharide (N-acetylgalactosamine-beta-3-N-acetylglucosamine-beta-4-(phosphate-6-)mannose), a carbohydrate structure present in alpha-dystroglycan (DAG1), which is required for binding laminin G-like domain-containing extracellular proteins with high affinity (Probable) (PubMed:25279699, PubMed:27601598, PubMed:27733679).
