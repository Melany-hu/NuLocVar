UniprotID	Q9P0R6
Accession	Q9P0R6;B3KSZ0;Q9BST1;Q9NWK0
EntryName	GSKIP_HUMAN
ProteinName	GSK3B-interacting protein (GSKIP) (GSK3beta interaction protein)
GeneName	GSKIP C14orf129 HSPC210
Length	139
Function	A-kinase anchoring protein for GSK3B and PKA that regulates or facilitates their kinase activity towards their targets (PubMed:16981698, PubMed:25920809, PubMed:27484798). The ternary complex enhances Wnt-induced signaling by facilitating the GSK3B- and PKA-induced phosphorylation of beta-catenin leading to beta-catenin degradation and stabilization respectively (PubMed:16981698, PubMed:27484798). Upon cAMP activation, the ternary complex contributes to neuroprotection against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by facilitating the PKA-induced phosphorylation of DML1 and PKA-induced inactivation of GSK3B (PubMed:25920809). During neurite outgrowth promotes neuron proliferation; while increases beta-catenin-induced transcriptional activity through GSK3B kinase activity inhibition, reduces N-cadherin level to promote cell cycle progression (PubMed:19830702).
