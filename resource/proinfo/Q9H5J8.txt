UniprotID	Q9H5J8
Accession	Q9H5J8;Q6I9Y6
EntryName	TAF1D_HUMAN
ProteinName	TATA box-binding protein-associated factor RNA polymerase I subunit D (RNA polymerase I-specific TBP-associated factor 41 kDa) (TAFI41) (TATA box-binding protein-associated factor 1D) (TBP-associated factor 1D) (Transcription initiation factor SL1/TIF-IB subunit D)
GeneName	TAF1D JOSD3
Length	278
Function	Component of the transcription factor SL1/TIF-IB complex, which is involved in the assembly of the PIC (preinitiation complex) during RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription. The rate of PIC formation probably is primarily dependent on the rate of association of SL1/TIF-IB with the rDNA promoter. SL1/TIF-IB is involved in stabilization of nucleolar transcription factor 1/UBTF on rDNA. Formation of SL1/TIF-IB excludes the association of TBP with TFIID subunits.
Subcellular Location	Nucleus
