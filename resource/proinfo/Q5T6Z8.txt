UniprotID	Q5T6Z8
Accession	Q5T6Z8;A0A9K3Y7R5;D3DQ49
EntryName	Q5T6Z8_HUMAN
ProteinName	Transmembrane protein 59
GeneName	TMEM59 hCG_33694
Length	192
Function	Acts as a regulator of autophagy in response to S.aureus infection by promoting activation of LC3 (MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B or MAP1LC3C). Acts by interacting with ATG16L1, leading to promote a functional complex between LC3 and ATG16L1 and promoting LC3 lipidation and subsequent activation of autophagy. Modulates the O-glycosylation and complex N-glycosylation steps occurring during the Golgi maturation of several proteins such as APP, BACE1, SEAP or PRNP. Inhibits APP transport to the cell surface and further shedding.
