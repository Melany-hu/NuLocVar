EntryName	MAGT1_HUMAN
ProteinName	Dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide--protein glycosyltransferase subunit MAGT1 (Oligosaccharyl transferase subunit MAGT1) (Implantation-associated protein) (IAP) (Magnesium transporter protein 1) (MagT1)
GeneName	MAGT1 IAG2 PSEC0084 UNQ628/PRO1244
Length	335
Function	Accessory component of the STT3B-containing form of the N-oligosaccharyl transferase (OST) complex which catalyzes the transfer of a high mannose oligosaccharide from a lipid-linked oligosaccharide donor to an asparagine residue within an Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus motif in nascent polypeptide chains (PubMed:31831667). Involved in N-glycosylation of STT3B-dependent substrates (PubMed:31831667). Specifically required for the glycosylation of a subset of acceptor sites that are near cysteine residues; in this function seems to act redundantly with TUSC3. In its oxidized form proposed to form transient mixed disulfides with a glycoprotein substrate to facilitate access of STT3B to the unmodified acceptor site. Also has oxidoreductase-independent functions in the STT3B-containing OST complex possibly involving substrate recognition. Could indirectly play a role in Mg(2+) transport in epithelial cells (Probable).
