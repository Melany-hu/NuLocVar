ProteinName	Reticulon-4 receptor-like 2 (Nogo receptor-like 3) (Nogo-66 receptor homolog 1) (Nogo-66 receptor-related protein 2) (NgR2)

Length	420
Function	Cell surface receptor that plays a functionally redundant role in the inhibition of neurite outgrowth mediated by MAG (By similarity). Plays a functionally redundant role in postnatal brain development. Contributes to normal axon migration across the brain midline and normal formation of the corpus callosum. Does not seem to play a significant role in regulating axon regeneration in the adult central nervous system. Protects motoneurons against apoptosis; protection against apoptosis is probably mediated by MAG (By similarity). Like other family members, plays a role in restricting the number dendritic spines and the number of synapses that are formed during brain development (PubMed:22325200). Signaling mediates activation of Rho and downstream reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (PubMed:22325200).
